# Forgive the Karen
Anyone who lives in Manhattan and has made it through the last few months without going completely crazy deserves a prize.

The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/nyregion/amy-cooper-dog-central-park.html">Karen story</a> with the off-leash dog in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramble_and_Lake">Ramble</a>, an area I am familiar with, imho deserves a second chance. Wouldn't that be great if out of the virus we learned to forgive. Give her the dog and the job back and accept her apology. 

As someone who used Central Park when I lived in the city, the rules are broken a lot, my peeves were no smoking and no bike riding on the walking paths. Two rules I felt strongly about, as the man did about off-leash dogs interfering with birding in the Brambles. 

A lot of NYers, even when they aren't stressed by isolation, act in a way that might look insane to someone not from NY, when you say they've violated the rules governing use of space. 

And NYers are sensitive to those rules being broken because there is so little space. It's kind of a powder keg that way, even in normal times. 

She did something awful, but it doesn't rise to the level that requires her life to be destroyed. I think it would be good for all of us if we perhaps just this once practiced forgiveness.
