<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law">Gall's Law</a>: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."
