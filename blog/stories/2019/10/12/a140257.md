# Running Unix apps in background
For an application I'm developing I need to run it in the background, yet easily stop and relaunch it. So this is what I do. 
1. At the command line type <i>nohup node app.js &</i> and press Return. 
2. You can see the output of the app by pressing Ctl-C then <i>tail -f nohup.out</i>. It creates this file in the directory the app was run from.  
3. To kill the node process and any other node processes it might have launched, enter <i>killall -i node</i>. The -i flag means that it will confirm before killing each process.  

I put these notes in my blog so I can find them again, easily, and don't have to figure it out ever time. Also so people who know more than I do about this topic can tell me better ways to do this. :orange:
