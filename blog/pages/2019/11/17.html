<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172131"></a>Following up on yesterday's <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/16/153957.html">american.newbie</a> piece. True story. I went to eat Chinese food with my Mom a few years ago. Highly rated <a href="https://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/flushingstore_eng.html">restaurant</a>. In the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/136-21+37th+Avenue,+Flushing,+NY+11354/@40.7619076,-73.8325639,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2600fe1184edf:0xc9f4b28c9f22d92a!8m2!3d40.7619076!4d-73.8303752">neighborhood</a> I grew up, many years ago when it was a sleepy boring place with an embarassing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens">name</a>. Most of the people spoke Chinese. We had to wait quite a while for a table. When we were seated the waiter asked if we were tourists. I laughed and said no we're natives. The funny thing is that not that long ago we were the newbies. The food was fantastic, btw. So many flavors, very satisfying. Before the Chinese came, Flushing was famous for nothing in the way of anything, in the last <a href="https://macaulay.cuny.edu/seminars/gardner08/articles/f/l/u/Flushing_History_d81a.html#Dutch_Rule">three centuries</a> at least. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/17.html#a172131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I love getting comments from people I see who read my stuff. It's an affirmation that I exist, in some fashion, and at least one person is listening. I like that. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">Alan Kay</a> said that Macintosh was the first PC worth criticizing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e">Jean-Louis  Gassée</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/03/10/speakingOfTheCluetrain.html#4">says</a> the higher the monkey climbs a tree, the more people can see his  derrière. I criticize Warren as a front-runner, the likely nominee, and because POTUS is an important job, esp the next one. It's not enough to win as Democrats, we have to win for the Constitution. Overlook our differences just for one election. There used to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Republican">liberals</a> in the Republican Party, no reason the Democratic Party can't have expat Repubs. We're fighting for our soul as a country. Imho everything else is a detail to be worked out later. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/17.html#a170255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

First impression, I tweet a lot, and most of it is uninteresting a day later. I realized what I want most are tweets that are't links, rt's or replies. Original stuff. An idea that could possibly turn into an interesting piece on the blog. So I adjusted the app so that it splits them up into the four categories. I've pasted below the four classes of tweets from yesterday.
