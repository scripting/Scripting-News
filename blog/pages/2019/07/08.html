<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a195817"></a>Journalism and jury duty. I agreed strongly with what Emily Bell said <a href="https://twitter.com/emilybell/status/1148298094146129921">here</a>. Jury duty is a powerful idea, and it works. It's the basis for our justice system. I've written about jury duty many times, in <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/02/08/whyShouldYouJoinAJury.html">2017</a>, <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/whatILearnedFromJuryDuty">2013</a>, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/29/juryDutyDay2.html">2008</a>, and <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html">1996</a>. (The last piece is probably the best, I did it for Wired as well as my blog.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/08.html#a195817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175921"></a>Observation. If you're going to use a CDN that doesn't let you overlay your own domain name, and your code is coming from an S3 bucket, it's much easier to use <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com">s3.amazonaws.com</a> and no less independent of another entity. I imagine this is okay with Amazon because it's lock-in. But this is a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/nbariver/index.html">river</a> that works over HTTPS, the URL Is uglier than shit, but it works. It's an important milestone because my users have legit reasons to want to make rivers accessible via HTTPS.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/08.html#a175921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think that's due to the award incentive of the system. Flow == more followers == power and prestige. I wonder if there's a way to reward people based on the depth and originality of ideas they post, or RT. Zero points for repeating a talking point from a random hack on Meet The Press. Huge points for an idea that makes people want to consume less. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/08.html#a151410" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But after the net, that's what we all do all the time, go places. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/08.html#a151150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
