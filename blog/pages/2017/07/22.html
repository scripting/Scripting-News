Not a huge fan of desktop notification, but that's a separate issue. The team that did this package did it well, with good examples, and attention to detail. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a055139" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Of course this makes sense. When I have a project of some importance, sending an email directly to someone who I want to review it elicits the most responses. But it's inefficient. And the more you do it, the less power each email has. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a102523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a102557"></a>Suppose I had an Node package in development that I think represents a basic technology for news distribution. Do I have to send emails to the people I think of to get access to their minds? And what about the creative thinkers who I either don't know, or didn't think to send an email to?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a102557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a102658"></a>Our idea distribution system is non-existent. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is like a nuclear shotgun, there's so much there how do you find the stuff that's relevant.

		<li><a name="a102735"></a>I'd like to have a channel that's for serious releases only. If something is a maintenence release, or just the beginning of an idea, it wouldn't be thought of as important. However, when a technology has matured and is ready for other minds to consider it, there ought to be a way to get it looked at. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a102735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a091637"></a>It's an <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron app</a>, which means that under the hood it's a web/node app packaged to run on the Mac desktop. (To say it's an Electron app is a bit of an understatement, it was the app that Electron was developed to run. The two begat each other, a very important software design principle. They factored well.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a091637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090507"></a>It's a programmer's editor. I use it for lightweight stuff, as a viewer for technical documents. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a090507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090520"></a>I edit my JavaScript source in an outliner. Sometimes it's nice to be able to view it flattened, so I use it for that (I also use GitHub for the same purpose, funny how they come from the same company). Or when an error message refers to a specific line number, they have line numbers, my outliner doesn't, so I drag the JS file onto the Atom icon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a090520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090538"></a>I use it to view a JSON file when I'm working on code that works with that kind of file. A very handy way to keep it around as a reference. And I look at RSS feeds and OPML files in all their XML glory using Atom. I even use it for light touchups to config.json files for some of my apps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/22.html#a090538" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090603"></a>It's playing the role that BBEdit plays for some Mac users or X-Code, or probably an IDE on Windows.
