I agree with all of it. When a protocol or format is much more complicated that it needs to be, there's usually a reason, the proponents want to say they're compatible and open without having actual <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/19.html#a021150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a025209"></a>BTW, I read in a news article the other day that I developed iPodder, the first podcasting client in 2004. This is not true. The first podcasting client was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand">Radio UserLand</a> in 2001. I did not write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_(aggregator)">iPodder</a>, it was a community effort. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/19.html#a025209" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But I have to just as strongly <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/Cz068Apuycp">disagree with him</a> about OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. I don't go for hype in tech, I'm very much a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri#Etymology_and_pronunciation">Show Me</a> kind of guy. Every time I think of a new use for ChatGPT I'm blown away by what a <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/14/130813.html">breakthrough</a> it is. Not just impressive tech, which it certainly is, but how incredibly useful it is. And how it understands my questions. And its infinite patience and good manners. I'm not trying to change Jeff's mind, but just to say I think my friend got this one wrong. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/19.html#a134706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
