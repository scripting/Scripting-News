<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023050"></a>Took care of life details today, sold a car, voted, and realized I've been pushing it really hard programming for most of the year.  Learned a lot, made new friends. Looking forward to working with users and developers this winter, and of course fixing bugs. A big new product release coming soon. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/07.html#a023050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a034234"></a>My car had huge numbers of mice living in it. When I started the engine and drove it some of the mice who were living in the engine died. Later when I got in the car it smelled terrible. So I took a picture of the car with the mice in it, and I want DALL-E to draw that for me.
