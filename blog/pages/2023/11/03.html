	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142431"></a>I don't believe a product like <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> should do its own identity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/03/141515.html#a142431" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142443"></a>Identity is one of those things you totally want centralized, because that's the benefit of identity -- you can be the same person in a lot of different places. And if we work that out well, the apps that you connect with that way can work with each other in interesting ways to provide new integrations. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/03/141515.html#a142443" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151139"></a>I've always been preaching this, let developers and users do the integration, let software developers create basic capability that we can wire together any way we like. That was what we were doing on the Mac platform in the 1988-92. And also what we've been doing on the web since 1994 . It's an idea as old as <a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mamrak.1/CIS762/pipes_lab_notes.html">Unix pipes</a>. But it requires cooperation among developers, which we have seen sometimes happens. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/03/141515.html#a151139" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143549"></a>Using <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/226">WordPress for identity</a> is a step in that direction. The hope is it could form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone">backbone</a> for an internet of applications. I'm willing to step up and say okay let's give this a try and see what happens.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/03/141515.html#a143549" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
