<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a013502"></a>The first miracle of the web was that people could <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html">write</a> and share knowledge.

Also it turns out a number of established feed readers already do the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278">right thing</a> with image enclosures. So that nails it, this is the way to do it. Support in FeedLand will be added shortly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/18.html#a152214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
