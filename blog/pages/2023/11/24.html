Maybe the most American holiday of all. But it's also a time to be jolly and kind, nice not naughty, doing our part to consume at ever-increasing rates to keep the US economy humming. And it's a time for love, one hopes. Even so it's time to put <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/325a58fa-1957-47f3-833f-f34b4151721b">Santa</a> in his place, in the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/24/santaInTheMargin.png">margin</a> of Scripting News! I did my part today, buying a nice curved monitor for my Mac mini, and a new smaller TV for the den. Socks and a couple of nice shirts.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/24.html#a164237" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165320"></a>I'm working on a new version of the Scripting News home page, the first since 2017. There will be more tabs, that run down the left margin instead of the top. It'll have the <a href="http://scripting.com/homepage.html">content</a> of Scripting News in the first tab, as it works now. And the <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/returnlinkbloghtml?url=http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">linkblog</a> will be the next tab. Then the tabs from <a href="http://news.scripting.com/">news.scripting.com</a> followed by the About page <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/aboutpage.opml">outline</a>. And lots of room for growth, for new ideas for writers and readers. As always I use my own site to experiment with new web ideas. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/24.html#a165320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
