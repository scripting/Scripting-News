<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/10/24/rssCoffeeMug.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144450"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/10/24/rssCoffeeMug.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here's a <a href="https://artshow2.scripting.com/">demo app</a> that scrolls through pictures recently posted by one of the <a href="https://lists.feedcorps.org/artshow.opml">art feeds</a> on Bluesky. Artshow is not itself a feed reader, it calls FeedLand, <a href="https://feedland.com/getriverfromreadinglist?url=https://lists.feedcorps.org/artshow.opml">via an API</a>, to get the recent posts from feeds in the list. It's all very simple, small pieces loosely joined. An illustration that there’s more to feed “reading” than we might think (podcasting is a another form of feed reading that doesn’t look like a feed reader). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/16.html#a144450" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">my feed</a> on Bluesky. You can hook that up to any feed reader, obviously. But think about it, this is something new. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/16.html#a135746" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But our right to continue to live is always up for debate.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/16.html#a144441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
