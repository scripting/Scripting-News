I have great teachers who are encouraging me, and of course are experts in and proud of WordPress, and as a result I think <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> are going to work together in some very nice ways. Getting pretty close on some of it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/22/135755.html#a135808" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135842"></a>A year ago I didn’t even know that WordPress still had APIs. At some point the code I had that worked with WordPress via the <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog">MetaWeblog API</a> broke, and I assumed that it was the end of the line, and took the feature out of my linkblogging tool. But I was wrong. And not only that there was <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso</a>, a modern REST interface, that works in the same model I use for FeedLand and <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. It’s all there. I love it. All kinds of integrations will be possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/22/135755.html#a135842" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140450"></a>Getting FeedLand to work in the new environment has been a step by step process. It was built to run on a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> server, with a file system. I’ve converted now all the pieces we needed, and it seems finally to run smoothly.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/22/135755.html#a140450" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
