Photographs. Paintings. News. The consensus seems to be that we should use the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt">enclosure</a> element, as with podcasting. In this case, if the type begins with "image/" then an <i>artcast</i> viewer should handle it, and others should ignore it. We were at this place with podcasting in 2001, and needed some examples, so we had a feed of <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml">Grateful Dead music</a> to start using the technology. Here's the artcasting <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/artfeed.xml">test feed</a>. Try subscribing to it in a feed reader you like. Hopefully it either ignores the enclosure or it does the right thing with it, displays it. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278">thread</a> for comments, questions and screen shots. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/17.html#a222122" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162117"></a>I think a basic hookup to a chatbot is going to become part of the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> spec pretty quickly. So far the best one I've seen is Guy Kawasaki's. I want to be able to ask for a list of things I've written on a given topic, and to be able to ask the questions in the same straightforward way I ask ChatGPT.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/17.html#a162117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
