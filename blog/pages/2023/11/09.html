We first look for feeds that are <a href="https://dri.es/rss-auto-discovery">linked into</a> the HTML source code. If we don't find a working feed there, we <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/demos/feedhunter/feedhunter.js#L56">look in 27 common locations</a> where feeds are often found. And btw, there's a new version of <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> that uses this package, so we do better at finding feeds. Thanks to the <a href="https://indieblog.page/">Indieblog</a> site which keeps a great <a href="https://indieblog.page/export">list</a> of blogs with feeds. We used that info to come up with our list of default locations. We also used the list of feeds people have subscribed to in FeedLand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/09.html#a141419" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161101"></a>For FeedLand users and others, how did you feel about the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/276">starter feeds</a> you were offered when you first signed on?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/09.html#a161101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172045"></a>The thing people don't like about AI isn't that the machines are trying to be human, rather it's that you could be a machine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/09.html#a172045" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154132"></a>I wonder if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> tried to do a deal with ChatGPT to flow human knowledge through their database. Or were they caught as flat-footed as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica">EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica</a> was by Wikipedia, or how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera#Types_of_digital_cameras">digital cameras</a> were obsoleted by smart phones. Was there anything any of them could do, or was there no possible corner-turn? Also newspaper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising">classified ads</a> and Craigslist.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/09.html#a154132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143752"></a>I asked DALL-E to help create an icon for <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter">Feed Hunter</a>. I can't imagine an art director at an agency not using AI to play around with ideas for logos, symbols, ads, whatever. What I arrived at was a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/09/feedHunterIcon.png">tennis racket</a> trying to hit a cheeseburger. I didn't end up using it, but the exploration was useful. I think this process still has quite a ways to go, I find it difficult to control the bot, I give it explicit instructions sometimes that it apparently doesn't understand. But it's still a miracle of technology. And a miracle for this human, because I've found an artist that is infinitely patient with me, and works for $20 a month.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/09.html#a143752" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
