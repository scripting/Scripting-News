What if we had met, or known about each other? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/10.html#a145516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153101"></a>I just tripped over a 2018 rewrite of <a href="https://this.how/phoenix/">Developing Better Developers</a>. I remembered writing this, but never could find it. I need to tell Google when I search for site:scripting.com to also include site:this.how. If anything the bits on this.how are more important than the ones on the much larger scripting.com. I could give these instructions, just like this, to ChatGPT and it would understand. It seems to me Google could start allowing us to configure the way Google sees us using natural language like this. Google has really held back the open web, by doing what big companies <i>always</i> do when they achieve dominance. Things ether stagnate or more likely in Google's case, move backwards. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/10.html#a153101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/08/teslaModelY.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191204"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/08/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Something happened on the drive to Boston last week that makes we wary of trusting the FSD feature of my Tesla model Y. I was on the NY State Thruway going north, a few miles south of the exit for I-90E to Boston, in <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">FSD mode</a>, in the right lane, when I see a hundred yards or so ahead a car with flashing lights in the shoulder. Before waiting to see what FSD would do, I signaled a left turn, which is a clever feature that tells the FSD software to switch lanes. It started to do so, then the software must've noticed the car with the flashing lights and inbetween the two lanes it hit the brakes hard, and slowed us down to a dangerous speed, esp if there had been a car behind us. But there was absolutely no danger. The car in the shoulder wasn't even close enough to make a difference if we had remained in the right lane, but we were leaving it. And it tried to stop us in no man's land. Insane. Anyone seeing this behavior would have thought I was drunk. So next time something like that happens if I'm in FSD mode, I'm going to cancel it by turning the steering wheel slightly and taking over fully. I have trouble believing people who let this thing drive without overriding it regularly.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/10.html#a191204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's a rewrite of thread.center which I wrote for Twitter, which Twitter never noticed before shutting it down. One of these days there will be a platform that really pays attention to what developers create and makes sure users learn about them. Twitter was not that company. Like most tech companies they spent their dev relations money on the wrong things. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/10.html#a150541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152400"></a>Fixed a bug where every this.how doc would fail trying to load emoji images because it used an "insecure" address. I fixed it so now we can be sure no emoji images are being hacked by a router between AWS and your web browser. Hopefully someone will sleep better because of this. Me, I like fixing bugs so I feel good. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/10.html#a152400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
