<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154925"></a>ChatGPT can <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39">make tables</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/05.html#a154925" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155831"></a>Back in the 1970s when SQL was new, it was touted as an English-like database language. Now with ChatGPT you really can do database queries in actual English and it understands. Amazing. Whether the info is accurate or not (I suspect it is) is beside the point. It's doing something with language that has not been possible before. Check out <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39">this query</a>. "Make a table of 15 oscar-winning actors and actresses ranked by number of nominations, also include a column with the names of at most three of the movies they made that won best picture."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/05.html#a155831" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135240"></a>Yesterday I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1698786873701695772">full-length excerpt</a> of the <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google and HTTP</a> piece on Twitter, and was surprised at the positive response. I had posted links to the full article many times, and mostly got flames from programmer priests, Googly trolls, but this time the message got through. It was RT'd 58 times, and got 24K views. Not bad for something most people would consider esoteric, yet is still fundamental to their continued freedom on the unowned open web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/05.html#a135240" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134658"></a>Just for fun the other day I asked ChatGPT for <a href="https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2023/09/04/christopher-lydon-and-amanda-palmer/">150 words</a> on Christopher Lydon and Amanda Palmer, wondering if it would find the connection between them. It wrote a paragraph profile on each, but did not discover that Palmer had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2IrTbWJxY">written a song</a> about Lydon. Note -- Google's search function totally made the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=amanda+palmer+christopher+lydon">connection</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/05.html#a134658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/01/siliconValley.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131516"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/01/siliconValley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Yet another use-case for ChatGPT. I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js">wpcom package</a> for Node.js to make calls about a user's WordPress account. I want to know what sites the user is following in their reader app. But they don't document the high-level call for that function, which <i>is</i> <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1.1/get/read/following/mine/">documented</a> at the REST level. So I ask ChatGPT what to do and it gives me the code I need. In the past I would probably have been able to piece it together with guesswork, trial and error. Might have taken a whole day. Now I have it working while I'm still drinking my morning coffee. BTW, I also had ChatGPT do code review, and it spots an error, and of course I fix it, happily.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/05.html#a131516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a110240"></a><a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/111012177596560602">Posted on Masto</a>: I find that ChatGPT is far better than Wikipedia at recounting history I know the truth about. Less subject to human manipulation, imho. When we criticize the machines we should remember what we have to compare them with and we should get <i>our</i> act together. Imagine if the AIs wrote critiques about our accuracy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/05.html#a110240" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
