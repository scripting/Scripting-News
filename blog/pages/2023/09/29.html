	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134740"></a>The first scene of Season 3 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)">Fargo</a> has always puzzled me. It takes place in East Berlin during the Cold War. A citizen is brought before a government official where he's asked to confess to a crime that apparently was actually commited by a different person who used to live at the same address. The story then moves to Minnesota, and there's no further mention of the characters or plot of the first scene. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/29/133214.html#a134740" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134849"></a>I've always wondered why was that scene there, what it has to do with Fargo. Here's my theory.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/29/133214.html#a134849" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134925"></a>Every episode of Fargo begins with "This is a true story. The events depicted took place in {location} in {year}. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of the respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/29/133214.html#a134925" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134941"></a>It's funny because that's what the opening scene is. A supposedly true story (we don't actually know it's true, we suspect not, same as with the show itself) but the names have been changed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/29/133214.html#a134941" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135009"></a>Everything in Fargo is nested that way. That's one of the reasons it's so much fun to re-watch, you see things each time you didn't see before.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/29/133214.html#a135009" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
