<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162918"></a>When I was a kid I used to think how most of the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/11aa73fe-dae1-4c3c-a77e-e3f951a68b1f">stars of really old movies</a> were dead. How far removed from my existence. I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p66R294bDZc&t=429s">clip</a> of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/01/1191242224/actor-paul-reubens-who-created-pee-wee-herman-dies-at-70">Pee Wee Herman</a> and realize he was just as dead as Lucille Ball, Raymond Burr, Judy Garland, Jim Nabors, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe. For that matter he's just as dead as Ben Franklin.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22.html#a162918" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133505"></a>I have a local friend who went to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">high school</a> so we have an important cultural reference point, and a local friend who was raised a few blocks from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/29-31+170th+St,+Queens,+NY+11358/@40.7696367,-73.7974495,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!8m2!3d40.7696367!4d-73.7948746!16s%2Fg%2F11bw4jbj00?entry=ttu">where I grew up</a>, another strong cultural reference point. We can converse about many things without explaining because we started from the same place. I didn't know either of these people when I was growing up, just met them in the last few years. Same sort of thing happened at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Berkman">Berkman</a> reunion. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22.html#a133505" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125607"></a>I was feeling very competent. Unfortunately the feeling was an illusion, the kind of mistake a novice makes. After a long day of wrestling with a codebase, you're in need of relaxing MSNBC<i>isms</i> -- not another tech challenge; and I am most definitely not a novice at making messes of a working piece of software. I've been doing it for 50 years! Half a century of software mayhem. It's even worse than it appears. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a125607" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123912"></a>Anyway, it appeared to work for the first few calls as I stepped through the code in the debugger, and then confident (still) I let it rip, and a horrific error message appeared about something called <code>flQueueAllRequests</code> which presumably I put there a few years ago, and I panicked: "Revert! Time to revert Davey!" I said to myself, possibly in my mind or possibly out loud even. But alas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm">NPM</a> will not let you revert. The version numbers must move forward, never backward. How little the designers of NPM really understood about software development. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a123912" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124106"></a>Once a very long time ago, in 1976, I thought that they shouldn't put programmers in offices on the 39th floor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building">Empire State Building</a> with windows that open. I had a similar desperate empty feeling last night at 8PM. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a124106" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124142"></a>I tried to revert as best as I could, but the horrific crash persisted, and I did something I never do, I got up from the computer with the software I'm working on broken. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a124142" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124155"></a>Then I woke up in the middle of the night and thought "Davey you're not going to sleep any more, so get up and find the freaking problem." So I did. I got up. But I did not find the freaking problem. I wrote a sad missive to the people I'm working with asking for sympathy and help. And when I finally woke up for real at 7:30AM, with the sun out, birds singing, feeling rested and ready for a new challenge, I sat down, before eating breakfast or drinking coffee, rolled up my sleeves and set about fixing the problem. My first three attempts didn't work, then I finally thought of something I might do that did in fact fix the problem, and now I can breathe again. <i>Whew.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a124155" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124232"></a>As a result of this novice move and its consequences I'd like to ask the NPM folks to come up with a way to say "get me the latest version of this package" instead of devising complex ways of saying whatever it was I was telling it to do that it did that made my software behave so badly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a124232" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135618"></a>PS: Seriously, once I understood what the problem was I <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/6fcc5702-75e5-4581-960c-040cc5c01549">asked ChatGPT</a> for the answer, and it's surprisingly complicated. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/22/123759.html#a135618" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
