<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143741"></a>BTW, are you seriously telling me "security" couldn't have been added to the web without breaking every single freaking link? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/18.html#a143741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145318"></a>I'd like to have a chat with the secret unaccountable person who is breaking the web at Google. How about running your ideas past me before you break the web.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163339"></a>It also describes what we should have done when Twitter first came along, what I would have done if I were them. We would have had a much different situation now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/18/163325.html#a163339" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163347"></a>Textcasting also says that all the tribulations of Activitypub aren't necessary. No one has bothered to think this through at the top level, everyone is working in niches, not really aware of what anyone else is doing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/18/163325.html#a163347" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163202"></a>Journalism also refused to look. So they were guided into a gulag by Twitter and now they don't like it. If anyone had thought through where they were going, that would have led to <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> too. They should have owned the new news environment, instead they and we were <a href="https://this.how/trolls/#1515276557000">controlled</a> by it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/18/163325.html#a163202" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163400"></a>The thing that keeps me focused is writers. It's all about writers, what tools they need to think and collaborate, without boundaries. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/18/163325.html#a163400" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
