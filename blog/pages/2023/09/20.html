It has to be that simple. Based on what Google announced yesterday, and what Facebook is likely to announce this week, it's clear that the big tech companies are only going to allow you to access your data if it's stored in their silos. We need something just as powerful and easy that works with content on the open web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/20.html#a133758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

As a matter of policy I do not write about that kind of stuff on my blog, but <i>mama mia</i> it's pretty amazing what it will report on.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/20.html#a140319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
