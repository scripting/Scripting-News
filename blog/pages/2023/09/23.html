A chat system for bloggers? Threads hanging off each post? Cross-linking? Let's have long and short form work really well together. I know all about the technology that will make this possible, but what's important is that it's a process, not an event. We should start working on this now and keep working on it for years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/23.html#a141236" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140952"></a>I need a free or almost free service where I can <i>quickly</i> create an email address that's forwarded to my Gmail account, to create all the Bluesky accounts I need to. Any ideas? Also I have created a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/threadwriter.bsky.social/post/3ka2zye64fm2d">new account</a> for <a href="https://blue.thread.center/">Thread Writer for Bluesky</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/23.html#a140952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140616"></a>I've created a lot of Gmail accounts over the years, but I don't remember what most of them are! I thought I could <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/23/bardtalk.png?nodialog=true">ask Bard</a>, with its new interface to Gmail to give me the list, but either I don't know how to ask the question, or it's not ready with that kind of data? No matter what, we're in very early days for this. Also I think Google should spin off its AI stuff, they're too much of a monopoly to monopolize this. Yes, I can hold all these ideas in my head at the same time, you can too. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/23.html#a140616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
