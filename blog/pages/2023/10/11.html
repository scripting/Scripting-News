<div class="divSingularItem" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131945"></a>Much of the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a> is the question of whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_(The_Matrix)">Neo</a> is <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/2e24d0bf-f77f-4b17-9a14-1b4ca0ae2df2">The One</a>. Much of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUN1ClT9i9w">best dialog</a> in the movie is about that. In the world I live in today we're looking for The One for social media, the open platform that can replace the silos. The feeling is there is now a chance to do that, it wasn't there before and it may not be there again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/11.html#a131945" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131558"></a>Why will it never work? Why is Mastodon <i>not</i> The One? I know, because I thought <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> should do what Twitter ended up doing and the main reason that happened is that to follow someone in Twitter is one click, and you're done, and I don't even want to write down the process for feeds because it's even worse than what it is in Mastodon today.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/11/131337.html#a131558" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/frankfurter.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131659"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/frankfurter.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Not that we didn't know this at the time, we did, or how to solve it at a technical level. I tried to get everyone to work with us on making subscription simple, but it didn't happen. Later I came to believe it couldn't. We <i>could</i> force everyone to use the same <a href="http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">export format</a>, that worked incredibly well. But every RSS reader developer acted as if they were the only product that did what they did and didn't want to do anything they didn't have to to make it easy for people to subscribe in other reader software. It's so convoluted and stupid, you have to figure the people making the actual decisions had never used an RSS reader and never wanted to subscribe to a feed. This, btw, is pretty common in the tech industry, product ignorance among key decision-makers. I even heard a CEO once boast that he didn't need to use the product because he's a 'market of one' as if all his customers were frankfurter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstituted_meat">meat</a>? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/11/131337.html#a131659" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131821"></a>Here's the bottom line. If subscription isn't one-click in your federated social media system, go back to the drawing board and re-do your architecture, because it won't work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/11/131337.html#a131821" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
