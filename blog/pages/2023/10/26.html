I put together a list of art feeds on Bluesky, this is something that actually exists, in feed form thanks to <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/23.html#a115734">John Spurlock</a>. After Twitter collapsed, the art flow went to Bluesky, and they have feeds, and we picked it up in FeedLand. This is <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>, and it's working once again. <i>Bing! </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/26.html#a191017" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

That happened to me just now when I tried to load the page from my iPad. Unfortunately I don't think there's a way to do a hard-reload on iOS as a user.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/26.html#a193136" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In FeedLand, I wanted to be able to see the news for each category, no matter where I was. I could be looking at something totally random and I want to see the news for MLB. Or I want to see if I'm subscribed to a particular podcast. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/26.html#a170406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
