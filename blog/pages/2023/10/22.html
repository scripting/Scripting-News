When I do a podcast on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> I just create another item in <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">my feed</a>, alongside all the others. I don't see any reason people should have to have a special feed for podcasts, when it's so easy for clients to ignore items that don't have enclosures. So I've been trying to hold the door open for that (also I'm lazy). There's a 1-minute <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/quickDemoPodcast.m4a">podcast</a> attached to this item as a demo.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22.html#a145756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And I've pretty much been converting anything that builds on those apps to HTTPS as well. As a side-effect I had to convert the image URLs in Scripting News, which is served by HTTP, to HTTPS so they wouldn't show up as broken images in FeedLand. They almost certainly have been showing up broken in other feed reading software, for years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/012515.html#a151535" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012905"></a>Anyway, even though it would be relatively easy to convert scripting.com to HTTPS, it would break every single image that appeared before 2023. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/012515.html#a012905" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012943"></a>I will also never do it for the simple reason that this site goes back to 1994, and if I switched to HTTPS now, well what about all the other sites of its era that are breaking due to this really ill-conceived corner-turn. And who there are so many subdomains of scripting.com started over 30 years and left standing, and all the HTTP urls hanging off them, I'll retire long before I consider that much crazy work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/012515.html#a012943" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a013044"></a>You don't accumulate 30 years of archives thinking someday you're going to convert every page and thus break all the images. I can't imagine a change that could more totally break the web. And yet somehow we've let that happen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/012515.html#a013044" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a013102"></a>Scripting News is one of the foundation sites of the open web, it goes back further than probably anything that's still updating. Scripting News is angry that Google is deliberately breaking the open web, even though Dave the system developer would rather just go ahead and switch. Google is playing mass psychology on us, getting us all to believe that giving them full control to evolve the web is somehow a reasonable thing. It won't happen here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/012515.html#a013102" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170514"></a>It's weird that people have the idea that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+thinking+out+loud">thinking out loud</a> is a new idea for blogging. That's because when journalists first heard about blogging they decided that it's what they do. People who write publicly for money, mostly without any principle other than getting paid for writing, or perhaps "building a brand." That imho was not what was going on. It was people asking questions, often in the form of statements they weren't sure of. Put it out there, see what comes back. At its best it was what I called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+sources+go+direct">sources go direct</a> -- where people with expertise shared what they knew so we could learn from them. So the idea of a public "garden" is just a response to journalists getting the story totally wrong about blogging in the early days. Amazing how these things cycle round and round often because of basic misunderstandings like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/011943.html#a170514" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171411"></a>I love to cite this <a href="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/10/cartoon.gif">cartoon</a> from the 2004 Democratic Convention which first opened its doors to bloggers. I was one of them. They saw us as gatecrashers. We were just people who have the need to blog. A small number of people were born to write about what they see, and the web opened that up to all of us, for the first time it took almost no money to get your ideas out there, and clearly they were scared of us. What a crime that actual people would be reporting on the events of our democracy. They're so stuck in their calcified thought patterns that it never occurred to them that this is great, people who actually give a shit, wanting to tell other people what they saw and heard. Unfortunately they got their way, that's how powerful they are and how easily manipulated we all are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/22/011943.html#a171411" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
