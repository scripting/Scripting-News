<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200251"></a>I was talking with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsandquist/">Jeff Sandquist</a> yesterday, a friend from long ago when he was in developer support at Microsoft. He now works at Automattic, makers of WordPress. We're both old enough to remember Filemaker and PFS:File which were user-oriented databases for the Mac and PC in the 1980s. It was a new idea then because there were no easy-to-use file management products on minicomputers, these were products for users of personal computers. I wondered it there wasn't a position for a lite version of WordPress, a user interface designed for one person, not a group. I created a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/274">prototype</a> of what I call <i>WordPress-for-One</i> as part of a project to get support for the WordPress API into my codebase. It's just enough WordPress for one writer. That's the idea.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/25.html#a200251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152951"></a>I am adding another degree of complexity to the implementation of reading lists. Already in a programming structure that works against you at every step. The thing you have to go for is actual code that reads as clearly as pseudo-code. In JavaScript you are so far from that. Every little loop requires you to do a dance that's a pain in the ass when you're writing the code, it's 100 times worse when you're trying to find the bug that's hiding in the freaking haystack. But -- you can do it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/25.html#a152951" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Inside you can see a dark maze with cobwebs and doors and scary creatures -- it's JavaScript code! and it's a nighmare. There a human in there, a laborer in a devil's workshop and it's struggling to get the door on the safe closed so we don't have to look at any of the monstrosities it contains. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/25/204821.html#a204957" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
