Of course there must be many tools out there that do what this does, not claiming any kind of breakthrough, just something that might be useful to some people. I've been using it myself to write WordPress blog posts. If you have comments or questions, post them <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/274">here</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/06.html#a184855" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's like half the product was missing. For example, here's a list of all <a href="https://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&catname=podcasts">my podcast feeds</a>. There was no way to do this before.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/06.html#a184601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a002424"></a>Journalism could do some good by focusing on the <a href="https://wapo.st/45qulMJ">proposal</a> the House Dems are making to possibly persuadable Repubs. Treat it seriously. Ask Repubs what they think. I think there's still some amount of honor, if not in the representatives, in the people. With press air cover, people could call their reps, write op-eds and blog posts, picket, collect signatures. Protest. It's a good thing to discuss. When and if the political depression in America lifts, this is what what it will look like. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/06.html#a002424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's very easy to support in a CMS, so people tend to do it. My site has the feature.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/06/003914.html#a003926" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
