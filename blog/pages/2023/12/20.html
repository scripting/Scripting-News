It means being able to write scripts that use an application as a scriptable toolbox, going behind the user interface. I was developing a product around that idea called Frontier. It all happened, and played a big role in making the Mac the ideal development platform for the web when it came along, in the early-late 90s. Unfortunately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Apple's top people</a> didn't get this, and wiped out the whole developer community in one press conference. The ideas were still useful and we're using them every day, but not really aware of it. End of speech.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/20.html#a150230" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The state of Colorado had decided to use one of the <a href="https://wapo.st/3TBQQw3">guardrail</a> buttons to extinguish the candidacy of HH, just like that. This morning I woke with a smile on my face and thought, hey it could happen, it <i>should</i> happen.

It's possible they'll decide that the Constitution applies to every officer of the United States government except the president and vice-president, I'd love to hear the reason, and if they do, we'll know that we've already lost. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/20.html#a135341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140529"></a>If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I'd like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There's nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we're on leads, and don't give people a reason to hope that it's not as serious as it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/20.html#a140529" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's implemented in a week, if you're really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vociferous">vociferous</a> users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they're pissing in the wind. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/20/152127.html#a231127" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
