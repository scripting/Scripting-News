<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a011722"></a>In the reporting on the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2">Colorado Supreme Court</a> and the 14th Amendment, I've not heard the most basic reason why Trump can't be President. Here's why. He took an <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/">oath</a> to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He did the opposite, he attacked the Constitution. So how can we ask him to take the same oath again, the one that he violated the last time he took it. The Constitution is very wise, it's what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou">Maya Angelou</a> <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371">taught</a> -- when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. That's why he can't be president again. He can't be believed when he takes the oath, and if he can't take the oath he can't be President. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/22.html#a011722" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm much better at it this go-around than the last time. Generally I can get it done in three or four moves. If it takes five it's because I made a mistake or took a gamble on the second move that didn't work out. These days I don't even try for the second move, but this morning, on the first move I got four out of the five letters, and got the correct position of two of the four. It took a couple of seconds to see that there was really only one answer, so I decided to risk it, and there was this moment we yearn for when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg">letters reveal</a> one at a time, all green, a final correct move, in two. First time I've ever gotten that result. I wasn't even sure it was possible. Well there it is. Almost <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/22/9999.png">perfect</a>. Nothing more to say than Yay Me! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/22/222552.html#a145333" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152845"></a>Conversation has a place, but I think we've explored that pretty well, and now I want to create better publishing and reading systems, that are as fast as social web systems, but place less emphasis on replies that can be seen by everyone, because that often is not really conversation, it's spam. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/22/154133.html#a152845" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154454"></a>I think ultimately we'll be disappointed with federation for all the reasons we're frustrated with earlier social web systems. People trying to get attention for their ideas, which often are spam or trolling. I also think this means RSS will be more valuable going forward because it's great at publishing, checking all the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> boxes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/22/154133.html#a154454" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153616"></a>I plan to build with and around WordPress. I think of WordPress as a basic platform the way I saw Twitter between 2006 and 2022. Now the question is what are the steps to use WordPress as the back-end of a social communication system. Behind the scenes, its database has all the capabilities we need to provide the tools writers need. And it has excellent RSS support. It all runs at scale and has a mature yet simple API.  That is all we need to form a hub.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/22/154133.html#a153616" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
