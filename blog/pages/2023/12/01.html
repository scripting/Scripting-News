We asked them to support image enclosures (aka artcasting) in <a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fphotos%2Ffeed%2F">their feed</a>. They just did. And as a result their flow <a href="https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fphotos%2Ffeed%2F">looks outstanding</a> on FeedLand, which totally supports this format. This is a bell-ringer event, this is what we're about -- building up and out from where we are in the land of feeds. We can do a lot if we work together. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/01.html#a170840" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145610"></a>Remember <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/786af3a9-c35c-499f-8e97-f4b7017415ab">Bingeworthy</a>? It fell off the air when Twitter blew up their API. I keep wanting it back, because I keep watching shows that should be in its database. I miss it. Then I realized it's not that different from the <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">group of explorers</a> who are putting their app choices into feeds. The Bingeworthy database is people, shows and ratings. The simplest relational database possible. It would be easy to represent each user as a feed, where each item is a rating. The link for each item would be a pointer to the Metacritic page. And then give each feed a category of <i>bingeworthy. </i>From there, we explore.  BTW, this is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/a5b3ac43939954c4af6759a9ce27989f">SQL code</a> that creates the BW database. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/01.html#a145610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
