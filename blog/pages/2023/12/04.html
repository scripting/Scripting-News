I think I understand the game much better now. I do sometimes make mistakes, and always pay for them. The thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling when you press Return to see the result of your first guess. It's like opening a present, only better. If you get two green tiles, you can bask in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I've never gotten it in two, and I don't usually try, and when I do it's usually a mistake, I would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love, self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five green tiles open up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg">one at a time</a>. That's the feeling that keeps me coming back day after day. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/04.html#a132849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
