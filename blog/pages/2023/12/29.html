And we've gotten out of the habit of trying out new ideas with our networks. And we're building systems that depend on the kindness of our peers and big companies, and keep learning that this is not a kind world. All this is why we've been spinning our wheels for 17 years, and unless we start working together, for real, we'll just keep spinning.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/29.html#a162330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But I'm not sure everyone is seeing the new version. In the new version there are <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/29/newsScriptingScreenShot.png">icons</a> on each tab. If you're seeing the icons, all is good, if not, try clearing your DNS cache? The domain should point to 143.198.165.199.
