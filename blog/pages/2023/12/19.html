I've tried to evangelize the idea, but it didn't happen. In the end I punted, and used Mastodon's API, and thus <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting">my software</a> only works with services that implement their API.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a161653" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html">last resort</a> to keep a nightmare out of the government.  An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171011"></a>A thought -- this kind of feature could not have been offered a year ago.

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130507"></a>I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at <a href="https://www.colonywoodstock.com/">The Colony</a> in Woodstock. It's small venue that <a href="https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/">goes way back</a>. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19/131648.html#a130507" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132905"></a>I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin">Tony Levin</a>, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19/131648.html#a132905" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130936"></a>The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin">Pete Levin</a> on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19/131648.html#a130936" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132114"></a>The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19/131648.html#a132114" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131346"></a>To me, music is as software probably is to most people who use it. I love it, but I don't have much of an idea of how it's made. The last few years I've been reintroduced to it in a new way, <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention">thanks</a> to <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead">the</a> <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE">Get Back documentary</a>, which gave us a view into the Beatles' creative process, something I wish I could have seen when I was much younger. The Beatles were the music my generation grew up with, but I never really even understood that there was a difference between a John song and a Paul song. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19/131648.html#a131346" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
