A bunch of my pieces really pissed him off, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/11/howInvestigativeResearchHa.html">like this one</a>. You didn't have to guess where you stood with him. And he listened when you told him he was all fucked up and full of it and didn't understand the first thing about what you said. He was from Alaska and I am from the east and west coasts. We were friends. I'lll miss his caustic and broad dismissals. I knew then and now that his heart was in it, and it is a good heart. <span style="opacity: 0.4"><span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span></span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/16.html#a181815" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's a great talker and story-teller and philosopher, and a great human being. I had never heard him interviewed before, or read anything written by him, but I watched all his TV shows in the 70s. The people in them were people from my neighborhood, but funnier. Why should it be surprising that the stories this man told in real life were the same ones he told in his scripts. Now I want to find more interviews with him. Great stuff.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/16.html#a171518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204657"></a>No matter how hard we try, no matter how much we want to make a difference, for most of us, all the difference we make happens when we're alive, there is no lasting value to our existence after we're gone. Most people know that, but some people (like me) struggle against it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/16.html#a204657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154922"></a>I'm starting to scope out if it would be possible to create an Electron version of FeedLand. I had a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e825efea-c271-4c24-8594-01a03c21f3af">conversation</a> with ChatGPT about that. We did not arrive at a plan. FeedLand uses MySQL, I can't convert to another SQL, we have to use the same codebase in all versions. If, after reading the chat, you have ideas, please post a note <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/282">here</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/16.html#a154922" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
