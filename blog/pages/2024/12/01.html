Just listened to his <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/the-big-interview-with-dan-rather/the-big-interview-with-steven-van-zandt">interview</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Van_Zandt">Steven Van Zandt</a> of the E Street Band and the Sopranos. There are <i>nine</i> seasons of this podcast between 2013 and 2021. Going to keep me busy for a while. The <a href="https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/8e6d7e9c-00fb-4434-b699-b07a012cac5b/1c515561-6a90-4cfb-8f70-b07d0142b4bf/34077f42-ce99-472a-9884-b07d0149f32f/podcast.rss">RSS feed</a> works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/01.html#a201620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to lift the hood even if I don't understand what I'm looking at.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213715"></a>I'm using the term "RSS-based podcasts" in place of "podcasts" to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other "podcasts," are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their "podcasts" to RSS and everyone's happy. Like "organic cheeseburgers." :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/01.html#a213715" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154838"></a>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/01.html#a154838" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140918"></a>Welcome to the last month of <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/01.html#a140918" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/01/folder.png">norm</a> is about 120K. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/01.html#a141059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
