<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171040"></a>I have United Healthcare insurance. I got it as part of my Medicare package when I turned 65. I've had good experience with them. I had major surgery in 2002, cost hundreds of thousands, included a one-week hospital stay and lots of followup treatments. I know the hospital did all the work with them, I was shielded from any complications, but as far as I know there were none. Never had a treatment questioned or denied. I had another insurance provider for many years after that, but when given a chance I went back to United. Just want to say, so far -- knock wood -- I am a happy customer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11.html#a171040" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143952"></a>Just added to my todo list -- add the option to use the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi">WordPress REST interface</a> in place of the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js">WPCOM interface</a>, this will give <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> the ability to edit WordPress sites anywhere, not just on wordpress.com. When I made the choice to go with WPCOM I didn't have ChatGPT to look at the other options, I was surprised to find that WordPress actually had a good JavaScript API. It doesn't look like the conversion will be too bad. It's obviously better to be able to work with all WordPress sites. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11.html#a143952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150820"></a>No more elections where Hope is the main theme. Better: Kicking ass. Kicking ass is for ass-kicking Americans. I personally <i>like</i> Hope, but I'm also a sports fan and understand the value of kicking ass. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11.html#a150820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203310"></a>A valued tester of <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> asked a series of questions, which I answered in some detail, and felt it was a good idea to post the answers here on my blog.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#a203310" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203338"></a>Any kind of feedback you want to give is totally welcome. I'd prefer it be in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues">GitHub issues section</a> so it might inspire other people to contribute. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#a203338" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Re image insertion, I'm not sure it could be simpler. The goal is to get an image into the user's document. If it succeeded at doing that then I'm happy with the design. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>The target audience is writers who use WordPress. The idea is to put all the features writers need in one place, rather than scattered around the WP interface. And to use modern UI techniques you'd see in social web apps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203456"></a>I've tried to answer the questions you raised in the only way I can. For example I need to use a term for the arrows that move you through the stories you've written. They aren't all posts, but they are all drafts. I can explain that in the docs, but I seriously doubt if anyone would read them. There is a distinction and it's important to make that distinction. I also don't think it's crucial to get that one "right" -- not that I think there is a right answer to that one other than removing the feature, which I like having there because it emphasizes that we're working with a set of documents that you can edit.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#a203456" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>In all cases, you could raise any issue you have, I will think about what you say, but accept my response, and trust that I've incorporated your experience as data that might inspire a change in the design at some point. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>But do understand that a lot of thought has already gone into this, and a quick review by a new user is no substitute for a product design.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I know the docs are non-existent. I am limited in the time I have and the commitments I've made. The truth is that even dedicated users won't read them. I know that by the questions they ask. But I will write the docs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>What I suggest is you try using the product for its intended purpose, and assume that all feedback is welcome (it is) but once it has been registered, you should move on to the next thing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203344"></a>I've worked with testers many times going back a very long time. I've even hired testers. I don't take offense to critiques of the software.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/11/203305.html#a203344" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
