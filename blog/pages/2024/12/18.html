<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/14/julieAndrews.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160909"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/14/julieAndrews.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've got a new project called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt">davegpt</a>, it's in GitHub, open source of course. I also created a <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-using-projects-in-chatgpt">ChatGPT project</a> with the same code. Presumably I can ask it questions about the code. Because I have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a> file in the GitHub project, ChatGPT understands where I want to take this project. Most amazing, it wrote a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">summary</a> of what it saw in the project. I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">added that</a> to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown, it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT. It's such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it's happening. And what a delight that it has an API. I don't mind that I'm paying for it, I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that couldn't have been created before. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/18.html#a160909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
