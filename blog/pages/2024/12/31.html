It's not polite to say it's exhausting and boring, and seems pointless. Then I happened to hear Jimmy Carter himself, on the latest <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/30/g-s1-40405/former-president-jimmy-carter-the-fresh-air-interviews-part-1">episode</a> of the Fresh Air podcast, and that was fantastic and totally worthwhile. It had been a long time since I listened to him, and I've grown a lot since then. Listen to the person, much more interesting than people talking about the person.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/31.html#a174839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202201"></a>In addition to a $20 per month ChatGPT account, I also have a full Gemini account because I bought a snazzy new Pixel 9 Pro which comes with one year of Gemini included. So far that's just meant that I get pop up dialogs all over the place telling me I can use Gemini with Gmail, Google Drive and whatever else. Honestly it's just annoying. I do not want these apps to do my writing for me. Please. That imho is not a valuable use of AI. I can write for myself thank you very much.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/31.html#a202201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142517"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1">Braintrust query</a>: I'm kind of stuck with my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lej4s4kysc2u">little feed reader</a> in Bluesky. It works, but a few hours into it, at 10PM last night, we start getting rate-limit errors from bluesky. If it really is a rate limit, shouldn't reset after a while?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/31.html#a142517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
