<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133258"></a>I'm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lej4s4kysc2u">playing</a> with using Bluesky as a very simple feed reader. 1. Running up against its lack of style and formatting. Very bare bones. Not sure if people will like. 
2. What's the rate limit? My app is getting rate-limited with not very many posts. (According to their <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits">docs</a> on rate limits, I don't think my project is anywhere near the limit. It's creating posts. I'll start counting them, I guess.)
