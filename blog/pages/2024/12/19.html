It will drive you down blind alleys. It rewrites your code to conform to its standards. It has a terrible memory. Forgets things you told it specifically not to forget. It does not keep promises. People who say the bubble is fully inflated on this stuff are not paying attention. We're still dealing with very basic features. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/19.html#a172939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a232030"></a>I'm thinking maybe we'll do a Kickstarter for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>. It'll cost money to run the server and continue to develop the sofware. It fills a big enough need to ask the users to support it financially, at least to get it off the ground. The server is open source so theoretically anyone can run one. But in practice most people will probably just want to use the service. I just want to solve this problem so we can start building a developer ecosystem around WordPress that it's never had. Think of WordLand as a pump primer. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/19.html#a232030" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160815"></a>I watched <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber">Ari Melber</a> last night and noted he isn't yet on Bluesky or hasn't updated his show graphics to include it? He usually tries to be leading edge in this, and at this point he looks a bit behind the times, imho, ymmv etc. After Melber, I stayed through the opening segment of Joy Reid and was charged up by her intro. She's clicking on all cylinders. They must be thinking about gutting or reconfiguring MSNBC at this time. It's up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/01/msnbc-comcast-cable-news-for-sale-elon-musk-trump">for sale</a>, I wonder if a billionaire will see the wisdom of owning that piece of real estate as Musk saw the value in Twitter, far beyond what the stock market valued it at. (BTW, I should add that I benefited from his largesse, I was a very <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/15/0295.html">small shareholder</a> in Twitter at the time. I did not want to sell, but my vote didn't matter. Heh.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/19.html#a160815" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Presumably these are all things the NYT wouldn't let him run? Or if he submitted them, would they edit them into mushy nonsense. I've been there, I quit Wired when they edited my pieces, with my name on them, where I said things I thought were inane, things that I most definitely did not say. There's never been a better illustration of the importance of blogging and the value that's removed by publishing in the NYT. If a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2008/10/13/princetons-paul-krugman-wins-nobel-economics-0">Nobel Laureate</a> like Krugman can't get his ideas out that way, with the huge advantage in circulation they have (as Wired did over my humble blog), then there must be a reason to have blogs after all. I don't think he will be my BOTY for 2024, but maybe next year, if he keeps up the intelligent irreverence. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/19.html#a155019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
