These are all worthy goals, but in my experience Mozilla has been an <i>obstacle</i> to these things. I wrote in a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/113617569413777710">comment</a> on Mastodon, "A long time ago they invited me to present my ideas, and like an idiot I thought that's what they wanted, instead it was an ambush, people mostly wanting to ridicule me because they thought anything that a person does can't be any good, it has to come from a big company like Mozilla or Google. I thought then and still do now, how do they justify wasting their time on such a ridiculous thing. I kept on doing what I was doing, but switched off their browser first chance I got." If they really want to get behind projects that make the open web stronger, I'd be happy to help guide them, but only if they've sobered up and take that mission statement seriously, instead of just as a justification for holding on to their jobs a little bit longer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/08.html#a152308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
