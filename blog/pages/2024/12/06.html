<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222841"></a>When Bluesky was experiencing its huge post-election surge, it was exciting because lots of us users were experiencing the surge in followers and engagement. It was exhilirating. That has slowed to nothing now, no more engagement there than on Threads, Masto or Twitter. The character limit on Bluesky being considerably less than the others makes it harder to rekindle interest imho. And btw the euphoria being gone is neither good or bad, it just is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a222841" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220057"></a>ChatGPT is also a tutor. I'm learning new ways of coding SQL through drill and it's also improving my JavaScript code. It's infinitely impatient. It does make mistakes, but that's also good for the drill, catching the mistakes is instructive too. And in programming you always have to be looking for errors, because you'll almost always find them. "Runs the first time" is a rare occurrence, no matter who wrote the code."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a220057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I wish Elon Musk wasn't associated with it. If there were a good alternative to the Tesla, I would divest in a minute. I could afford to do it and would welcome the opportunity.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a150415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151018"></a>I'm getting a new <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22apple+watch%22">Apple Watch</a> today, the latest model. My current watch, which I wear all the time (except when it's charging) is a 5th gen. The new one is 10th. I had to upgrade because there's a Tesla watch app out now that won't run on my old watch. It's the most rational add-on for the car. A must-have.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a151018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
