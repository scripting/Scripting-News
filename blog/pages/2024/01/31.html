The code still runs on reasonably current Macs, but not the latest. I really should be working on Linux not Mac. If it weren't for my dependence on Frontier, I would be. I actually think ChatGPT might be a great programming partner for a meaty operating-system-like project like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/31.html#a145010" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150014"></a>As I was writing the post about using ChatGPT to port Frontier, which is a C program, runs on Mac and Windows, GPL licensed, to Linux. This took me to an interesting place. Could a bot, having read all the source code of MySQL, for example, then be tasked with writing a non-GPL MySQL workalike that would <i>not</i> be open source? Here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Software_using_the_GPL_license">list</a> of popular GPL-licensed software. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/31.html#a150014" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
