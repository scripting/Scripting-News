I was part of the PC wave in the 80s when writing tools advanced incredibly quickly. So many directions -- from line-oriented editors on Unix and early Apples, to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/0cfe7783-d6aa-4350-9d32-f9a81efc8e4b">screen editors</a>, then with the Mac we got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">wizzy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress">page</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker">layout</a>, and outliners for thinking and presentations. In the same time period programming changed from something requiring a million dollar investment in hardware and infrastructure, to something most students could afford. Just ten years. Since then our world has been reduced to copying and pasting into tiny text boxes. The question is bigger than if we need journalism, the question is do we need writers? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14.html#a160204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they would arrange things this way.
