Then, enjoying a huge cheeseburger with Slavic ketchup, and after that I accidentally hit the Return key, and for the rest of the strip she was a teacher at Portland State University, skiing at Mt Hood Ski Bowl, as she was in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/19/204120.html">previous version</a>. I find this stuff endlessly entertaining, for now at least, because drawing like this was something I never could do myself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/20.html#a145910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

She's a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck's, which she gets from a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3818612,-71.1198074,3a,75y,313.45h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss6IPyoxMNQaPkqRfO8TULg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">store on Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus.
