We're supposed to leave a good trail behind us, but I've only managed to do that in certain ways. For example, I have standardized on a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a> file for each of my projects and I'm pretty good about updating it. I also publish the OPML source of my code, which contains a lot more in the way of internal docs than the JavaScript files I publish alongside them, simply because the outline format lends itself to inline docs, and I have been doing that systematically for at least thirty years. And I now include the OPML source in most projects in a file called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/source.opml">source.opml</a>. There's a big comment at the top of each of the files at the top that explains. If you're interested, work backward through the <a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">directory</a> of my repos. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10.html#a165431" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140911"></a>I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase that seems wrong to me, I'll work on it until I figure out why it seems wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a140911" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141135"></a>Why I say that:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a141135" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141139"></a>Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would be overturn. Overturn doesn't convey the illegitimacy of what Trump tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American values. He tried to "overturn" our most sacred ritual, the transfer of power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people. Overthrow is a much better word for what was done. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a141139" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141416"></a>When you commit a crime, say for example killing someone, we don't say they tried to illegally use a weapon, that's too technical, we say they're "accused of murder." We focus on the consequences. There are lots of ways to illegally use a weapon, what matters is the intended result.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a141416" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141623"></a>There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all circumstances. It's spelled out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">20th Amendment</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a141623" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141929"></a>On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when Joe Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0">took the oath</a>, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath, at 12PM exactly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a141929" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012034"></a>You can also look at the government as a continuous thing, the only difference is there is a new person occupying the office of president. Same government, the one defined by the Constitution.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142019"></a>So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn't follow the Constitution.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/10/140854.html#a142019" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
