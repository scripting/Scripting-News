Started out simple, and over years it turned into a TTIM. Perfect example. Someone should study it, to figure out why Sun, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle et al wanted a protocol for interop and invested years in it, and yet it returned little in the way of interop.  I know that <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> is still in use, I imagine that SOAP probably is too, in some form. I wonder how it shook out. On the other hand <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> wasn't turned into a nightmare, and has become a <i>productive</i> tech industry mess, the most unusual thing ever, a true unicorn. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/22.html#a184055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153853"></a>I re-watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook">Silver Linings Playbook</a> over the weekend. I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, and this is a pure JL showcase. But the best moment was stolen by Robert DeNiro who is batshit crazy like most of the characters in the movie when he tells his son in two sentences about our purpose on the planet, which of course is to love Jennifer Lawrence. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/22.html#a153853" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152906"></a>Why isn't there a karaoke website where I can sing along with <a href="https://www.dead.net/song/ripple">Ripple</a> with the lyrics scrolling by. Could we do it together over the internet? It probably doesn't exist because of Hollywood tightasses. But surely there must be some uncopyrighted music we could try this. Hey I bet it actually exists. Send me a link.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/22.html#a152906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
