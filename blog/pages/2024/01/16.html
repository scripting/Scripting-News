So if you have an account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven't gotten used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as it seems it can.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/16.html#a153348" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I am a paying user, I don't want to do any more than I'm currently doing with it. I just want to be able to keep an archive of everything I do, in a format that's more useful to me.  (Update: They do have a simple API, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction">documented here</a>.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/16.html#a180357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
