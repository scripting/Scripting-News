<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152709"></a>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and say "learn this" and then a few hours or days later I'd be able to ask it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of therapy.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/08.html#a152709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I sincerely hope it's not on Facebook's Twitter replacement. That would like "meet the new boss, same as the old boss but much richer and better managed."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/08.html#a150525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
