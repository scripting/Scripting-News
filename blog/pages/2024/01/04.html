This tab, the one I'm writing into now, is for <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. I have one for my development work, general notes, not project-specific. And tabs for all the projects I've been working on in the last few days or in some cases weeks or months. From a writing standpoint, it doesn't matter whether they're on different sites, the idea of a site is not even in the user interface of my editor. In WordPress it's everything. The usual caveat: unless I'm missing something. I imagine people use browser tabs to work on more than one document at a time? I keep thinking there's a lot of stuff we can do to make WordPress work better for writers, I'm trying to be nice about this, but it doesn't work at all for me as a writer. I want it to work. I still can't believe there aren't a dozen different approaches to writing in WordPress. Seems like a fair amount of innovation is possible. I'm a writer who also is a developer. This has been bugging me for the last year or so. Why do I think WordPress is so important? 1. Obviously it has a huge installed base. If there's an opportunity to create something that even a small number of them would like, it's worth doing. 2. WordPress is the only product out there that supports <i>all</i> the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. So If I want lots of outlets for basic text writing, you have to start somewhere. Luckily there's WordPress, sitting there, ready to be recast as a social media app. If you know me, you know I <i>love</i> puzzles like this. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/04.html#a212251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151046"></a>The usage of <a href="https://news.scripting.com/">news.scripting.com</a> keeps going up. All elements of an item are optional, however at least one of title or description must be present. I'm interested in knowing what you think, what you like, what could be improved, does it give you ideas, how can we help. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/286">place for comments</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/04.html#a151046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152714"></a>A <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/9577">discussion</a> about whether a feed reader should support titleless items. It should, without question. The <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt">spec</a> is very clear. "All elements of an item are optional, however at least one of title or description must be present." It's how social media sites like Bluesky, Mastodon, et al hook up to the RSS network. Their posts not only don't require titles, they don't allow them, something I'd like to see them ease up on, per <a href="https://textcasting.org/#1683634931000">textcasting</a>. Let the writer decide if a post needs a title. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/04.html#a152714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
