<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204740"></a>After Katrina I <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/12.html">went to New Orleans</a> to see what was left, esp in the areas where there was a 15-25 foot storm surge in coastal Mississippi. If you went inland from the coast for a few miles there was nothing left. No trees, only a few skeletal all-concrete buildings where the beach used to be, otherwise <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/73989089/in/album-1588659">everything destroyed</a>. What you don't necessarily realize that it isn't just 15 feet of water, it's 15 feet of stormy ocean with cars and building debris being pushed around floating in the water. This <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DA5zrXQJVYE">video</a> on Threads provides a visual illustration of what a 9 foot surge is like.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a205740"></a>Thanks for all the good wishes re the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/07.html">30th anniversary</a> of the start of blogging here. It's not the same as it was at the beginning, but it's still pretty good. And to all the friends no longer with us, and there are plenty of them -- you are appreciated, respected and missed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/09.html#a205740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
