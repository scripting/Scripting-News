<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143557"></a>What a sad situation. What started with the open web in the 90s is now owned by billionaires, who, looking for new worlds to conquer have adopted a fascist buffoon as their frontman. It was never supposed to be owned by anyone.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/25.html#a143557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This must go back at least as far as the 2016 election and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy">Hillary‚Äôs emails</a>. The editorial people broke the wall, deciding to give the readers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/">the first glimpse</a> we‚Äôve gotten into the inner conflicts of one two most influential news orgs in the country.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235639"></a>Until now this was the one story they would never report on. Truly a milestone. And now that the window is open, open it further. Report on how a major news org holds back stories that would be of intense interest to the people, if only the news orgs did their jobs. This is where the "public editors" never went, and should have gone.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135335"></a>Why hasn‚Äôt the NY Times run a story that takes Trump at face value and explains to voters what it would be like to live in that United States? It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/25/142159.html#a135335" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142856"></a>A news story on this subject should include calls to all the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx">justices</a> on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/25/142159.html#a142856" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143431"></a>Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/25/142159.html#a143431" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
