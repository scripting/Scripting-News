<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/30/grannySmithApple.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134140"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/30/grannySmithApple.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I did the first demo of my new editor to a couple of developers I'm working with on our ActivityPub project, something I'm ever-more-excited about. Happy to say the demo was a success. They appeared to love the product, and for the right reasons. It makes WordPress into a fantastic writer's platform. This is what I love to do more than anything. People think I'm most interested in protocols and formats, but that's just part of it, and not the main part. I love making writing tools. I got interested in that in the late 70s working on editors for programming languages, then ran a company that made the same kind of editor, outliners, for writers, and then with Frontier went back to programmers. Now I'm trying something new. I want to create a whole category of editors. Editors where none existed before but should be there. The web. Instead what we have in 2024 is a lot of <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a> that hoard your writing making it pointless for developers to compete for writing tools that writers love. So writing on the web remains something that's not for writers. That's freaking stupid! Anyway right in the middle of all this is the perfect product, really a platform -- WordPress. It needs 100 great editors. I'm going to provide the first, and the toolkit to create more. Then Murphy-willing I'm going to create another editor, to show that it can be done. Then I'm going to kick back and smell the roses, a lifetime's work done, so now I can play. It's looking like the plan might just work.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a134140" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140612"></a>What <a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-donald-trump-economy-stock-market-tariffs-1851684972">Musk has been saying</a> is cover for what the oligarchs did to the Soviet Union as it was breaking apart. Only the US has vastly more wealth. And unlike Trump, Musk understands how money works, presumably Putin does too. They want the entire flow of cash that's generated by the US economy to go through them. So "richest man in the world" doesn't begin to cover Musk's ambition. He wants "all the money in the world." Forget about any benefit from government, that's over. The health care system would fall apart. The situation with abortion is just the beginning. When Musk says it'll come back better after a few years, that's a lie. Something like that never comes back. We've encountered this before, when the Repubs were threatening default. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132235"></a>Progress on the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/30.html#a170135">YouTube TV</a> front. Thanks to all the responses, I've gotten F*cks News out of the startup position, but it still appears in the upper left corner of the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/31/noMoreFucksNews.png">2-by-2 news multiview display</a>, and thus is the default, and when I launch it I hear them talking which is not pleasant. Further I always have to see what their freaking chyron says, and the commercials from the <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/fact-or-fiction/fact-or-fiction-mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-selling-pillows-for-price-linked-to-nazis-and-white-supremacists">Hitler-fanboi</a> pillow salesman. Basically I want to be able to see what they're doing <i>when I want to,</i> but never have it forced on me. Help. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a132235" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The no-philosophy mess in the Bronx was near-swept by the infidels from California, on their home field no less, so we expect Jankee Estadium to be either haunted in perpetuity or torn down (latter solution preferable) and replaced with something more appropriate, hopefully <i>very</i> far away from Queens, maybe they'd consider moving to California too? Since the Jankees fans only sanction winning, I don't imagine too many would mind if they had to hate them from afar? And now NY baseball is united in our disrespect from the so-called Bronx Bombers, whose bombs were duds this year. Anyway the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/125035.html">Mets did better</a> against the Dodgers in the NLCS, and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani">star hitter</a> wasn't injured when the lovable Metsies played them. The Mets scored far more runs and of course far more philosophy. And in a desperate attempt to win, when losing was already baked-in, two Janks fans were ejected for trying to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/world-series-fan-interference-cd45ba4968dbf6f68b0a6c375a286557">interfere</a> with a Dodger outfielder on a stinking foul ball! I mean if you want to try to steal the game, at least have the good sense to interfere with a home run? Not too smart. Oh well. At least the Janks were humiliated, a bright spot for baseball in the Big Apple. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a132935" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
