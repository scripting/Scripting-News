<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151552"></a>Highly recommend <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trump-will-invoke-alien-enemies-act-to-expel-hispanics/id1633301179?i=1000672975764">today's Olbermann podcast</a>. I've seen video of a recent press interview where Trump said he's use the military to arrest and in some cases kill Americans, starting with but not limited to Hispanics. This is not being reported in the major news orgs. We can't wait for them to fix it, we have to create new channels for news flow that have credibility and work, and we need it before the election. People need at least have a <i>chance</i> of understanding what they are voting for. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/14.html#a151552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
