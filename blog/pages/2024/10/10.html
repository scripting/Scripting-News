<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/10/ronaldMcGrimace.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155959"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/10/ronaldMcGrimace.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Quick note about last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu-LZvntCf8">Mets win over Philly</a>. The series is over, the next game on Sunday will be against the winner in the west, either San Diego or Los Angeles. Last night's game was stressful, low scoring, until the Mets star shortstop hit a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/francisco-lindor-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-center-field-starling-marte-score">freaking</a> <i>grand slam</i> <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/francisco-lindor-sends-mets-to-the-nlcs-eliminates-phillies-with-grand-slam-in-nlds-game-4-035006801.html">home run</a>, and that was all the scoring we needed. The Mets are the hottest team in baseball. It doesn't feel like a long time since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_New_York_Mets_season">2015</a> when they got to the World Series before crashing. Who knows how far we'll get this year, honestly -- I'm surprised (and pleased) we got this far. And in the meantime, I caught a tiny bit of last night's preseason game between the <a href="https://www.bulletsforever.com/2024/10/9/24266653/washington-wizards-new-york-knicks-nba-preseason-game-recap">Knicks</a> and some other team I don't care about. They have two new stars to add to the roster after <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/isaiah-hartenstein-2024-free-agency">losing one star</a> as a free agent, and trading two others for the <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/karl-anthony-towns-trade-knicks-timberwolves">second new star</a>. All in all, very enticing. New York has some excellent sports teams, which is unusual, because it isn't just the Jankees this time, a team I will, I promise, <i>never</i> root for. Quite the opposite. I will root for whoever they are playing. You can probably tell I don't like them. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10.html#a155959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a184350"></a>I'm posting <a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com">development notes</a> on the <i>wordland</i> product in my wordpress/mastodon account. I'm starting to like using the new editor. Today I switched the format we save drafts in from HTML to Markdown. More consistent with my belief that Markdown is the <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html">ideal subset of web writing</a> features for the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10.html#a184350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161705"></a>Isn't it weird that businesses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">work hard</a> to get better position on Google search, but fight the other way with AI to be <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6707fec7-11c8-8012-b616-67bc4c961972">excluded</a>. At some point they could realize that one of the approaches isn't correct. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10.html#a161705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"No kid remembers their best day in front of the TV." In fact I have four memories from my youth, watching TV. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10/190904.html#a190846" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190955"></a>I remember my father rolling around on the floor when the ball went through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18caPNisP2U">Buckner's legs</a>. My father <i>never</i> rolled around on the floor, before or since. But I liked seeing him let go just that once. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10/190904.html#a190955" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191036"></a>Another with my father. When the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenWdylTtzs">Beatles were on Ed Sullivan</a> he said they were wearing wigs. He knew that because no man would actually have hair like that. I was 8 or 9 years old and remember telling him I didn't think he got that right.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10/190904.html#a191036" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191130"></a>I remember exactly where I was when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwZb2mqId0A">Neil Armstrong walked on the moon</a>. At the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a> and about 500 people were watching a tiny TV on top of a VW bus. Somehow everyone could see. It was outdoors and it was silent, everyone was in awe.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10/190904.html#a191130" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191217"></a>One that's only peripherally about TV. I remember every time I went to see a game at Shea Stadium as a kid I was blown away by the color, because most of the Mets games I saw were on TV, in <a href="https://youtu.be/JM0Q-czWSRk?si=vQjJd13u480XleVX&t=36">black and white</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10/190904.html#a191217" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191258"></a>Here's one from adulthood. Watching young Barack Obama give his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEo7lzfpdCU">victory speech</a> on election night in 2008 in my house in Berkeley with a group of friends, with tears running down all our faces.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/10/190904.html#a191258" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
