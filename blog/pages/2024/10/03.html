You could register as an independent blogger, and push your writing up to their cloud in real time. And then readers could ask what experts on <i>whatever</i> think about <i>what just happened</i> and it would know what your expertise is, and it could build the report also in realtime, in response to a very detailed question you could ask. And you could tell it whether or not you want lies, or if they should omit the lies. Personally I would opt out of the lies, but some people like lies in their news, kind of like menthol in cigarettes. And forget about paying the news orgs. They don't give you a way to opt out of the lies. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/03.html#a192131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I may try that again. I've heard it's better at supporting code than other chatbots. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/03.html#a142137" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153502"></a>Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think about it. That's not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that didn't have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without television, and I didn't use a computer until I was 18 or use the web until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/03/152757.html#a153502" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153247"></a>If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has been stretched before and I'm well educated and in my work have explored frontiers of knowledge, even so -- this is the most mind-stretching experience I've ever had. Not kidding. And I'm not a VC or prone to overhyping tech.
