They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice. (Update: <a href="https://x.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1798365545106141236">Jay is on it</a>.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/05.html#a151218" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He is not an authority on democracy, he's one of the early pariahs. There has been no apology, or regret expressed. As bad as Alito. I wonder if CNN has bothered to check how people feel about him.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/05.html#a151023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
