Every time I asked it to fix a problem, it created another problem, and the image brightness was reduced, not just in terms of pixels but also the creativity of the image. Of course it isn't really creative. I know. Yadda yadda. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/25/134922.html#a134947" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
