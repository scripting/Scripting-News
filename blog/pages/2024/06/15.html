<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131418"></a>I have a server that's returning <a href="https://opml.org/">OPML</a> files. It's not the first time I've done this, but now there seem to be enough other people interested in this that it's worth raising this question. What content type should I use. Generally I've been using text/xml. But I see other people using text/opml. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opml.org/issues/20">thread</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/15.html#a131418" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130559"></a>One place I could use ChatGPT-like functionality, in debugging CSS. I'd like to put my cursor on an object in Elements view and ask why does this object have a width of 1054.09px. When I look it up in the Computed panel it's greyed out, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to get the debugger to explain this. But there is an answer to this question. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/15.html#a130559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'd like to put up a page with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/14/175200.html">yesterday's ad</a>, and let people put up money to run it.
