<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132537"></a>Is this the <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1800879295063003367">user experience</a> writers want from WordPress? If I were designing it, I would start from scratch, build an easy writing tool for writers to focus on writing, make the design process accessible if they want to work in that mode, but keep it out of their way because most writing has nothing to do with design.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/12.html#a132537" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162334"></a>A simple <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/44dbe62f-6bac-4b08-880d-91822be0d6c7">example</a> where ChatGPT saves programmer time. MySQL has awful error messages. Rather than try to figure out what they mean, I paste the message into ChatGPT and say nothing. It tells me what the error was and even fixes it for me. I copy the result, paste it into MySQL and I'm back on the road. One can imagine where they build that into the MySQL app and I converse with it instead of the app with the awful error messages. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/12.html#a162334" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
