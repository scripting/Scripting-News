<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133741"></a>Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent <a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a>? That's the kind of bullshit Google does. We don't do that in the open formats and protocols world. What really pains me is they claim to follow <a href="https://this.how/standards/">my</a> Rules for Standards-makers. Imho they do not. Two rules apply. <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000">Rule #1</a> says the only reason we do this is interop. It's called Rule #1 for a reason. And the <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way</a> rule a little further down the page. I've seen this happen twice where people say they abide by the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">RFSM</a> but then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the name you've chosen. We've been down this path. The only way it ends is in <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/134901.html?title=standardsKitty">tears</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20.html#a133741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133225"></a>Now that I'm publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in commercial podcast clients, I'm learning for the first time how they work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that would have worked if I hadn't made a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601">mistake</a> in GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say "Hey readers dump your cache now, let's start over, because I fcuked up." It wouldn't have mattered anyway, I'm sure none of them would listen, right? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20.html#a133225" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115837"></a>ChatGPT is the Ozempic of online info-finding. Neither is a panacea, there are side-effects, but both make possible great feats that weren't possible before, and both have come about just in the last year or two.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20.html#a115837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/112648820680722618">wondering</a> if there are any services set up to make this easy.

Even worse, none of it, even in the short term, made much of a difference. ðŸ˜‚Threads API reminds me wh<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20.html#a111832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115050"></a>I started to write the code to hook up my linkblogger to Threads, but it led me to the same website with all my broken Facebook apps, the ones that stopped working when they shut down the API after the 2016 election. A reminder that this is still Facebook. And while I don't blame them for shutting down the APIs, the whole experience left a really bad feeling. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/115039.html#a115050" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

The kitten has a surprised and concerned expression as she looks at the developer site on another screen, which shows a Facebook logo and reminds her of the events of 2016. In the background, a calendar shows the year 2024. The scene is set in a cozy room with soft lighting and a few toys scattered around, giving it a homely feel.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/115039.html#a115156" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
