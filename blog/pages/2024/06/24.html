But I just learned that UTM might work. Here’s the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/38d87439-9a34-402d-9c46-7a047e7e2866">transcript</a> of my inquiry. Wondering if <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/112671088952473981">anyone has had good experience</a> using UTM to run older Mac software on Apple CPUs.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/24.html#a123002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Big surprise they say pretty much exactly what they say on the news about the candidates, all of it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance#:~:text=False%20balance%2C%20known%20colloquially%20as,viewpoints%20than%20the%20evidence%20supports.">bothsidesisms</a> and no mention of the fascism coming our way if we go one direction. It's all everyone's fault, so why bother voting, is mostly what they say. SMH in disbelief.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/24.html#a152539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Please listen to the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a">14-minute podcast</a> I <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23.html#a201841">posted</a> yesterday for the real story. We should learn from this and not repeat the same mistake, and of course until the real story is out, we can't learn from it. Let's get it right on the Wikipedia page. It isn't about Guha or Libby, me, or whoever. It's really about the power of Netscape and the early web news publishing companies that supported RSS, and the blogging systems that jumped on board (including my own products) and then two years later, the NYT coming on board, followed by the entire news industry. A bunch of nerds arguing on a mail list is <i>not</i> the story. With the benefit of well over twenty years hindsight this should, by now, be kind of obvious. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/24.html#a123814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123121"></a><a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C8mUXGiMODB">Threads could</a> make it a lot easier for us to cross-post to their system, esp since they say they will support ActivityPub. As it is there are too many hoops to jump through imho. I think basically they all want you to use their UI's which amounts to writing in <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little textboxes</a> of course. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/24.html#a123121" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
