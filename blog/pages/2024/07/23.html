<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/23/hopeKamala.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122650"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/23/hopeKamala.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I was able to follow <a href="https://x.com/kamalahq">kamalhq</a> on twitter. This <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lover-elon-musk-already-145940678.html">report</a> says that Musk is rate-limiting followers on that account.  Of course we <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">warned</a> what could happen if a Republican bought twitter, but I didn't honestly contemplate that a fascist would. These days our greatest fears aren't scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh. BTW, if you want to know why we're so thrilled to have Harris as the candidate, even though we didn't want Joe to give in, it's because no informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it). Today it's the hope that we won't be deported or worse.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23.html#a122650" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133302"></a>All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem what they have to say about that. But the reporter <i>knows</i> what the Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don't care if we know.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23.html#a133302" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130134"></a>A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a">podcast</a>, started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what we put on the wire over the social web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a130134" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130240"></a>Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from algol-like and lisp-like. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a130240" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130536"></a>I talk about what made Unix so great. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a130536" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131158"></a>Eric Raymond once told me that <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is <a href="http://reallysimple.org/">RSS</a> and the rest. Huge compliment because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a131158" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130632"></a>Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the big picture. We shouldn't give them so much power, they pretend they know, but they are usually pretty clueless. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a130632" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130804"></a>This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours every day, and string those days together. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a130804" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130900"></a>I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt. Those are the hardest projects, I'm doing one of those right now, but in the end it's worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/23/130117.html#a130900" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
