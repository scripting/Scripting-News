People can link to my posts, but not attach themselves to my flow. Goodbye spam and the motive for abuse, attention. Something I'd like to try someday, but first you need people who are interested. It's a chicken and egg thing.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/06.html#a180323" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Obama had Hillary. Hillary had Bernie. Gore had Nader. Bill Clinton had Perot. I guess Mondale and Dukakis unified the party? Before that, Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter, that was something. open war. Probably we'll all be wishing for Joe Biden if you all succeed at getting him to resign. BTW he's just one person, there's a limit to how much <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a> one person can absorb.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/06.html#a174424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135642"></a>I cancelled my NYT subscription. They can't hear their readers. It's time for a new journalism, and we're going to have to do it without them. I haven't cancelled my Washington Post subscription yet, but I'm pretty sure that's coming soon enough.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/06.html#a135642" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
