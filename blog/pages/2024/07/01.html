<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200300"></a>Our challenge is to make sure the really interesting stuff happens on the open web, outside the silos. If that happens we can go on. Otherwise we go right back to where we were when Twitter and Facebook dominated. Not a good place. 17 years of stagnation<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01.html#a200300" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You can now go directly to the OPML version of a blogroll, and to the HTML page we discovered it in. I know all this must seem strange, hard to figure out what's going on. That's how I feel about it too. But I know there's interesting data here, how people are connected to people. I'm still trying to figure out how to make a browser that engages the mind in that. It can take a long time to figure these things out. I had the basic idea for a blog in 1994, but it wasn't until 1999 that we really had it figured out and implemented for non-techies. This may be like that, or the browser might be just around the corner.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01.html#a125504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195427"></a>We talk about how to organize news for people who are information starved by whatever it is that our news sources are doing, which is really hard to figure out, but in the end (I argue) who cares why, we have a problem to solve, so let's get on with it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/195344.html#a195427" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195515"></a>I talk about the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, that's how they got around journalism. I'm sure that's where we have to go, put together what we think would be the Biden blog if the campaign was being run by Joe and Nicco, and I'd be on board, so would Jeff, and we'd help Heather Cox Richardson, and amplify anyone who is making sense and supports democracy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/195344.html#a195515" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

It wouldn't take very much money, it's just a blog. But it would have powerful ideas that cut through the bullshit, and great videos, and we'd organize marches where people show up to help people.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/195344.html#a195658" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
