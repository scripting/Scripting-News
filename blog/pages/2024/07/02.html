I was cheering out loud during the first segment. When you read this <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C864lCsuwbK">post</a>, you'll see why. I tried listening to the NYT Daily podcast today, but it made me hate them all over again, starting with saying how great a week it has been for Trump. You can say that, imho, but you have to say right after that, that it was a terrible week for the rest of us. Because any good news for Trump is awful news for everyone else. And I do mean everyone, including the people who plan to vote for him again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/02.html#a150249" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's got a really nice taste. Went to the store today, they only had one 12-pack, but they also had a 12-pack of <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/coca-cola/products/coca-cola-spiced">Coke Spiced Zero</a>. I decided to give it a try. I had a can at lunch and it's weird but okay I guess, but the belches are strongly flavored and that's <i>realllly</i> weird. It took me a while to figure out where this <a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a32925734/why-do-my-burps-smell/">belch-breath</a> was coming from. It tastes like I took some very strong medicine. The weirdest soft drink I've ever had. But it kind of grows on you. I'll try another one and let you know how it goes.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/02.html#a215018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"I turned off comments here. I didn't want to have a discussion about this, it's just an observation." I think this is totally legit and more people should do it.
