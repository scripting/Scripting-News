You've been heard. This is the President of the United States. If you don't respect the man at least respect the office. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/05.html#a001531" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140802"></a>This year I'm thinking how we can boot up a source of news that has the balance we deserve. Now that the Supreme Court is no longer keeping up any pretense of respecting the Constitution, and journalism is either colluding, or preparing for their meeting with a military tribunal in March next year, followed by, if lucky, a re-education camp, we need help knowing what's real and what's <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a">not</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/05.html#a140802" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141207"></a>I hear that cancelling a NYT subscription is wicked hard. That <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a">alone</a> makes me feel like cancelling. I cancelled their morning email of things I need to know about. It's one thing for them to exclusively report on Biden's age in their space, but my mailbox is mine. Get the F out of my mailbox. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/05.html#a141207" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
