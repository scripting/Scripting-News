I'm watching the news like everyone else after President Biden withdrew. There really is a lot happening very quickly, and the Dems all sound like they got their story straight, for once the Dems sound like a party. How did that happen. NakedJen says we need a miracle. I said that's her department. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/21.html#a212256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They're driving us into the arms of the Nazis. Who knows why, or even if there is a reason, other than their drive to find meaning in their great wealth. Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the money they've accumulated. These are not human-size fortunes, playing a game of make-believe, what if we really were as smart as we think our money says we are. Well you ain't that smart.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/21/212648.html#a154803" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
