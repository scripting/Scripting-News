<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200442"></a>We're at a huge fork in the road. One fork -- goodbye USA, the other way, we're stronger than ever. We're in a good spot because Trump's tank is empty. He's old, tired, fat, addled, fetid, rotten. You have to work really hard not to see that. If it works, Biden will have stabilized the country, and Harris will erect the guardrails that make sure no one follows in Trump's path, and the Supreme Court gets back into its proper place. They've been overthrowing our society, economy and political system. That all has to be reversed before it does too much damage, and prevented in the future. I want to know why the court can't be expanded, and if Harris will put that in her platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html#a200442" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190304"></a>It's weird that JD Vance goes out with the insults before most people have any idea who he is. Instead of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3pz2pz8no">childless cat ladies</a> sticking to Kamala, it's sticking to him, which I'm pretty sure wasn't his intent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html#a190304" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190245"></a>Pretty remarkable how abusive the bots on Twitter have become. Makes discourse there seem pretty silly.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191605"></a>I want a Masto-clone that does not do replies. You can't insert anything under my idea, but you can if you like include my idea, as a link, in yours. This model works. I think by now we know the other way does not work. BTW I use the term Masto-clone interchangeably with Twitter-like. Let's spread the love around. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html#a191605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192311"></a>Software-wise I realized recently that everything that takes me away from creating really nice writing and publishing tools is a waste. I have to get off track because there are huge holes in the web as a runtime platform. And every year it gets worse as new incompatible languages are added, new incompatible stacks built. As a result we have to re-do everything all the time, and never get a chance to create new user experience. The market fragments, which is exactly what the tech companies want. It keeps their products from becoming commodities. And like it or not, the politicians and corporations don't want us writing too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about things they don't care about. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html#a192311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
