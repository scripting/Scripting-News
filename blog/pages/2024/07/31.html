What if the child doesn't live up to their expectations? Creating a new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that's</i> an accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a functioning reproductive system. It's not anything to be proud or to expect to be rewarded or respected for.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31.html#a135556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If you supported outbound RSS, I could use your system as a note-taking tool. I know Bluesky does, and I should use it that way, but these days I'm more drawn to Threads, even though I know it's really Facebook under the covers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31.html#a144100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142738"></a>In the context of who we are as a country, and what the Repubs do and say about the country, "weird" is pretty mild. What word would you prefer the Democrats use? Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, writing that column. (Safire was a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a> btw.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/142559.html#a142738" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142838"></a>And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term. This is where you get to speak out about what they're doing over there, and how it's not journalism. One of the rare things we agree with Trump on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/142559.html#a142838" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
