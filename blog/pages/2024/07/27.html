You see the stories long before home page play or tweets. Gave me an edge.

For both, I did the interview with Natasha Celine of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040804051308/http://pacificviews.org/">Pacific Views blog</a>. The next 2004 podcast won't be until <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/08/15.html">August 15</a>. Banter with Adam Curry and Steve Gillmor probably about the podcasting bootstrap which at this point appears to be underway. Not sure if anyone as ever gone down this path in the last 20 years because, when I do the searches to find links to sites and people, I don't see any mention of this stuff in the current day, although now there will be (here in my blog archive). Here's <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">the feed</a> of ancient podcast review. You can find the reverse chronologic list of the whole series on <a href="https://morningcoffeenotes.com/">morningcoffeenotes.com</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/27.html#a141029" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's the deal. When I write a blog post and want to know if anyone has mentioned it, I will simply be able to ask ChatGPT, "Have any sites mentioned, with or without links, the story I wrote yesterday entitled "Unix-like things" and if so please provide a title, synopsis and link, if available, so I can read the full text." I'm sure that will be appropriately shortened, or perhaps turned into something like the referrer lists of today. Something the network can do for us automatically. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/27.html#a142019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They want to be in a search engine index (that's called SEO) where they want to be paid to be part of a chatbot. There really isn't a line there, in fact. That's what SearchGPT makes obvious. I for one, want all my stuff in their index so I can find out wtf I've been writing about here for almost 30 freaking years! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/27.html#a142540" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
