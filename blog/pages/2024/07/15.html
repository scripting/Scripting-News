He hasn't done anything to tell us who he is in that dimension. To the extent that we do know anything about him: 1. He's a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/george-clooney-reveals-hilarious-pranks-hes-pulled-while-pretending-to-be-brad-pitt-and-bill-clinton-063025071.html">prankster</a>. 2. He has a brilliant and beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney">wife</a>. 3. He has a huge <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/entertainment/a45302334/george-clooney-not-selling-lake-como-villa/">mansion</a> in Italy which he keeps very private. 4. He's <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a44752794/george-clooney-net-worth/">rich</a>. We have nothing in common. He should run for office and get in the mix. The fact that the NYT chose him, that says something about them, they don't care what people think, or they think we're really shallow and will fall for bullshit like George Clooney. He loves Biden. We didn't even know he knew Joe Biden! Why should Clooney have more of a say in this than I do? Tell me what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> thinks, or Al Sharpton. Or give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore">Michael Moore</a> a shot. He has a lot more skin in the game than Clooney. I'd love to read an op-ed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frum">David Frum</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney">Liz Cheney</a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22elie+mystal%22">Elie Mystal</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a130217" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124845"></a><i>We. Need. To. Organize.</i> Democrats should roll out new initiatives with the same skill as Apple rolls out new products. Not the same as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Steve+Jobs%22">Steve Jobs</a>, that's asking too much. But with focus and showmanship, and a livestream, and fanbois and Al Sharpton in place of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber">John Gruber</a>. Focus our attention on each product (ie climate change, social security, Ukraine, etc), so the ideas don't get missed, and we can network in support of the initiative. This is all part of the idea of having a <i>democratic.party</i> website that we call call home for our political organizing. None of this pissing in the wind we do on twitter-like systems. Form buddy groups of people we organize with, based on locality or common interests. Organize the people as well as the billionaires are organized. This is what political parties should be in 2024 for crying out loud. We're missing the point of the mess in our politics. It's all a mess because it needs to be organized and it's not. Maybe I should take everything else off my blog now so I can use what little attention I have been able to gather here to focus on this idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

On the other hand, some portion of the 15,000 reporters at the DNC will be trying to figure out what we, the bloggers, are doing at the DNC. I suspect most of them will conclude that we don't belong there, in the same way most of the early articles about weblogs concluded we are not going to kill professional journalism."
