<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222615"></a>I had a post here about the inevitability of Biden stepping aside, then I turned on the news and saw how the press was humiliating the President at a meeting with the president of Ukraine. We can't give into this. How dare they insult the president as he represents the US in NATO. I can't get behind this. We're in a bad bad place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/11.html#a222615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I just listened to <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/coffeeNotesJuly11.mp3">the show</a> from this day 20 years ago. It was quite a throwback, lots of questions about what I was talking about, I've forgotten a lot of it. It took a full hour to prepare the feed. I can tell this is going to be quite a flashback experience. Maybe it'll get me in the mode to do some serious innovating, because we were on fire and didn't know it, in so many ways, back in the summer of 2004.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/11.html#a135750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
