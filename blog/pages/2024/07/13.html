	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192107"></a>let's organize democratic voters. the better organized we are, the better we can get through the attacks from the nyt, cnn, msnbc, et al that are coming until the election. a web site for circles of friends, a buddy system that gets the word out. can use all social networks, email etc. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/13/191953.html#a192107" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192126"></a>encourage biden to take off the gloves, even more than he is. he should say the biggest problem is the supreme court. we have to fix it. make this a referendum on roe v wade and all the other stuff that's harder to explain.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/13/191953.html#a192126" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192129"></a>level with people. biden isn't the best speech-maker and 81-year-olds can't run around like they're 50 (he's still figuring that out),  but he's a really good president. think about how it was when trump turned things over. the country was in really bad shape. he totally blew covid. that mattered. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/13/191953.html#a192129" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192923"></a>one more thing -- trump attacked the freaking capitol on his way out. that man has a temper and is a loser. a sore loser <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/13/191953.html#a192923" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192131"></a>biden has friends who help him. make the theme song for the election <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C58ttB2-Qg">help from my friends</a> by the beatles. put the young stars of the democrats out on the road and sell them as the future that we are working on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/13/191953.html#a192131" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192149"></a>the product isn’t just Biden, it’s a freaking goverment and social security, and owning your own body, freedom of religion, all that good american stuff. It’s the governors of pennsylvania, michigan, arizona, the senators from georgia, it’s the whole freaking thing!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/13/191953.html#a192149" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192216"></a>like it or not the debate <i>did</i> start the campaign. Everyone is listening to Joe Jobs now, so say things! Dont waste the attention.
