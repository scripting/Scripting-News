I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a> is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to "just happen" organically. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/17.html#a135505" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
