I started out that way 40+ years ago, and somewhere along the line I stopped thinking that way. If you can, watch <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-bear/video-extras/video/64beaaa830c49e0001e758d8">S02 E07</a> to see what I mean. It's about service, the connection between the staff and the people who come to eat, and the medium is the food. It's the same idea. There's so much cynicism around tech, and I hate that. We've rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians. But it should be much more than that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/16.html#a230435" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195217"></a>Has it ever been suggested that journalists take an oath, similar to the one <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/">the President takes</a> to: "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." Could be voluntary. Sports reporters might take a different oath.

I was in Seattle, Adam was coming from Belgium. Haven't written any notes about it yet. If others are interested in listening and commenting on these podcasts, this is when it was all coming together, let me know and perhaps we can start a thread on Mastodon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/16.html#a133336" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135614"></a>The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140522"></a>This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds page</a> is where you set it up. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png">Screen shot</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/16/135141.html#a140522" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
