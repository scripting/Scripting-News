What you see when you go to scripting.com. I'm putting the same kind of attention into it that I did for the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html">blogroll</a> feed reader earlier this year. There are a few unreleased products that use the same approach. The way we read the web hasn't received enough attention, we've been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces, forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We've settled for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well. I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I'm saving that for a big reveal at some point. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/29.html#a152704" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This how we created solid interop in the blogging world, and it would work here too.

Not a huge deal but every little bit helps.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/29.html#a003937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
