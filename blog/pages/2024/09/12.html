<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213129"></a>Just watched a Harris rally in Charlotte NC. She's using what Trump said in the debate in her new campaign speech. Brilliant. Getting him on the record in that context is a gift. 60 million viewers. Up till then he only took interviews where he could bully his way past the interviewer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12.html#a213129" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

A couple of months ago, I was practically begging him to do this. He was pouring so much unfocused energy into making journalism play an appropriate role in our democracy. When Jeff started posting to his blog, it gave his friends something to point to. This writing had much more impact than a random tweet. Journalism crossed a line they should not have crossed. Now we fully expect them to try to do it again. We have to find a way for our ideas not to be scattered in the wind, so thorougly ignorable. And in doing so, I'm convinced we'd find a better way to organize the electorate online so it's more immune from unwise and unfair manipulation from the journalists. At the same time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a>, who was also scattering his ideas about, has started a <a href="https://cornerstone.ghost.io/">newsletter</a>. Dan was a real blogging <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22dan+gillmor%22">pioneer</a> as was Jeff. We remember how this kind of thing boots up. We can set up any kind of distribution system we need. What matters is the collection of brilliance. Individuals are not so powerful unless they come from one of these. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12.html#a123813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's a former local reporter in South Carolina. I met him on a road tour I did a bunch of years ago. Where does he post this stuff? Facebook. I want it to be part of the concentrated web writers union. Maybe think of it as my <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/01/143422.html?title=iWantMyKarass">karass</a>, my version of The Atlantic, perhaps. Or my version of the op-ed page of the NY Times. I think there is definitely enough good stuff out there, unorganized, to easily rival them for originality, depth of thought, experience and great writing. Dan is on my list of such superheroes.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12.html#a125813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130253"></a>And btw I also am wasting my ideas too, one in a hundred has any influence, and even then it's minscule, the ideas drift away unimplemented or unused. I keep writing, hoping I see a way to get into the global conversation, again. I remember what it's like. But I'm not done. We still have a big problem to solve in our political and communication system. Online software is where it's at. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12.html#a130253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

A campaign would be a season. There would be character development, arcs, twists, revelations, unforseen events, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/11/politics/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement/index.html">cameos</a>, acts of god. Near the end of the season you have the election, with the following episodes the plotting, intrigue, and undermining of democracy, and at the end of the season the inauguration of a new president. Each year you have more michegas, until four years later you go through the election all over again. People would really study the candidates, and would have reasons they like one character over another. And maybe the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYqqW3c2mBU">patriarch</a> doesn't die, and decides to run again. This is where we're heading, we might already be there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12.html#a123319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213403"></a><i>I was trying to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/113125134990424609">explain</a> to Miguel de Icaza, a longtime developer friend, how Dropbox was within inches of making the web a million times more useful, ten years ago, and then backed away from it. I don't think I've ever told the story here on my blog, so here goes. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213403" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213644"></a>In 2014, Dropbox had a developer program, you could write an app, and register it with them, and then the user could run your app from a website, and log on to Dropbox in the app, and they would have access to files in a directory in the user's Dropbox hierarchy in the app, as if it were accessing it from the local file system, which in a way they were.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213644" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213651"></a>I made an <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">outliner</a> for that system, and loved it -- it was great, I didn't have to get into the business of reselling storage, or user identity. And for the users, it "just worked" as they say, because they were already using Dropbox, and now it could be used for something completely new and incredibly useful, and it didn't require huge venture capital to get it going, so it would enable very small niche products to find a market. It was brilliant and visionary, and I was very open about my feelings on my blog. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213651" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213828"></a>They also had a Public Folder, where any user files could be accessed over the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213828" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214319"></a>They were within an inch of the perfect system. The problem was my app couldn't access user files in any other directory. So it didn't allow for specialization in products, every editor had to do everything. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a214319" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213843"></a>They had an option where you could give an app access to <i>everything</i> but that was ridiculous, I couldn't recommend users do that. Users store all kinds of private data on Dropbox.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213843" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213905"></a>Here's the <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/fargo/dropbox.html">howto</a> for the product and how it connects to Dropbox.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213905" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>They lost interest in this, btw -- and when they broke the API, I took that opportunity to shut down the product. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213930"></a>I wish they had gone in that direction, or someone would go in that direction. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/12/213354.html#a213930" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
