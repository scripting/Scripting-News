It's a <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_9_pro_phone_case">case</a> for the new <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_9_pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. It shipped 17 days go. It was hell to just tell Google that the case was lost. I expected at that point they'd apologize and refund the money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return the case when it arrives. It's never going to arrive. Luckily this is a cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1300 phone, that would be a pretty big problem. It's amazing that a company the size and age of Google doesn't have a procedure for dealing with products that are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I've been through this with Amazon, they knew what to do, because UPS does lose packages, esp ones that look like they have phones in them. Anyway I have a fairly large credit with Google. I don't dare use it to purchase anything else, given how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer problems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/23.html#a185701" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
