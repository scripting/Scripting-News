These were the good days, a new medium in its early stages of booting up, after years of trying to get it to go. In the next few weeks, it'll really start going.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142904"></a>I also added a link to the RSS feed in each shownotes page. In the HTML at the bottom, as a white on orange icon and in the <a href="view-source:https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/07/27/interviewWithDonMeansOfMeetup.html">page source</a> as a &lt;link> element.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/13.html#a142904" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143240"></a>I keep seeing mention of "Podcast 2.0" in various places. That is unusually greedy, even for the tech industry. What next? Deprecating the way podcasting has worked for the last 20 years? How do we know the people doing this aren't shilling for Spotify, Google or Amazon? Please don't mess with something that works as well as podcasting. You want to do something better, great -- make your own name and get people to respect it. Stealing respect from podcasting tells me you have no honor or self-respect, and it should say the same to everyone else. Something else that tells you it's bad, they never bothered to send me an email. Welcome to the tech industry. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/13.html#a143240" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
