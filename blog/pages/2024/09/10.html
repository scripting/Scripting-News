He started on the Mets in their inaugural year, 1962. They went from the worst team ever to World Champions in record time. They became the heroes of NYC in 1969. I was riding the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Flushing,+NY+11358/The+Bronx+High+School+of+Science,+West+205th+Street,+The+Bronx,+NY/@40.8244197,-73.952697,12z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f39fba19f047:0x456fa7ab9f9bae18!2m2!1d-73.8913029!2d40.8779204!3e3!5i4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">subway</a> back then to get from Flushing to the Bronx to go to school, and in the Bronx, when the Mets won, everyone was smiling. If you've ever been to NYC you know how unusual that is. And in the Bronx, which is of course where the always-hated Yankees were HQ'd. Ed Kranepool <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/sports/no-one-a-met-more-through-and-through-than-ed-kranepool/">died</a> Sunday. He was watching a Mets game when he had a heart attack. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/10.html#a113403" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Then came "childless cat ladies" and now cats being eaten in Ohio. Either I was prescient, or the Trumps are copying me! Anyway, here's the Wordle Kitty $5 postage stamp, next in the series. She just broke out of prison to rescue the Ohio cats from JD Lance.

Answer every question with one of your major positioning statements. Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts, whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being heard <i>all the time</i> was his biggest sin. Harris should get accustomed to being accessible when she's in office. Keep the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/">kamalahq</a> snark channel going. This will have been Trump's contribution to American politics, no fear of being heard. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/10/162001.html#a152324" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
