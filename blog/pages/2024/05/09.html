That's a bridge too far for many people. In other words, your understanding of feeds (RSS, Atom, etc) can be of service to others. And by collecting useful sources of news, maybe even insightful ones, we can help upgrade the quality of news we all get. The first step is to learn how to use FeedLand, and <a href="https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md">it's pretty easy</a>, esp if you already understand feeds. And with categories and OPML subscription lists, you can organize your feed reading everywhere, not just in FeedLand.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/09.html#a151859" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I used to use StackExchange all the time, now I never do, ChatGPT is much better. There's a lot of anxiety out there, it seems but this is like shutting the barn door after the horse has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close_the_stable_door_after_the_horse_has_bolted">bolted</a>. There was a time when StackExchange was a godsend for programmers. But that time has passed. Here's a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174">demo</a>. I was trying to figure out why some ancient code wasn't working. I never understood how it worked, and now I had to figure out what was going wrong. So I debugged it, carefully, step by step, with ChatGPT. It's as if I was working with another programmer who had read and fully understood every StackExchange message, and was willing to work with me for no pay to get to the bottom of the problem. This is what we call disruption. It's a whole new level of programming.
