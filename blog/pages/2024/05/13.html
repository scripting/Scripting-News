<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204138"></a>I've been trying the new 4o version of ChatGPT. It's much faster. It certainly is a search engine. And it covers news. I asked it about Michael Cohen's testimony today in the Trump trial, and it gave me a summary. I asked for the weather forecast in Kingston NY. It wouldn't give me the lyrics to Martha My Dear by the Beatles. I asked it to draw a weather map of the mid-Atlantic states, but it drew the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/13/205122.html">usual garbage</a> for technical images. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/13.html#a204138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

No more hunting through menus to not find the setting where you’re sure it should be.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130409"></a>Here's where we're headed now that we have AI programming partners. Creating software will be possible the way popular music is created. Watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">Get Back</a> to get an idea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">George Martin</a> was the Beatles sherpa, the same way my AI partner is my guide through unknown programming lands. It now doesn't matter if I have less experience building MySQL apps than others. I have the collective experience of <i>all of them</i> here to help. My George Martin. What got me thinking about this is John Naughton's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/11/chatgpt-ai-will-co-pilot-coders-to-new-heights-of-creativity?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">piece</a> about AI and programming. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/13.html#a130409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131145"></a>BTW, that's what <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/13/myBlogroll.png?nodialog">my blogroll</a> is turning into. My contributors. The people I keep an eye on through my work day. Where I get new ways of looking at the same world we're all looking at.

The headline in the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/12/pacers-blow-out-knicks-tie-series/">Daily News</a> reads "Pacers blow depleted, dead-legged Knicks out of the water in Game 4, tie series 2-2." Yeah. I don't know how we recover from this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. "It's been a great season, but we're tired. We're headed to the beach, we'll see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support." I would nod my head and say "Yeah that makes sense." Whatever. I may spend today sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for sure, and yes, I will watch.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/13.html#a120359" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
