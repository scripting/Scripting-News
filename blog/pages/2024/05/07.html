<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/08/17/doctorNick.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115159"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/08/17/doctorNick.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I said this to a friend recently, in an email: â€œI noticed a change with the doctors, where earlier they would dismiss my fears of having this or that fatal disease, now they're always looking for the thing that's going to kill me.â€œ The friend, a retired English professor, said the sentence was very effective. Part of me would like to send the sentence and the review to my freshman English professor, I think she would be proud. Instead I decided to blog it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/07.html#a115159" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115333"></a>BTW, I was struck that famous editor and writer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@semaforben@threads.net">Ben Smith</a> said he was ashamed at starting out as a blogger, on an MSNBC show hosted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough">true hack</a>. The quote was from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who like me, <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303">cross-posts</a> to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051">found</a> it. My comment: "I didnâ€™t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. Whatâ€™s wrong with people?" Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/07.html#a115333" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
