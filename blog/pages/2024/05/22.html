<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125735"></a>I'm going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a> for the third time. One of the major themes of the show is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons">robots</a> that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/22.html#a125735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131318"></a>Has anyone ever asked you, on the social web, what you think about something? Not a message to everyone to which you could reply, but a message specifically to you? I try to do it when I think of it. I find you can get really interesting ideas that way sometimes. And also it's a way spreading some love around the world, because people like to be asked what they think, I've found.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/22.html#a131318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123424"></a>I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks. I knew all the players. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin">Obi Toppin</a>, a former Knick we traded for some reason. That's about it for my inner fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result when I got up in the morning. That's how I like my NBA, frankly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/22.html#a123424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
