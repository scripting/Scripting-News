<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a230238"></a>Every social web should offer the two same author-level moderation controls that Facebook does. 1. The author can delete comments. 2. The author can say who can respond. Here are screen shots of the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/whoCanComment1.png">menu</a> and <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/whoCanComment2.png">dialog</a>. We assume each site already has the ability to block users. No more spammer trolls.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/12.html#a230238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/librarian.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143142"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/librarian.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">ChatGPT is like a worldwide encyclopedia that comes with a free librarian, 24 hours a day, who never gets tired and thinks all your questions are super insightful. I suppose everyone projects their ideal best friend on this thing. You just learned something about me. Heh. But the cool thing is it's not a yes-person, if they think you're wrong they say so. Which I <i>really</i> like. One more thing I'm really glad I got to be alive when this stuff came online. I feel much smarter and better organized and it's harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive assistant. Takes notes on what I'm doing and figures out what I need to be reminded of and roughly when. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/12.html#a143142" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Yesterday's one sentence <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their executive editor in a recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>, who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/12.html#a115836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
