I usually write my prompts very carefully, esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring, and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was repetetive and had an error I didn't bother to correct, to see what would happen. It didn't even criticize me. It figured out what I was trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep finding miracles in this tech.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06.html#a134032" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135954"></a>I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called "legacy." The app that uses that feature doesn't work.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140303"></a>I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140351"></a>One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140351" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140447"></a>I'd love to see one of these support the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140447" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
