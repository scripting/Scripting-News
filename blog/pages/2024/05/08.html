I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134">Voice Memo app</a> to take notes while I'm programming. Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an <i>edited</i> version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end). I understand that <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/">$AAPL</a> is depressed because the lack of an <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html">AI story</a>. Here's a use that every stock trader will understand immediately. Huge value. I'm sure others are doing it. But Apple has the high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I've owned a bunch of Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and I'm right.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/08.html#a143605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135612"></a>Now that I have my <a href="http://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> as a regular feature in <a href="http://scripting.com/">my blog</a>, I am able to keep current with more bloggers. It's actually much more than a blogroll, it's a feed reader. When a feed that I'm following updates, it moves to the top of the list. And if I want to <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/08/blogrollscreenshot.png">see what's new</a>, I just click on the wedge next to its name to reveal the most recent five posts. From there, I can get to the full post by clicking on the permalink. If you want to get a feel for it without taking the plunge yourself, you can leave my blog open in a browser tab. You'll get exactly what I get.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/08.html#a135612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
