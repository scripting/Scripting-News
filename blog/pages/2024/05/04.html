<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142738"></a>ChatGPT is letting us customize the context in which our queries run. So I can say I use JavaScript so if I ask a programming question, it should answer in that language. I was happy to have this feature, and gave it a thumbs up. The idea is that we build up a highly detailed profile over time, so ChatGPT gets better at answering my questions. And it also locks us in. It didn't come up for me until Meta.ai came along and sometimes it's good to get a second opinion. But I want to share that profile info. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/04.html#a142738" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134626"></a>In the other big Eastern Division game on Thursday, why did Doc Rivers, the Milwaukee Bucks' coach go into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_time">garbage time</a> when the Bucks were down by only 10 with 2.5 minutes remaining? What the frack was he thinking? Deficits like that are often made up, esp in elimination games? Being a good sport is one thing, but quitting the season early when you're only down by 10? What the what? I tuned in the game at the point when his stars were coming out, before the Knicks game started, and couldn't figure out why he was giving up so soon?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/04/134004.html#a134626" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
