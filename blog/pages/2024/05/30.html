It's the people that get this stuff right. Juries are <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html">wonderful</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/30.html#a014120" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143314"></a>BTW, I've noticed that Google often doesn't link to the Wikipedia page unless you specifically ask for it. I don't like that. I think it should always be at the top. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/30.html#a143314" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125832"></a>The best humor is about other people being stupid, evil, clumsy or their misfortune. Watch a SNL skit. It's not about people being smart or brave, kind, generous or otherwise wonderful. That's another kind of entertainment. We find the misfortune of others funny. Especially famous, successful people. Why? I have no idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/30.html#a125832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Biden is a fine LBJ-like president. And like LBJ, he has his Vietnam. Biden's war he can't end is called Trump. Trump isn't in jail.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163447"></a>The problem could be fixed if we had this discussion out in the open, so that the press raises it every day and in every press event. They shouldn't be trying to embarrass him about his age, that's rude and deceptive, instead they should ask why isn't Trump in jail?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/30/134935.html#a163447" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135731"></a>Biden's number one promise is that he will <i>fully</i> prosecute Trump and all insurrectionists in his second term, starting now. This would also serve as a warning to any Trump supporters that tried to overthrow the government (again, sigh) before or during the election. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/30/134935.html#a135731" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135926"></a>People who think Trump is losing don't get it. People are rightly fed up with Biden. But not for the economy. That's bullshit. And not because he's old. Rather because he's selling us out, just hoping against hope that the voters will save us. It's kind of unreasonable to expect that when you, the person we elected president to get us out of this hole, didn't fire the biggest obstacle to our starting to dig. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/30/134935.html#a135926" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
