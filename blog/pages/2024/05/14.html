<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131039"></a>Yesterday's OpenAI big press event was a nothing burger. I thought they already had all of that stuff, they certainly had been at least telegraphing it. Also there never will be another Steve Jobs, it's too bad everyone is using his template for product announcements. It only works if you're Steve Jobs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/14.html#a131039" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131234"></a>BTW, I've been to three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote">Stevenotes</a>, the first one, the rollout of the Mac  in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in 1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/14.html#a131234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's a better speaker than either of the other candidates. If he didn't a speech impediment I'd say he was basically a sure thing. I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where "future" is less than a year away.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/14.html#a123837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130247"></a>In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/14/125908.html#a130247" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130338"></a>Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/14/125908.html#a130338" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130400"></a>And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season">bench players</a>, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/14/125908.html#a130400" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
