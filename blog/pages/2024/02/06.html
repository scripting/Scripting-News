If there were an Apple Store nearby I probably would have already gotten it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/06.html#a212013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153201"></a>I'm reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oath-Honor-Warning-Liz-Cheney/dp/0316572063">Liz Cheney's book</a>, and forgot something I had guessed during the insurrection. While it was going on Trump was calling Congresspeople saying if you stop the count I'll call off the attack. In other words, trade your life for a vote. I suspected it before, but they have testimony that verifies it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/06.html#a153201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143830"></a>I'm doing some writing about writing and finding the phrase "RSS, Atom and RFD" too cumbersome. Most people don't care and see the distinctions as unnecessary. But I want to be accurate, and recognize that while RSS is the most-used kind of feed, there are others, and our software works with them. I'm trying this construction: "RSS-compatible." I think that expresses the most important point, the choice of format is up to you, but now, by 2024, they all work pretty much the same way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/06.html#a143830" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140936"></a>Good morning. The main static server I <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a143645">mentioned</a> yesterday has been relocated to a fresh, new and apparently healthy server to perform its past duties. We're off to a good start this Tuesday morning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/06.html#a140936" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
