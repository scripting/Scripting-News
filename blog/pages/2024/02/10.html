Would I feel differently if I knew a work of art that I found inspiring was created by an AI. At first I said no, because what matters in art is how it is received, not how it was created. What effect did it have on the viewer. That's the art. But then I remembered that when I found out that Wordle was edited by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle#:~:text=In%20November%202022%2C%20the%20Times,checks%20each%20word%20for%20suitability.">human</a>, that the words were chosen by a person not at random, I found the game less interesting, because certain words obviously would be eliminated from consideration, even though they are in the dictionary and are used in normal writing and speech. I found myself guessing at who the editor is, and that's not why I play Wordle. I don't know why, but understanding this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Bennett">person</a> isn't it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/10.html#a152319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142802"></a>It would be interesting if every feed for a wordpress.com site included the <i>site_ID</i> of the site an item came from, and if every item had the <i>ID</i> of the item it came from. Shorten the distance from seeing something that needs editing to actually being able to edit it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/10/142750.html#a142802" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142822"></a>A WordPress-aware reader might be able to do something with this.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142838"></a>Isn't it time for there to be a WordPress namespace? After all it's not only a big part of the web, it's also a big part of the feed world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/10/142750.html#a142838" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
