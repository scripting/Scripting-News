Also that writing is not going into any search engine. Normally I watch out for this, but they got me, and you, to write for them for free, and I pay them $20 a month for the privilege. However in balance it is worth it, at least in the short term.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/24.html#a161904" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It suggests, among other things, that I reconsider whether ChatGPT is a good deal.
