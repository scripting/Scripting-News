Physical comedy for some reasons is ROTFL funny. They can do this because everyone knows and loves their delicious product and while it isn't good for you, it won't kill you either. And the announcer is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bojack+horseman">Bojack Horseman</a>, so you know that's pretty cool too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/12.html#a235040" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I didn't like all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/12.html#a154949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
