How there's good and bad that come with getting on, and Repubs (of course) have been focusing on the bad but the journalists aren't getting the other side. One thing is for sure, it's hard to put one over on someone who's been in politics at the highest level for as long as President Joe has been. That's what the "know better" part is about. Whatever you can say about him, he knows a lot about being president. I've been using this motto as my own tagline for a while. But in the interest of protecting our democracy, I think the president should use it for his re-election campaign. No charge. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/22.html#a031907" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a2fe021a8e3ee580&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&sxsrf=ACQVn09xZcYYO14qGpQ6FPXz7LE5WADxEw:1708610594208&q=john+lennon&tbm=isch&source=lnms&prmd=ivnhsmbtz&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjPwJu8jr-EAxVoGtAFHWOfBiQQ0pQJegQIDRAB&biw=1511&bih=1029&dpr=2">see them</a> as the same person. Not the other Beatles, they all make sense to me. Sometimes they have longer hair or a beard or whatever, but it's still the same face as before. Also I have trouble figuring out which Beatle is singing sometimes. On some songs it's perfectly obvious, others I have no clue. For example Norwegian Wood, Come Together, Strawberry Fields and Lucy in the Sky, that's John of course. Right? Hey Jude, that's clearly Paul, as is Let it Be, Yesterday. But for years I didn't know who sang Lady Madonna. Martha My Dear? Paul could sing so many different kinds of music. John, not so much. I guess. I'm still pretty unsure. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/22/135818.html#a032539" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

This community blends futuristic architecture harmoniously with nature, featuring energy-efficient homes, community centers, and public spaces all connected by pedestrian pathways and lush gardens. Solar panels and wind turbines integrate seamlessly into the buildings, and the central plaza acts as a hub for gatherings, surrounded by parks, sports fields, and a lake for water activities.
