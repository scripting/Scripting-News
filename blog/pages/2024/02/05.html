<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143807"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I was asked about the difference between <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> and <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>. Which should you create a new account on? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a143807" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145801"></a>feedland.org runs on a small <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">Digital Ocean server</a>, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size relatively small scale server that can't expand, and the latter is designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of 2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a145801" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145843"></a>If you're creating something new, definitely create it on feedland.com. If you're already using feedland.org, for now you're welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving useful to have around, so I don't imagine it'll go away, it's much easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based server. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a145843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150012"></a>You should assume that some day <i>all</i> these systems will disappear. The web is ephemeral. But -- my guess is <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> will be around longer. However, honestly, I really have no idea, no one does. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a150012" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143645"></a>BTW, while we're doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a combination of software that suddenly aren't getting along with each other. Obviously something changed. I'm running it in a somewhat crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of the downsides of having fun with server software.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a143645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's a time capsule for so many of us. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Car">1988</a>.
