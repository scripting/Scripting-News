<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162319"></a>A new rule for journalists. End the interview on the first egregious lie. Turn the lights out, switch off the recorder, get up and leave. And your report should state clearly that this is why the interview was terminated. It never should have been tolerated in the first place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/12.html#a162319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If a president freaks out over something like this, how would he handle a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>? Remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg">phone call</a> at 3AM? We saw what he did with COVID, he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/politics/kamala-harris-speech/index.html">froze</a>, like he's freezing now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/12.html#a163833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's an insurmountable job for scripting.com. 30 years of writing is on that domain, lots of different runtimes on lots of different domains which would also have to be converted. Images in all the pages. All that breaks when you flip the switch. I can't walk away from a big part of my life's work. Sorry, not for Google. Every time someone assumes I'm to blame for this situation, that's how Google has tricked you. I followed the rules. They broke them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/12.html#a162013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
