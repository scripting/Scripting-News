This could get a simple colorful user-friendly interface for WordPress, something it's needed for a long time. WordPress does everything in its UI, Tumblr has its UI better organized for writers and more casual users. If they can move in this direction, it seems that WordPress could be large part of the emerging <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/19/200828.html">social web</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/28.html#a182023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183721"></a>An idea for the Harris campaign. Let me buy some <a href="https://store.kamalaharris.com/">swag</a> and have it sent to 10 of my best friends, esp ones who live in swing states. Plus you get the names and contact info for people at least one of your supporters thought would be a potential Harris voter. I'd send something less presumptuous like <i>When We Fight We Win</i> stickers. Another related idea, let me buy a whole set of promotional materials, kind of like the gift baskets they sell at <a href="https://www.zabars.com/zabars-babka-and-rugelach-crate/C110038.html">Zabar's</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/28.html#a183721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135724"></a>Note to the Harris campaign: This <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:youtube.com+harris+ads&tbm=nws">Google search</a> should return a complete list of your ads. Or a pointer to a site with a complete list of your ads. I want to make sure everyone who follows me sees every one of them!
