<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/librarian.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160116"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/12/librarian.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">For some reason I don't like writing <a href="https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml">user</a>-<a href="https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md">level</a> docs for my own software, but I don't mind narrating a draft with voice. Now that I have a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/26/150516.html">voice recorder</a> that creates transcripts exactly where I need them, I can feed the narration to ChatGPT and ask it to write docs based on features I describe that are part of the current software, and leave out notes about possible changes or additions. It took me 13 minutes to do the narration, because I talk more slowly than it writes, and I ramble and get distracted. It took the bot less than a second to produce a near-perfect outline. It left out a bit that I wanted included, it was added in a second. Then I asked for an <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> version of the docs so I could edit it, and pass back the edited version. It got a bit confused and gave me a JSON version of the outline, and Node.js code to convert it to the XML, but when I pointed out a simpler way to do it, I got what I needed in less than a second. And <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/docsOutline.png">here it is</a>, in my outliner, ready for me to add notes, and edit and reorganize. ChatGPT is a team member, not a surrogate. Another amazing experience, absolutely no going back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/03.html#a160116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144319"></a>Saw a video where Elon Musk talks about climate change, no snark, didn't call it a hoax, was intelligent and serious. Also heard that he's backing Trump for president, who  says it's a hoax and one of his major campaign promises is to "drill baby drill." Maybe they could discuss this because there seems to be a disagreement here.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/03.html#a144319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

She is at the Carnegie Deli in NYC to meet the Republican VP candidate, to talk about a debate, but the Repub is a no-show! Weird. Meanwhile the press is having fun asking her embarrassing questions about a cat in the White House. They want to know if the WH has a litter box. What if she gets pregnant? Stuff like that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/03/222554.html#a222602" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
