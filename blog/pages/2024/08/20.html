She died in 2018, and I still haven't, deep inside, fully gotten the message that she's gone. Probably the most significant person in my life. I find most of my adult relationships can be traced back to my relationship with her. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20.html#a134439" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135234"></a>When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in comparison to the <i>president</i> who was about to speak. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/135836.html#a135234" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140556"></a>Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence next to Harris is almost always awkward. He's taller, and moves a lot. I noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/135836.html#a140556" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135906"></a>Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I'm not sure that pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a sugar high.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/135836.html#a135906" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135915"></a>One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don't pretend they aren't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/135836.html#a135915" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140833"></a>They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment speech about them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/135836.html#a140833" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140300"></a>To the extent we can, it's time to push them aside. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/135836.html#a140300" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140843"></a>When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat over and over, "Ignore the NY Times."

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142719"></a>In this <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png">drawing</a> the NYT is reporting on how the kitten loves lasagna, and of course how cute she is (it's important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/20/142602.html#a142719" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142735"></a>This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful! Keeping me entertained while we try to get through this election.
