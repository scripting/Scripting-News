It's all made of imagery. Bernie Sanders is someone you either love or don't. He reminds me of people in my own family, who I would <i>never</i> want to be president of anything. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug">this ad</a>, the best ever imho, says wait a minute, please reconsider. A campaign is a series of messages from candidate to electorate: "Is this who we are?" The great ads tap our optimism, imho. The Sanders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug">ad</a> says we're nice happy people who have jobs and help each other.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/29.html#a151645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152806"></a>I can't read most of the stories I want to read. I have the money and am willing to spend it.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154129"></a>I am not cheap. The news system realllly doesn't work. It could be fixed, but for the usual problem -- they would have to work with each other. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/29/153350.html#a154129" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153419"></a>If you think the NYT is a huge success, compare its size to the size of Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon or Apple, all of whom have made great businesses out of distributing other people's products. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/29/153350.html#a153419" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154325"></a>I generated graph in <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/8bbe7d22-89d4-4fc3-b3c3-d56993da3e00">ChatGPT</a> by just asking for it. It has great chart software built-in. Quietly they are rearranging all the pieces of software we use. They will end up owning everything, and meanwhile people are asking if this is a bubble. Not really. More like an invasion. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/29/153350.html#a154325" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
