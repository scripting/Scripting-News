What made me realize it is how natural the idea of <i>President Kamala</i> feels. Men and women are different, just like blacks and whites are different (it couldn't be otherwise) but we are all Americans, and further, taken together we all <i>are</i> America. All of this sprung from that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/2012-05-24-how-red-and-blue-states-split-on-green-we-spend-differently.html">Obama quote</a> in his 2004 convention speech (which I was lucky to be present for, that was the year they welcomed bloggers). It's the one country that's the Union of all of us and we are United. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/23.html#a184047" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190941"></a>I'm trying to teach ChatGPT how to do sidebar art. So far, it's not a great student. But I have hope. My instructions for the image in the post in the sidebar for the previous post: "e pluribus unum" is the motto of the United States. Out of many one. I would like a simple picture of an eagle with this motto over its head, in the same style it is in on the back of a quarter coin. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/23.html#a190941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191147"></a>This is how I explained what a sidebar art is: There's a certain kind of art I need to create with you. I call it "sidebar art" -- they are images between 75 and 135 pixels wide. The content is on a transparent background. They are designed to fit in the right margin of my blog at scripting.com. Please remember this definition, so you can help me create new sidebar art.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/23.html#a191147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
