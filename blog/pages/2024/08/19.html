This isn't exactly a new <a href="https://this.how/rulesForJournalism/">rule for journalism</a>, but it's worth mentioning anyway. If you wouldn't want to read the piece yourself, don't let them put your name on it. Example. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/kamala-harris-2010-debate.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EE4.7g6L.aTYQ0sm2Xwz6&smid=url-share">story</a> promises to tell you about 47 seconds that saved Kamala Harris's career. They do eventually tell you the words, but you have to wade through a lot of pointless bullshit to get to it. If I were writing it, the first words of the piece would have to be the words, and then explain it. You've seen this over and over and it gets worse all the time. I still don't understand why they do it, if I'm reading the piece, I'm a paying subscriber, right? Another example of disrespect, quit trying to upsell paying customers. Once a month maybe, but not every 8th time I visit your site. Most businesses have no regard for their customers' time, but the ones that do, really make an impression. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/19.html#a140827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200025"></a>The Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">page</a> for Living Videotext begins with one of our slogans. It was a joke, and meant to keep us humble, so we listen to users. It was one of many such slogans. LVT made some important contributions to the networks we use today. Wikipedia should talk about that first, show some respect, for crying out loud. Otherwise, except for that snipe up front, the account is actually pretty accurate. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/19.html#a200025" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142623"></a>It's nice to see the DNC <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-democratic-national-convention-is-giving-influencers-media-credentials-for-the-first-time-why-both-campaigns-are-pivoting-to-social-first-strategies-110059052.html">including influencers</a> this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html">at the DNC in 2004</a>, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/19.html#a142623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012413"></a>There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it's where most of the traffic already goes. It's quite possibly not running that smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction, huge traffic, broken systems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/19/200828.html#a012413" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they're not going away. Companies that large don't disappear. After 40 years of experience in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very rarely disappear. It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation">does</a> happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles#Counterculture_of_the_1960s_and_1970s">Laurel Canyon</a>.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135307"></a>In 2017, I started an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">archive</a> of my <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> writing on GitHub. It's still just a fraction of my writing, I'm not doing anything like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I've managed to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month, which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/19/134815.html#a135307" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates.

There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this.
