<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122204"></a>I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to <a href="https://www.tonykahn.org/home">this autobiographical site</a> where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn't often credited. He was at WGBH at the time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/02.html#a122204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
