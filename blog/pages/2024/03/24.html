<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a225729"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I still love reading <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/24/myblogrollpost.png">my own stuff</a> in the blogroll. Learning how to make stuff look good in a tiny little format like that. I don't mind having a small space to deploy in, but I like to have lots of room where I write. Linkblogs and blogrolls go together really well. Blogrolls work best for smaller groups of people and projects, not the huge number of followers people have on the twitter-like social web. But I think even a few hundred items in a blogroll work, as long as it's dynamic, and it's reverse chronologic. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/24.html#a225729" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a224816"></a>Never thought I'd be so glad to see the <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xml-rpc site</a> back up and running. I found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I'm not sure I would have noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of years ago. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/24.html#a224816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125952"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299">Braintrust query</a>: I have not been able to reliably get to a bunch of my sites that use HTTP this morning. For example, <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://techfightclub.wordpress.com/feed/">feeder.scripting.com</a>, a site that I use to test feeds. Also <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a>. It's possible that something broke overnight in my server. Or Digital Ocean is having a problem? Doesn't seem like it's something Google is doing to punish me for using HTTP, though that is always the first thing that comes to mind. I tried moving the XML-RPC site to a different server, but the problem follows it. No changes have been made to the site in years. Not exactly what I had planned to be digging into on a nice (but cold) Sunday morning in the mountains. I started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299">thread</a>, if you have any insights. At least scripting.com is still working, but it's not served through my software or Digital Ocean. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/24.html#a125952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221454"></a>So I went ahead and moved <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xmlrpc.com</a> to a HTTPS server. The <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/22/031933.html">other day</a> I forgot to mention that style sheets might not be readable when you move from HTTP to HTTPS, leading to <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/24/httpsBreaksSitesThanksGoogle.png">this striking breakage</a> I saw when I first got to look at the site in its new location. And now thanks to Google and the EFF, I get to spend time debugging something that worked just fine in 1998 and every year since then. Should I send them the bill for my time? Fuckers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/24.html#a221454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
