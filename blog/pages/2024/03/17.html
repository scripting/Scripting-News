I should not have listened to the podcast.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/17.html#a201646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Find some new connection I can make because someone was wise enough to add an RSS interface. I get to have an <i>aha!</i> moment and a good laugh at how great this is and then write a freaking blog post about it, and people think man this web thing is pretty cool.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/17.html#a194939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
