And get this the printer could take its input from any of those writing tools. There were no <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/22/tinyLittleTextBox.png">tiny little text boxes</a>. The printers didnâ€™t come with their own editors, you had choice and therefore there was lots of competition. Amazing, right?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/22.html#a123748" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Every image in every page breaks. Broken images make a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/22/statement.png">statement</a>, they're like broken windows, they say no one gives a F about this site. Well I care about the archive of scripting.com, I hope people understand that. I have been creating a record here since 1994. It'll be 30 years in October.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/22/031933.html#a132716" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
