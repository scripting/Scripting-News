You keep a diary so people who come through there next year and the year after will know what you tried and why it didn't work. Like using a GET when the RESTful thing is a POST. I once got excoriated by a famous security expert in public for doing this (XML-RPC only uses POST) but I had and have the best intentions. Back then in 1998, when I made the choice, I was juggling a billion flaming bowling pins. Back then there was no ChatGPT to ask about prior art. I had to move on. Well here we are again in 2024. I hope the next person traveling through the area in question sees what I didn't see. People who have worked on my code know that if you <a href="http://scripting.com/listings/pagepark.html">read it in an outliner</a>, you'll see lots of blog posts with extensive <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/28/comments.png">comments</a> that read more like a blog than software. Some functions have a thread of comments going back to the early 90s and not just from me. Outliners are great for writing code, because a long comment takes up exactly one line until you expand it. So you can go on and on and not stop until you're finished. Thank you and have a nice day. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/28.html#a154357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It said I was wrong, but in fact, it was wrong.

I'm interested in knowing if people had problems, and is the new package much better than the original?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/28.html#a194726" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145124"></a>An algorithm for content moderation for reducing the human contact trolls have. If you notice an account that gets blocked by a lot of people who don't follow them after they reply to one of their posts, then slow them down or throw out their replies. Eventually if it keeps up, you pretty much know it's software, and you can delete the account. I guess. Just thinking out loud. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/28.html#a145124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
