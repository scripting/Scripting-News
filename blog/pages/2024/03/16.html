I'd like to have a bit of JavaScript code ask to be notified when the user clicks on a link on my page that gets them a 404. I'd like a chance to do some looking around and seeing if I can find the thing they wanted. This comes up when you look at the archive of this blog for <a href="http://scripting.com/1999/03.html">March 1999</a>. Back then my server was a Macintosh which had a case-insensitive operating system. A few years later I moved all the stuff to Amazon S3, much less hassle, and probably cheaper too. But over there the filesystem is case-sensitive. I must've been typing in URLs by hand and not caring about case, because why should I, my server didn't care. Except now it does care and when I click links to pages I know <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/03/18/everyonesEquallyNasty.html">are there</a>, but <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/03/everyonesEquallyNasty.html">can't</a> be found, I get depressed. I wanted to read the damn thing, that's why I clicked on it. Not to see some cute <a href="https://scripting.com/thispageisnottherehahahah">404 page</a> (although it is pretty nice). Even better would be a way to tell Amazon to serve this bucket without regard to case. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/16.html#a164134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165506"></a>Saying the web <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social">misses</a> Google Reader is like saying the United States misses President Trump. Why do I think that? Think of the mess Google left behind when they dumped the web. Putting all our cards in one basket in software is a very very very very bad idea. As everyone who misses The Orange Feed Reader is evidence of. It's like someone rips you off bad and all you can think about is how much you miss them. You, sir or madam, need to get your head examined.
