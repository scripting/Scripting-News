Or move a paragraph from one story to another with drag and drop. In a page-oriented editor, you get to focus on the writing for one page, but navigating outside that post is more jarring, a writer more easily loses the train of thought. I've been <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/31/outline.png">writing</a> in an outliner almost exclusively for decades, only now considering the writing world outside. Learning a lot.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/31.html#a161730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164241"></a>I start a fresh outline for this blog on the first of every month, so tomorrow I will <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml">archive</a> my blog.opml file on GitHub, start a new month, and delete the previous month. I've been doing that since 2017, when I finally forever gave up trying to interop with the great blogging silos (ie Twitter and Facebook mainly). I think outlining is like double-diamond skiing, but for writing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/31.html#a164241" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
