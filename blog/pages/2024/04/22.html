I'm building on feeds -- RSS, Atom, RDF. A lot of good stuff works on that basis. And it's a much shorter path to <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">interop</a> than ActivityPub.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/22.html#a171256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132020"></a>I hate paywalls tied to subscription. I’m never going to subscribe to a Philadelphia news org, but based on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jayrosen.bsky.social/post/3kqnxdwej3s2c">Jay’s recommendation</a> I might pay $1 on my <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/130438.html?title=howEzpassForNewsWouldWork">EZ Pass for News</a> to read <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/civil-war-movie-about-journalism-20240421.html">this story</a>, esp since I saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(film)">Civil War</a> movie. I just had a thought, I might subscribe to a Philadelphia news org for a week or two, given that the Knicks are playing their NBA team right now in the first round of the playoffs. I really want to know everything there is to know about this faceoff. See, I want to pay for journalism here, but journalism hasn't been willing to sell it to me, at any price. They've never gotten the basic truth of: "The customer is always right." Really important point and true in every way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/22.html#a132020" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130009"></a>Over the weekend I <a href="https://techfightclub.wpcomstaging.com/">tested</a> the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> plugin for WordPress. It worked. After a little more testing and docs-writing we'll be ready for other people to test it, an important step before wider use. So if you're a regular Scripting News reader, and are curious what this blogroll stuff is about, you'll be able to try it out pretty soon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/22.html#a130009" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
