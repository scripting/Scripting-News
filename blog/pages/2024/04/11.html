CSS is a junk pile of reinventing that learned nothing from the ideas it was reinventing. The only reason we put up with this is the freedom we got from it. But thatâ€™s been gone for a long time. I have a feeling weâ€™re wasting our golden years overlooking that weâ€™re trying to get creative work done in a corporate crime scene. We won, only to have our victory enshrined by a bunch of corpy wiseasses and nazis." Doc is a very literate and quote-worthy writer, and we bring out the best from each other. So next time you see Doc thank him for me, for the creativity. We're making the best of a bad situation. It's even worse than it appears and I'm old enough to know better.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a223210"></a>Found this in my desk drawer today. Amazing the things you carry with you over the ages. I lived in an apartment building on top of a hill in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1100+Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.424696,-122.2298177,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fa4f7ba716f5d:0x4318060066990628!8m2!3d37.4247727!4d-122.2181447!16s%2Fg%2F11c1343h_f?entry=ttu">middle of a golf course</a>, smack in the heart of Silicon Valley, if it actually had a heart, and that's debatable. All the Sand Hill Road VCs were on the other side of the hill. And one exit south on 280 was Xerox PARC, and where NeXT had its startup offices. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/11/223201.html#a223210" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a223413"></a>This was the place where I started development of what became <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I always wanted to do a great system level scripting thing, based on what I learned from Unix and what I loved about the graphic user interface. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/11/223201.html#a223413" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a224748"></a>It became a lot bigger than I anticipated. In the beginning it was meant to be a replacement for the Macintosh Finder, with an outliner for a file system browser, and of course a fantastic scripting ability, of the OS and of scriptable apps. I wish Apple had supported this effort but I didn't understand at the time that they couldn't. They weren't set up to let anyone but Bill and Andy make great products, even if their products weren't all that great, imho of course. You have to live with the mythology you create. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/11/223201.html#a224748" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a224814"></a>A lot of people got their first programming experience with Hypercard. I would have loved if more of them get their first experience with Frontier. Even better would have been if our products worked together, but that wasn't in the cards either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/11/223201.html#a224814" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
