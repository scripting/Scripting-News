The drawing functionality recalcs while you're entering the prompt, so if you type, "vary gender, age and race," and as you type each word, the image changes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/18.html#a013021" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more <i>fluidity. </i>Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't. So they got all the casual writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I think it's time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on features and lock-in. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/18.html#a134722" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
