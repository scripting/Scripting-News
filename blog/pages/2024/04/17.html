<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143526"></a>I just tripped across this <a href="https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2009/12/12/wordpress-com-implements-the-twitter-api-2/">post from 2009</a> where Matt had sent me an email saying they were supporting the Twitter API in WordPress. I had forgotten this. That's how long it's been that he's wanted to hook WP up to the social web. It doesn't look like I posted that to Scripting News. I wonder what other nuggets of forgotten history I'll find there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/17.html#a143526" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
