It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a> about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/14.html#a011848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Knicks finish second. Best Knicks team in a long time. Ended the season with a five-game winning streak.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/14.html#a202317" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/14.html#a011808" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
