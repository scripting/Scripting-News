Do you remember when you first realized that people weren't talking to you in a response to your post, they were talking over your shoulder to the people who read your post. I guess it depends on who you are, but I don't see any value in providing a surface for spam. These days I block people without much thought if I think that's what they're doing. So, why should you design a protocol, and pay the cost of supporting, something that is a vector for spam and abuse? That's the argument in favor of using <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> to glue things together. You can comment on my post, in your space, but my followers don't have to see it. That's up to me. I think it would change the nature of discourse, for the better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/25.html#a153349" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Every time I hear "Where ever you get your podcasts," I'm reminded of how well that worked. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/25.html#a200556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123234"></a>ChatGPT has memory across chats. This just <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptmessage.png">popped up</a> on the screen. I'd like to tell it that until further notice I use Node.js and do not use Express, and do use jQuery for my browser-based JavaScript, and I use the debugger all the time, so you can assume that. If this works, I now have a programming partner with memory. And maybe I can somehow get it to read all my blog posts going back 30 years? I have good archives of most of it. Also, of course I <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptcomments.png">fed this post</a> to ChatGPT of course. So ChatGPT is not resting on its laurels. That's good. I'd really like a <i>Personal ChatGPT, </i>and this is on the way to that goal. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/25.html#a123234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
