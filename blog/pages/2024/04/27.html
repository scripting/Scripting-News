<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164154"></a>I asked ChatGPT: "Could I paste in the source code of a JS package i wrote and 1. ask you to remember it and 2. ask you questions about it later?" Short version of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/86c43002-1762-495d-9eb8-c928c3afb23d">answer</a> -- no. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27.html#a164154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135355"></a>A use-case for ChatGPT. You get a hard-to-understand error message from MySQL, so you send the code to ChatGPT and it gives you a perfect error message, and gives you the corrected code. It also can generate SQL from an actual English language description. Quite a loop-close, since SQL was sold as programming in English, just like COBOL or AppleScript, except in ChatGPT you really are using English. It's precise English, but not "marketing" English (ie non-technical managers can be fooled by what they see). An intelligent non-programmer could actually write code, not sure of that of course since I am a programmer myself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27.html#a135355" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124519"></a>I love that I can ask ChatGPT how to spell the word <i>expos√©</i> in a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/b229346f-8a8c-435f-ae56-986d31a16b3d">literate way</a>. Google is difficult about it. It tried to erase the word from my query, then gave me the wrong spelling. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27.html#a124519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125237"></a>I was pleased to read the <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/a-statement-from-the-new-york-times-on-presidential-news-coverage/">NYT op-ed</a> complaining that President Biden wouldn't sit for an interview.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a125237" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125313"></a>I didn't forget they did that, as I'm sure President Biden hasn't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a125313" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125326"></a>As I understand it, the proper DOJ procedure for not charging someone is to say nothing. You might write them a letter to tell them they don't need to prepare to defend themselves. Anything more than that puts your motives in question, and should get you fired as a DOJ attorney. I never saw a NYT article that even asked this question -- who is this person and why should we care what he thinks about Biden. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a125326" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130319"></a>And btw, is it good journalism to raise an issue of basic competence about the sitting President of the United States without a bit more background and substance? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a130319" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130352"></a>How is giving credit to such a story journalism? Sounds like trash that would run in the National Enquirer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a130352" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125934"></a>The NYT has a lot of nerve after covering that "story" so extensively, to demand that Biden sit for an interview. Can you imagine. They'd be reviewing anything but what he said. So disrespectful of our president.  And so disrespectful of the Americans who elected him. If you want to raise an issue, come prepared with some journalism to back it up. That's what we expect from the NYT, not what we got from them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a125934" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125725"></a>PS: On the other hand, thanks to the NYT for posting this on their own website. The often used Medium in the past for statements like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/27/125231.html#a125725" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
