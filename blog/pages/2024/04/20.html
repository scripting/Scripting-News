	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161821"></a>After living with the blogroll on the home page of Scripting News for <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html">about a month</a>, and having heard from early testers, I felt that it was demanding too much attention when I was reading stuff on the blog. So I made some time last week to experiment with a subtler sidebar.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html#a161821" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161954"></a>In <i>Quiet Mode,</i> the blogroll doesn't call attention to itself until you click on it. Then its background changes from neutral to white. That's the equivalent of shining a spotlight on it. Also the borders become blue to indicate that the browser's focus is on the blogroll.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html#a161954" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162053"></a>I wanted to do more to tone it down. So, in Quiet Mode the title moves up and to the left, and is in a much smaller font, boldface, nicely visible and stands off from the list, but doesn't call your attention to it. It's there when you want to know more. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html#a162053" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163340"></a>You may want to call it something other than a blogroll, btw. If you're using blogs to coordinate projects with others, something I think a lot more people would do if it worked better, instead of "blogroll" you'd might call it your "workgroup."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html#a163340" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162229"></a>Anyway, I have switched <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> over to the new quiet mode, it's already the default, but I put a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/20/checkbox.png">checkbox</a> just below the blogroll that lets you toggle between the two modes to see the difference and possibly spot problems. The checkbox will go away before long. I just want it there to quickly do an A-B comparison. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html#a162229" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162930"></a>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zfNS97NUHB4">quick video demo</a> of Quiet Mode. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/20/161811.html#a162930" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
