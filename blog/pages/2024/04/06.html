I’m not a copypaste machine. Technically, it’s an easy problem to solve, and I don’t see how it hurts various tech companies to let users  write  in  their  favorite  editor.  This  is  severely  limiting  what  we  can  do  with  networks,  and  there  seems  to  be  no  reason  for  it.  APIs  let  us  build  networks  out  of software.  Devs,  take  a  chance  on  other  developers.  Let  the  web  expand.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152717"></a>Going back and fixing a poorly tested corner-turn, esp one you did a while ago, is a time-consuming and frustrating process. You need to have a fully consistent model to evolve. When you try to reorganize a complicated bit of code, and you find yourself scratching your head about how this or that works, that's a sign that it <i>doesn't</i> work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/06/152655.html#a152717" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152816"></a>But it's much more fun to add new features to a broken foundation than it is to either fix the foundation or rip it out and put in a new one. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/06/152655.html#a152816" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
