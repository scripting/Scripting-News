<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164245"></a>BTW, straight -- everything Kara Swisher claims to be, the insider with the best view of the industry, they got that wrong. The things that matter happen far away from her conferences and dinners. It's as if Silicon Valley were Hollywood. To some people it is. But the big changes are never recognized by those people until they're juggernauts. They don't make the changes. They soak them up and devour them. They best of the people she writes about are not creators, they're pirates.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09.html#a164245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154657"></a>I'm not sure I'd buy a Tesla today because of Musk's politics which he puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of people dying. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a154657" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160952"></a>On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who developed it, who I don't know. I hope they're not Nazis. I don't see how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla">2021</a>, the year I bought mine, could be anything like that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a160952" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161009"></a>This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a161009" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161045"></a>To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be hard for me to do. I don't think my "support" of Tesla could mean that much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car (one of its innovations). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a161045" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161109"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It's like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even if I wasn't one of Apple's top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs didn't design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did. Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial. That's a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a161109" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160643"></a>Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don't want these products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those are some of the brightest people out there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a160643" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161308"></a>Meanwhile I'm looking at other company's EVs with lust. I might like a Kia or a BMW. If you're making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a161308" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162147"></a>PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by <a href="https://werd.io/">Ben Wurdmuller</a> <a href="https://werd.io/2024/i-tried-tesla-fsd">posted yesterday</a>. I've had much the same feeling about <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>. This piece started out to be about FSD, but the preamble, like the one in his piece, got so long I decided to post it first as its own piece. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html#a162147" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
