<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143612"></a>It's noteworthy that we haven't seen many outages as Bluesky scales. On Twitter they had <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2011/12/31/failWhale.gif">fail whales</a> for years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/20.html#a143612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135113"></a>What matters with social networks is what you can get done there, not so much the features of the network. Bluesky has the same features today it had a month ago. The difference is we had an election in the US, I guess that was the catalyst. The presence of Elon Musk so close to Trump says there is a need for a Musk-free place. I've kept my account on Twitter. I started there in 2006, and I love the web more than I feel it would do any good to erase my presence there. It's pretty much against my religion to deliberately erase bits of the web. And whatever you think of Twitter, it is most definitely part of the web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/20.html#a135113" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
