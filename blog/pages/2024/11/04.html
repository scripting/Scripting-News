<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/14/strongman.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143253"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/14/strongman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;"><a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a>: The other day I asked a famous blogger who uses RSS if he would be willing to share his list of feeds, so others could subscribe to them. He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he couldn't share. I certainly understand that. Then I realized, as often is the case, that I could do myself what I had been asking others to do. And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people who didn't use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> wouldn't know <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png">how to find</a> them. So I decided to make it easier. On <a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a> I've got a link to the <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/podcasts.opml">lists of podcasts</a> I'm subscribed to. That list should update every hour for any additions or removals from this list. I don't update the list very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me know if you do, I'd love to see what you do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04.html#a143253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We need great turnout this year, record-setting turnout, as a show of love for our country and our Constitution. Vote now, because later you might not have any power to change direction. Tomorrow, you do have power. <b>And remember that voting is not you expressing yourself, it's not free speech, it's you and I governing. </b>This is our moment of greatest power. Use it or lose it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04.html#a134017" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132828"></a>My opinion: At this point it doesnâ€™t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04/132817.html#a132828" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132843"></a>After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know the basic rules of journalism, imho that's much easier than the know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view from nowhere</a>, trying to understand what they're writing about. They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04/132817.html#a132843" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133109"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen">Jay Rosen</a> and I did a <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">series of podcasts</a> in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news going forward. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04/132817.html#a133109" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133215"></a>They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer. I think that's the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on current events. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04/132817.html#a133215" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133930"></a>Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this, the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn't now be owned by Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/04/132817.html#a133930" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
