<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161924"></a>I wasn't clear enough yesterday. We're losing the word "podcast" very quickly. It's come to mean video interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there's no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms with no silo walls, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting distribution deals from Google, Apple, Spotify and Amazon. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the government leaders, who will want to impose severe limits. This isn't a casual request, it's <i>urgent.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/30.html#a161924" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
