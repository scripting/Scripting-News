I see it that way too. When <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/">Brian Lehrer asked</a> a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/17.html#a152212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
