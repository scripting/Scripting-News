<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145303"></a>I prayed. I really did. But I got the wrong answer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a145303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145357"></a>In 2016, on the night of Election Day, when it was obvious Trump would win, before taking a Xanax and going to sleep, I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html">piece</a>, that my friend Chuck Shotton <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social/post/3labvjcfh2j2k">says</a> I should run again. Rather than doing that, I'll quote the important part. "I don't think it's about economics, I think it's about change happening too fast. And the Trump voters had the power to bring it to a screeching halt, they saw the chance and took it."  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a145357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145605"></a>First thing -- <b>Don't shut down the campaign</b>. We must keep communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down. Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing. And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero after election, whether we win or lost.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a145605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150114"></a>Blame is pointless. It may be emotionally satisfying at some level, but it is division, and that's why we keep losing elections. We don't see it but we create our own divisions. This must stop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a150114" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150124"></a>Be generous with all classes of people, by gender, age, race, religion, whatever is used to divide us. Stop <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vilifying">vilifying</a> men. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/11/05/don-lemon-james-carville-democrats-stupid-wokeness-newday-vpx.cnn">Carville was right</a>. There's no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat for all our problems. It's no accident that the Repubs own the men. We could probably have had ten percent or more of their voters if we stopped doing this. Key point, when you blame a whole gender, you hurt people who have no power to stop it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a150124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151138"></a>Speaking of Carville, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/election-day-special-edition-feat-james-carville/id1523896927?i=1000675748922">yesterday's Trippi podcast</a> with Carville as the only guest was the <b>best podcast</b> I've ever heard. I recommended it yesterday as inspirational. Now that we know the outcome of the election, it's a marker of where we were before the results were known. A world that no longer exists. But like stories written in 2016, the markers are useful to see where we once were and how we got here, and what we can learn from what happened between. I wish it had turned out the way these two great friends thought it should have. But it didn't. But there was a hint that they knew what wouldn't work this time. No spoilers.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151335"></a>Ben Thompson wrote in his <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> newsletter: "What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective itâ€™s a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!" I wrote in 2017, that <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">some Repub would buy Twitter</a>, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now. When I begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612">didn't</a> miss this.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155539"></a>"Richest man in the world" doesn't begin to cover Musk's ambition. He wants "all the money in the world."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a155539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152508"></a>Also to the Twitter founders, amassing that much power and centralizing it as Twitter did, had a cost that we're paying now. But it's very hard to stop when the juggernaut is rolling. I understand, but in the future we have to think about this more clearly. <b>When a medium becomes too big and centralized, there's trouble ahead</b>. It was accidental that Trump was the one to take advantage of this to route around journalism and go direct, but it was not accidential that Musk did. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a152508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151847"></a>Speaking of Musk, maybe he will temper Trump's desire for retribution. It may be a vain hope, but I'll cling to it anyway. Doing business in a world of retribution might not be too conducive to the creativity needed to run innovative tech businesses. A climate of fear doesn't inspire great software. I know the quality of products Musk makes, I own and love my Tesla Model Y. Best car I've ever owned or driven. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a151847" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152050"></a>My longtime friend, Mike Arrington <a href="https://x.com/arrington/status/1854134938120994912">said</a> next time have a primary. He has a point. Would Harris have been the nominee if the Dems had had a normal primary process? Who knows. Maybe the voters could have told us then that what happened yesterday was coming. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a152050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165446"></a>Final note (I think). The pain you feel at first may abate. It did for me. I had pushed down memories of 2020 and 2021. It was a horror show, and Trump was the main character. So the first thing I had to deal with is that I don't want to remember that. Too painful. But once I realized that's not where we are right now, it's a totally different situation, that's when the creative impulse rose as the pain receded. We have one short term thing to do -- keep the campaign running, and long term we have to recognize division we add, and counteract it. We are the party that welcomes everyone regardless or race, religion, country of origin, age or gender. <i>All</i> of them. No exceptions. The election result represents big change. And it's a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">good time</a> to make more changes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/06.html#a165446" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
