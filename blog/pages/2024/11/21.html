She didn't start broadcasting until three months before the election. That's not even one season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Elementary">Abbott Elementary</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show)">Wheel of Fortune</a>. Of course they didn't know her. That's because the Dems go off the air <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1854036662952620232">on Election Day</a> and don't show up again for three years. Meanwhile the other party is on the air 24 hours a day, every day of every year. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a143027" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020342"></a>Next time we nominate a candidate, the voters will already know them and like them. No more of the "we don't know her well enough." That's what mattered. They want a sense that they know who you are. The same way kids of my generation knew who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker">Archie Bunker</a> was, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maude_(TV_series)">Maude</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore">Mary Tyler Moore</a>. That's where trust comes from. We may not have liked Archie Bunker's politics, but we knew who he was. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a020342" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020233"></a>We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time so when we choose a candidate the people will already know and like them.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a020233" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143620"></a>I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-setback-for-trump-as-gopers-privately-tell-him/id1728152109?i=1000677605316">yesterday</a> where Greg Sargent and his <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-cabinet-team-of-outlaws-gaetz-hegseth-gabbard-rfk">guest</a> kept saying "we gotta figure this out." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a143620" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

Dems are only on the air for a few months every four years. Of course the other side spins you like crazy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a144036" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143629"></a>You all are clinging to the "gotcha" model of journalism. There are no more gotchas. We've known that since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape">Access Hollywood</a>. The leaders of the new Democratic Party will be comfortable in their own skin. They tell you what they think. Fetterman, AOC, Tammy Baldwin. There will be many of them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a143629" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143638"></a>Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying. When you say nothing people think you agree with them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a143638" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020727"></a>Let's get the Dems back on the air before the inauguration. I'll kick in $100 to get it started, and I'll tell everyone I know to fund it too. There's no time to waste.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html#a020727" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
