And when they want to edit the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasn’t been moving  and if we don’t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get started. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

People who say what they think and know if the press excoriates you, you can survive it, and the users will love you for it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a195707" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
