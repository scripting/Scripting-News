Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/09/chatGptWebSearch.png">screen shot</a>. We're getting there. Really nice.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/09.html#a042214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174419"></a>I'd like to hear from tech vendors, asap, which ones will help American voters learn what's true independent of whatever "truth" the government wants us to believe? Who will stand with the people? A good question for all of us to ask. Ask news orgs the same question.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/09.html#a174419" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Since we now understand that most of the information flow now goes around the NYT, CNN etc -- even Fox, and largely through social web and podcasts, if that's where we're all getting our news from, and btw MSNBC are already pretty well limited in what they'll tell us (this was our beef with NYT if you recall) -- the next step is to make it impossible for us to hear what each other are saying. Now is the time to plant seeds for a defense of our speech and communication later. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/09.html#a145637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
