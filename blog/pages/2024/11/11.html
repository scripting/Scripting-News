I wonder if they would like to keep posting. They stopped updating on Election Day. We could change the names of the accounts. I thought it was great that there was a steady source of political news that didn't equivocate like the NYT-inspired news orgs. I would love to help fund a continuation of that flow.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/11.html#a023110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
