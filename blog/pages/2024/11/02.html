There should be one way to do anything, not many. That way I can include your code in mine and vice versa. I can understand what you're doing. Tools can be developed that make it even easier to do things the only way they work. New programming languages if they really are necessary should strive to simplify the programming model, there should be less things for the developer to worry about, the more easily new ideas can be developed, the less attention you have to pay to how you'll do something over what it does. I actually don't support the other half of Postel, in everything but user interface where I do support it. I don't think in general software interfaces should be liberal with what they understand because that defeats the first half. They sort of zero each other out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02.html#a151422" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180056"></a>People may question my credentials as a language designer. I've designed a very innovative system that unfortunately the academics don't think is worth studying. It's utterly ridiculous. Who says you can only learn from systems developed at big companies or universities. I cover a lot of ground, it's true -- no one gave me permission to create <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>, but I didn't feel I needed permission. Or funding for that matter. I think what happened is Apple positioned us as less significant than their system scripting language, and people just accepted that, when Frontier is a far superior system. Anyway, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">ideas are there</a> anyway, and you're welcome to learn from them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02.html#a180056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145346"></a>The most depressing thing last night for me was reading that a longtime friend voted for the worst candidate they've ever voted for because the other one was worse. They wouldn’t say who they actually voted for. This is what we’ll be left with as a country when all this is done. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02/145335.html#a145346" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145413"></a>I gave another $100 to Harris to compensate, and of course voted straight Democratic on Thursday. Unlike my friend I was proud to vote for her. The alternative, after what we lived through between 2017 and 2021, to choose to go through that again, hard to imagine the horror.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02/145335.html#a145413" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145417"></a>And of course that’s assuming he voted for Harris.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02/145335.html#a145417" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
