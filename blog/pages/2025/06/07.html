Mathematical proofs creative things, not algorithmic. That has not been my experience with ChatGPT and creating software. I find that when I want to talk about software I'm working on, it understands what I'm saying, but I've never had it come up with an original idea on its own. A human who captivated my attention as it does, and who I spent as much time with as I do with ChatGPT would have stimulated <i>some</i> original ideas by now. If I talk with a friend for even a few minutes there will be at least one <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=aha">aha</a> moment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/07.html#a162715" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163739"></a>I'm looking for bloggers who cover the community around the <a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum conference</a>. I want to add them to my blogroll, which does a pretty good job of keeping me current with developments. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/07.html#a163739" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I am doing new things with feeds. If I do a validator, it will tell you if a feed will work with what I'm doing. I want to boot up a new layer, build on RSS, the way that not all TCP messages are HTTP (analogously), and not all XML is RSS. The differences will be minimal, and backward compatible. <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">Scripting News</a> will work very well with it, so there will be a solid example to crib from.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/07.html#a145219" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
