And doesn’t understand the leadership <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo">Cuomo</a> uniquely provided at the height of Covid. It’s pretty likely what’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg430dx702o">starting</a> in NYC will be worse than Covid or 9-11. Funny thing is Krugman <i>did</i> get it, a few weeks ago when the crisis in Los Angeles was peaking. He wrote a <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/this-is-not-a-drill">piece</a> that was terrified, and realistic. The National Guard had been nationalized. Marines were invading California. But now that Calif hasn't been in the news, it's easy to swing back. I bet if the election had happened during the worst of it, Cuomo would've won. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/26.html#a203012" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's what I say. Forget about ever rising from the ashes of what remains of the party. Right now, the issue is how to defend the city from the coming war with the US government. They're already holding the current mayor hostage. This will be worse than 9-11 and Covid. We have no leadership. We're totally fucked, what the Democratic Party does or doesn't do, at this point, simply doesn't matter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/26.html#a122239" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
