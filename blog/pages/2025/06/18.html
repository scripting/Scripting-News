	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160821"></a>I had a conversation <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emilynussbaum.bsky.social/post/3lrt3iyw5ic2j">on Bluesky</a> with a writer saying she didn't have much use for ChatGPT, though she had tried it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a160821" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163126"></a>I wanted to see if I could open a door, suggesting that next time there was an problem using a computer, that she bring the question to ChatGPT. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a163126" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163139"></a>I think that's good advice for anyone who hasn't seen how useful these are as tools. You can use it like a search engine. What comes back answers your question. With Google you'd have to read through docs that are meant to cover every angle, but the AI bot zeroes in on the issue you're dealing with. And the writing on ChatGPT is better than what you would get on a random web page explaining a technical concept. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a163139" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163344"></a><b>Passkeys</b><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a163344" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161708"></a>Previously I had tried to approach passkeys to get an idea of how I should use them, but never grasped the big picture. I just didn't understand what they were doing, but I understood it was about authentication. A hardware approach to identity, that much I got. How it worked and how I would use it did not click. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a161708" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163513"></a>And then earlier this week, an essential site that I use infrequently, required using a passkey. When I had set it up a few months ago, as part of a bigger develolpment task,  I had no idea what I was doing, and eventually bailed out, and left it unable to get back into the system, which happened on Sunday. By default the browser, Chrome, had previously connected it to my Pixel 9 Pro. There was a record of the connection being used for a variety of other services, but the one I needed was not there. This was after a full day of trying to debug it from the other side. I now have a lot more info about how passkeys work, I won't be able to say I know enough until I've re-established the connection. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a163513" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162034"></a>I know a lot of readers of this site understood passkeys without anyone having to piece it together for them. I have never been one of those people. Just the way my mind works, it's why I'm a good person to test software, I get lost easily. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a162034" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162055"></a>All this is to say -- think of ChatGPT as a technical assistant with broad knowledge and patience. That's where the real power is imho. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/161551.html#a162055" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171356"></a>PPS: Queens doesn't have an Empire State Building, and they tore down Shea Stadium. So the Unisphere from the last World's Fair will have to do. But Queens is probably the most ethnically diverse place in the world. Think about that for a minute and how the fight for the soul of the US will be fought in Queens. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/18/171022.html#a171356" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
