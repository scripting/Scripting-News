<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132426"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Regular readers of my blog know that I've been <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Bluesky">calling out Bluesky</a> and people associated with it for saying they're an open platform, and part of the web, when they are neither. Why don't people, esp journalists, call them out on this? We've been around this loop over and over in tech. There's a virtual conference today, FediForum, that on their <a href="https://fediforum.org/">home page</a> repeats <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/05/promises.png">the hype</a>. Why do people do this? What's the point of pouring your time into technology you hope someday will be open? I bought a ticket to the conference so if there are any sessions that look like they might be productive I can participate. I even wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/04/162206.html">keynote</a>, so you can see there is a way for this stuff to start working, quickly, if the vendors you're looking up to are sincere in their promises. I've posted it on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114630925085003307">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lqufhhswis2r">Bluesky</a> so if you have comments or questions, we can start the discussion now, or any time.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/05.html#a132426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134712"></a>Now a personal comment. What pisses me off most about Bluesky is the political environment all this is happening in. We <i>need</i> an open social web. They've got a lot of people convinced they are it. They are not and they know it. And they keep leading people on. They should either deliver, now, or get out of the way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/05.html#a134712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
