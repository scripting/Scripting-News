<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a113152"></a>Another <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/322#issuecomment-3018828658">criticism</a> of the Bluesky API. They make each developer do the support for Open Graph metadata, when it would be much more efficient for them to support it on their end. I would be happy to give them the code. It's not that complicated. But translating the OG format, which for crying out loud is a huge standard, into their arcane format which is only supported by Bluesky, is going in the wrong direction, and frankly is ridiculously arrogant. Show a little humility. Facebook is huge, and the format isn't just used by Facebook, everyone uses it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/30.html#a113152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a112812"></a>When I was having trouble getting into my AWS account last week, I ordered a Yubikey, which everyone says is the best way to go. I thought I'd set it up first thing Monday morning (ie now) but it <a href="https://www.yubico.com/setup/">turns out</a> it's a major undertaking? Why does this have to be so hard? I guess I'll find out, but not today. I want to make some progress on my development project first. Maybe later. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/30.html#a112812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Now, don't wait. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/30/144019.html#a144036" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144040"></a>Make it really easy to do a backup.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180226"></a>The reason is karma. God hears all your thoughts. When that thought pops into your head and you don't do a backup, or don't do it soon enough, He crashes your data, and you think "I should have done a backup when I thought of doing it." Even this doesn't please Him. At that moment it's even more urgent that you do a backup. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/30/144019.html#a180226" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144214"></a>My hippie uncle taught me this. God has a terrible sense of humor, and thinks it's really funny when you have a good thought and ignore it. When something didn't work he would say that's God goofing on me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/30/144019.html#a144214" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144248"></a>In this case, we're talking about is the Programmer God. There are all kinds of gods, a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html">baseball god</a>, a basketball god, and very specifically a Knicks god. That god has the absolutely worst sense of humor of them all and by worst I mean best. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/30/144019.html#a144248" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
