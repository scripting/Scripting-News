<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a181208"></a>Glossary: <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">Tiny Little Textbox</a>. (An idea I might try, coupled with <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22tiny%20little%20textbox%22">Daytona</a>, I should be able to build a glossary of terms I want in my official vocabulary. Ideas that have stood the test of time, that mean something now, but eventually will be set aside and no one will know what a TLTB was.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/27.html#a181208" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a114647"></a>The longest continuously updated <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> in the known universe.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a181311"></a>I'm working my way through <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-bear/season-4/">The Bear</a>, and it's great because you remember that you love all these characters and you can immediately start living the ongoing drama of their lives. I feel like a cat perched on a window watching everyone doing their daily stuff. Looking forward to going back to the beginning and starting over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/27.html#a181311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a181509"></a>BTW, I think the right way to read Scripting News is getting the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly email</a>. That's the pulse. I jot stuff down during the day, mostly in the morning, and later add links and finish stuff up. The scripting.com feed is updated in realtime. So you may get many versions of an item over the day, which might be a problem with feed readers that don't watch for changes. I noticed that my changes to a recent podcast <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">shownotes page</a> don't flow back out to my podcast client app on Android. <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> btw, records changes, and they flow through to the timeline. Coupled with <a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a>, which is supported in every WordPress site, makes the whole thing realtime. People assume that feeds have to perform like a feed reader. But if you have a component running on the open internet, hooked up via websockets to the client, you get the flow they get in twitter-like systems. And we didn't have to invent anything that didn't already exist in 2009.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/27.html#a181509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
