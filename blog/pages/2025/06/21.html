Keep it simple. This is one of the <a href="http://crimson1.scripting.com/dogma/2000">foundations</a> of blogging, btw.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142915"></a>Just a guess, but the people doing the "ice" raids are not real police any more than the "doge" people are/were actually part of the US government. In this New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-rise-and-fall-of-doge">podcast</a>, they dug into what "doge" actually was/is. Some weren't actually Trump supporters, they just thought it would be interesting to be empowered to fix the government. They learned the government doesn't work the way they thought it did. Spending is way up over the years, but number of government employees has stayed flat. It has already been largely privatized. Tangentially they appear to have found some things actually worth fixing. Tech culture isn't just the billionaires, far from it. There's a lot of hippie ethics in there too, you just have to look past the money, which seems too much work for some/most journalists. But The New Yorker tends to do this well, btw, sometimes. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/21.html#a142915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
