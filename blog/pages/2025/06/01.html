Another <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml">month gone</a>, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven't had a drink in months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen who isn't as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply "Let's go Mets!" I like that, though it will of course take me some time to get re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-highlight-jalen-josh-explain-why-the-yankees/id1729497779?i=1000710590814">his podcast</a> that New York has two teams, the Knicks (I agree) and the Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team without <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy">philosophy</a>. I'm not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change some things over the summer, and I've heard that they might try to get <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22kevin%20durant%22">Kevin Durant</a>. I sure hope not. I think the Knicks are benefiting from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/">the jinx</a> he put on himself when he tried in vain to stir up a "rivalry" between the Knicks and the Brooklyns. No, that isn't likely to happen, unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the butt like KD did. Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> will want him. That's about as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Portland,+OR/@41.7399086,-119.4458701,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6783853!2d45.515232!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">far</a> from New York as you can get in the NBA. And with that I now officially shut the door on the 2024-25 NBA season. We had a great run. See you all in October! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/01.html#a142901" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
