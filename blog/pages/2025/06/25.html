<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131617"></a>A <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/linkblogInBlogroll.png">preview</a> of how a WordLand linkblog works, which is of course a WordPress site, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/linkblogInBlogroll.png">viewed</a> in my blogroll. When I clicked on the link, I was surprised that it <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/trump-says-fudge-vulgarity-news/">goes to Poynter</a>, and not to the linkblog. But then I remembered that's the point of a linkblog. And it flows through to the feed, and the blogroll software understands. So now I have an end-to-end linkblog. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/25.html#a131617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a120451"></a>Another reason to love WordPress. Every freaking WordPress site had <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/feeds/">great RSS support</a>. They did more to keep feeds alive than anyone else. Google tried to kill RSS in a particularly humiliating way. WordPress kept it going.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/25.html#a120451" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195205"></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/nyregion/open-streets-new-york.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Rk8.6k8C.M00iQWY-xxEV&smid=url-share">A NYT article</a> from last year about 34th Ave in Jackson Heights where "a stretch of 26 blocks, running east to west, has been closed to cars from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day since 2020." Before we moved to Flushing when I was in 5th grade, we lived on 92nd St and 34th Ave. What a difference that must make. I love it when cities take chances like this, and the people in the neighborhood seem to love it.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/25.html#a195205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160702"></a>I tried an experiment, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/asfarasyoucango.png">go back</a> as far as I can in archive.org on scripting.com and see where it gets me. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961114163115/http://scripting.com/">first try</a> got me to a classified ads site I was experimenting with in mid-November 1996. A few weeks later, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224609/http://scripting.com/">December 3,</a> there was a colorful directory that took you to all the sub-sites on the server, DaveNet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a>, Classified ads, our Midas Website (Macintosh Internet Developers Association), DocServer, a BBS, and Guestbook.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/25/160652.html#a160702" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210525"></a>I went digging around in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/">Frontier</a> part. Lots of stuff there. By then we had been working on Frontier for eight years. It had been reborn once, from a Mac-focused single-user scripting environment to a networked one, all because the web had exploded and Apple didn't want us making system software for their platform. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/25/160652.html#a210525" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
