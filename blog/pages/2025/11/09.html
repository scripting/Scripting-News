<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235211"></a><a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> is one of the few products that works hard to make sure that it has effective competition. It lays out a welcome mat for competitors. That's what <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08.html#a152308">DemoLand</a> is all about. I think I finished it today, have to do another review, maybe two, before making it public. It is the opposite of a product that's meant to dominate. It's more like <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=macwrite">MacWrite</a>, to fill a niche as an invitation to others to come play. Remember in the web, all parts are replaceable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/09.html#a235211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
