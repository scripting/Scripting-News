If they do, our products will work on the same data, in Markdown of course. The user will get to use two different editors to work on the text. This is important because in the social network I'm imagining <i>every part is replaceable.</i> It takes work to make that real, but I have done the work. In this network the user will have choice of writing tools. Unlike products like Substack, for example, where you're forced to use their built-in editor. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08.html#a152308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141446"></a>I need to have my posts from <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> flow through the <a href="https://daveverse.org/">daveverse</a> site, because the WordPress view of my writing is becoming more important. I find myself copy/pasting again, and I have to start viewing every one of those as a bug to fix. That might be the biggest mess of all of them, the idea that humans are intended to do things that computers are meant to do <i>for</i> us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08.html#a141446" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's what it does. Reading a friend's email, I click the Reply button, and withouth me asking, it writes a reply for me. Thus, if I want to speak for myself first I have to delete the message it created in my name. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a140730" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140139"></a>I don't yet have words to describe how invasive, insubordinate and incestuous this is. It would be like going to a restaurant where they bring you your meal before taking your order? It's worse than that because I do my own writing, always, and forever. I'm not a Luddite, btw -- if you read my blog I try tech and I use it if it fits. I'm looking for new things tech can do. But this time I was forced to use something I never wanted to use. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a140139" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135131"></a>Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/08/googleSpeaksForMe.png?nodialog">screen shot</a> with a red arrow pointing to the AI's writing. Note that it also signs my name to its creation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a135131" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134843"></a>But it gets worse. They buried the opt-out settings, and they don't actually turn anything off. I asked ChatGPT how to do it. It showed me where the settings are, I turned them off, saved changes, reloaded the page, and the same suggestion is there. It's still speaking for me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a134843" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135202"></a>Now they certainly haven't rolled this feature out to journalists, because the news would be full of rage. Journalists, like other literate people, generally have the basic ability to speak for themselves. And journalists have a pulpit that Google is probably still a tiny bit scared of. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a135202" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135323"></a>Also, it's hard to come up with an example you can share publicly because it only does this with replies to emails from people you know. I tried it with spam-like messages and there it is willing to let you speak for yourself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a135323" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140643"></a>This raises a philosophical question for Google and its AI bot. Of what use are users? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/08/134542.html#a140643" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
