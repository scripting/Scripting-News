<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131304"></a>There was a time when I thought <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dick-cheney-dies-079591b529f048489650e7569bc675d2">Dick Cheney</a> was the worst possible person to be vice president of the United States. His corruption led to what we have now. I will never love his memory. But I do remember that he <a href="https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/dick-cheney-trump-kamala-harris-1484000">voted for Kamala Harris</a>. So, if you go deep enough, we shared the same vision for the country. As corrupt as he was, even he had a limit. We need more Republicans to do what he did. And I thank him for setting that example. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/11/04.html#a131304" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
