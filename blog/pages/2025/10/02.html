<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145232"></a>I have a problem in the development version of WordLand. Sometimes when I bring it to the front, there's an error deep in jQuery, an event has fired and the handler is pointing to a string or number, not a function. It dies, with no stack crawl, because it was responding to a focus event or blur or something like that. Something got overwritten. I have no idea where or how it happened, but once found it will be obvious. I've been trying to figure it out with Claude and ChatGPT and I can see it's going to take a few hours of concentration and learning to figure it out. But then I realized hey -- I bet I could use the Chrome debugger to find this problem. It has Gemini built in. It has access to the running code. I don't have to act as an intermediary, gathering data, pasting stuff into the AI bot. Now I'm looking forward to doing this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/02.html#a145232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I get a pointer. I can read it, and if I want, I can attach it to my post. The writing stays in your space, so you have an archive of all your writing. We let the web be the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/02.html#a145833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When you use the web instead of a silo you are helping build community outside, where free speech is the default. The more of us who communicate outside, the more people will be attracted. Your participation helps draw people out, where independent developers can create new tools for you without waiting for permission of big companies who own the network you're using. It's like voting. The more people do it, the stronger we all are. I've spent the last 31 years insisting on that freedom for myself as a writer and developer and sharing it with others. As people flocked to Twitter and Facebook, etc, you thought I was gone, finished, a loser. I know they think that about me. But honestly, I also knew the open internet would come back, because I knew its value, and I knew eventually the silos would reveal their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/500716650/donald-trump-clinches-the-presidency-in-major-upset">real cost</a>. They may appear free, but there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_salute_controversy">price to pay</a>. I hope you'll consider using the tools. If you want to get started, create a free site on wordpress.com. Just create it. That will be your home on the open social web. And btw, you don't have to agree with my politics to be part of it. That's kind of the whole point. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/02.html#a131238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

People say what theyâ€™re doing wonâ€™t work. I agree. But the elected Democrats swore an oath, to uphold the Constitution. With that constraint there isnâ€™t much they can do other than try to force the Repubs to do the same, and that isn't likely to work. It hasn't so far, but it's all they can do without breaking the Constitution themselves. Think about it. All these minds, and we haven't come up with anything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/02/143655.html#a143709" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143724"></a>What brought this home was a comment by a Democratic congressperson saying on CNN last night no matter what they do Trump wonâ€™t obey if he doesnâ€™t want to.

What do the pundits think they should do?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/02/143655.html#a143724" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
