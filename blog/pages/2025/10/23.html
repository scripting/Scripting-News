<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210203"></a>I'm really happy with the way <a href="https://wp.feedland.org/">WordPress News</a> is shaping up. Every community should have a news site like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23.html#a210203" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210652"></a>Also after last week's conference we're starting to get help from the open source developer community around WordPress. Really friendly people, excited about what we can all do together.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23.html#a210652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133122"></a>Tell the people who make AI's -- I want a way to have apps run in your browser that has direct connections to the AI engine, and it connects via the user's credentials, not the app devs (though you are entitled to know who the developer is). When I explored the idea of making apps for ChatGPT, this was the roadblock, I have to become a reseller of your service. Can't you figure out how to let the user pay directly? I just want to make tools, not be in the retail AI business. Feh.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/133525.html#a133122" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133630"></a>This is the same problem web devs have, we have to become resellers for Amazon S3. Why can't Amazon, who already has an account for every freaking person in the world, let the user own their own data, which I believe they would <i>reallllly</i> like. I don't want access to it, I just want to make great tools for them to use. And they're free to use other products with the data. This helps encourage data format standards. It's why the PC software market was so much more vibrant than the web developer market. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/133525.html#a133630" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133723"></a>I keep trying to explain this to people who aren't web devs, but in a position to help, and make a shitload of money, but all I get is blank stares, and "we don't do that."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/133525.html#a133723" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131809"></a>Yesterday I did some research into how weblogs.com, in 1999, tracked changes in the blogs it was following. This was a precursor to feed readers. There was a main output file called changes.xml,  a reverse chronological list of sites, not feeds, feeds didn't exist yet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/132104.html#a131809" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133015"></a>You can <a href="https://chatgpt.com/c/68f8f563-0ab8-8322-865a-af0cc88fa35a">ask ChatGPT</a> to tell you about changes.xml. I did, it was able to put together all the random bits that are now gone, it found them somewhere and I got a much better answer than I would have gotten if somehow all my docs had survived, and most of them did not. This btw is one of the great features of ChatGPT. Truly a miracle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/132104.html#a133015" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

Sometimes these links don't work for everyone. I wish they would get that working, dear friends at OpenAI. This is how your word of mouth builds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/23/132104.html#a134139" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
