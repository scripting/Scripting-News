<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140456"></a>I have to remember to <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/10/19/what-i-did-on-my-trip-to-canada-part-1/">use WordLand</a> to post <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org">to Mastodon</a>, because when I go in that way, I don't have a character limit and I can use styling. We were wrestling with this question at WC, how to market the feature in a way that would get people to go to WordPress to write for Mastodon. It would also be cool if you could turn on the ActivityPub connection in WordLand, without having to wade through all the menus and dialogs. Imagine if we had a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/19/activityPubDialog.png">confirmation dialog</a> like this in WordLand.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/19.html#a140456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133939"></a>I have a really interesting idea for Netflix. Do a MCP so I can ask ChatGPT to find a show I'd probably like on Netflix. Then Hulu would have to hook up too, and HBO and Apple and everyone else. That would fix a big entertainment problem because I've already taught ChatGPT exactly what I like in movies and serials by giving it all my favorite shows and why I liked them so much. This was the idea of Bingeworthy, which I never seem to find time to work on. I really just want the freaking functionality. Someone should buy Metacritic btw, their process, however it works, is really good at finding the good stuff. But please someone who believes in open APIs, it totally needs to be in the Chativerse.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/19.html#a133939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132917"></a>I presented <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> for the first time publicly, the new one with a timeline, so it more clearly shows how we can build a beautiful social network just from open formats and protocols. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/19/132911.html#a132917" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133454"></a>No user lock-in, every part replaceable, and open to developers to add functionality without having to reimplement the whole thing. These are all the things I think that have stood in the way of innovation in the web for many years.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/19/132911.html#a133454" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133407"></a>A social network that starts out with no centralization and open in every sense has a much better chance of being decentralized than one that starts out centralized and swears they're going to stop doing that -- someday, fingers crossed, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/19/132911.html#a133407" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
