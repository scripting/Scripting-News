<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140609"></a>I'm back at <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp</a> in a big room waiting for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a> to answer questions for the people here. Yesterday's presentation went really well, lots of smart people really interested, fantastic discussion after. A very nice web culture. I went with three slides to get started, and then talked, demo'd, answered questions, and listened to ideas. Told a few jokes. Got a few laughs. It got the job done, help feed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-of-mouth_marketing">word of mouth</a> on <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/17.html#a140609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
