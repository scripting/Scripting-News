	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140505"></a>I changed the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/26/deBlasioPolice.png?nodialog">header graphic</a> on Scripting News today to raise a question with NYC voters. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/140248.html#a140505" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145034"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio">Bill de Blasio</a> was mayor. A funeral for two murdered cops. The police stand at attention, their <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/26/deBlasioPolice.png?nodialog">backs turned</a> on the mayor. This was a statement about him for sure, but even more about their disdain for the people who elected him, you and me, the people they're sworn to protect. I grew up in NY, and had plenty of experience with NY cops and this kind of disrespect is, from my point of view, who they are. I know they see themselves as martyrs, that's what the demonstration meant. But they also have a job to do and a chain of command.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/140248.html#a145034" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140807"></a>There's a lot of pent up resentment and you can't just wish it away. The mayor, for better or worse, owns it. I can't imagine they'd have much respect for the Democratic Party nominee. Like it or not, this is the city NYers live in. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/140248.html#a140807" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145641"></a>I am old enough to remember when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay">John Lindsay</a>, a liberal Republican, back when there were such things, was the newly elected mayor in 1966 and was greeted by a transit strike, shutting down subways and buses. The unions walked all over him. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/140248.html#a145641" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140848"></a>I think NYC and NYers will fare better with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>. This isn't the first time I've stood up for him <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo">on this blog</a>. He resigned in disgrace, humiliated, but I never will forget his leadership during the darkest times of Covid. Cuomo, along with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr">Donald McNeil</a> at the NY Times and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci">Dr Anthony Fauci</a> were the bright beams of intelligence and compassion.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/140248.html#a140848" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134236"></a><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-house-of-dynamite/">House of Dynamite</a> is a fantastic movie, it deserved the great reviews it's getting, and I found it easy to watch, though a lot of reviewers said it wasn't. It's exactly the kind of movie I like -- political thriller with ideas rich with intrigue. Great acting and writing. It's the 2025 version of Fail Safe. Both are like stage play, but this one examines the story from all angles, very skillfully, so the story is told iteratively. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/141114.html#a134236" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141227"></a>The president in this story is throughtful and deliberative with no time to think. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/141114.html#a141227" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141348"></a>It's provocative because the person who would make that choice <i>now</i> just destroyed part of the most famous building in the country on a whim, presumably to show us he has the power to destroy things, which you will not doubt even slightly when you watch House of Dynamite. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/141114.html#a141348" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141443"></a>As you watch the movie, hold the thought in the back of your mind. What would Trump do. There was a time when we chose presidents based on our willingness them to have them decide whether or not to launch the nukes. We lost that perspective, but the problem never went away. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/26/141114.html#a141443" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
