<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a013446"></a>On my drive to Ottawa and back, I never had to wait for a charger, and it never took more than 1/2 hour to fill the battery to 80%. The chargers are often in places with restaurants or supermarkets. And it's good for my legs to get out of the car and walk for a bit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/20.html#a013446" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142014"></a>Frontier's <a href="http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/simpleCrossNetworkScript.html">Simple Cross-Network Scripting</a> is one of my favorite features ever.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134102"></a>I wish WordPress had a "home" social network. The community is all over the place, on Twitter, Slack, Masto, Bluesky, GitHub, and probably a few other places. I hope to have a social network that is built on WordPress and RSS. It would be open to the public, and anyone could start their own, by running an easy to install piece of software on a server. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/20.html#a134102" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
