<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133943"></a>People are surprised that I'm trying to build the for-real social web as opposed to the aspirational social web. It <i>does</i> require a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah">chutzpah</a>. I feel that. Sometimes I put off doing things because while the coding is simple and straightforward, the immensity of it overwhelms me a bit. I don't remember feeling that way the first time around, possibly because we were doing it all step by step over approx ten years. Now it's all compressed into weeks. I know how to do it, and I've got or built the pieces I needed. But it just doesn't somehow feel right that the idea is actually becoming a thing. "This can't be happening." But we live in that kind of time. Who knows what monsters lie within. We may find out. Heh. Maybe that's where the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68dfd79b-ab24-8012-86b6-d7941c09f02a">goosebumps</a> come from. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/03.html#a133943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144323"></a>With the advent of AI code development tools, maybe we should embark on a project to merge all programming languages into one syntax. To undo all the chaos and make humans more competitive with machines. The fact that there are so many development bubbles is a huge waste of resources. Makes us all net-net more stupid. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/03.html#a144323" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145934"></a>I lived in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Menlo Park, Berkeley, Los Gatos and Woodside over 31 years and I did nothing to fix the problem either. My answer was to move to NYC where the transit system is pretty great. Then I moved to the mountains and got a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tesla">Tesla</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/03/145920.html#a145934" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145935"></a>BTW, the idea that the stars of Silicon Valley should run the world is not new. I first heard about it from Apple top level managers in the 1980s. They were not techno-fascists, but they did hugely overestimate what it takes to run the world, or even a small country in Africa. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/03/145920.html#a145935" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
