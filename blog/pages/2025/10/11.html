If you're interested, that's where I've been while I'm shaking out core bugs in the new WordLand. These are the things I want to stay fixed and never have to screw with again. It does actually work that way in products that go through a shake-out process. <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> and <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> both work pretty well. Sure there are bugs and things I wish worked differently, but I and a few other people use them as everyday tools. I'm trying to get WordLand with its timeline function to be that way. A bunch of new hookups via HTTP and Websockets. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/11.html#a150646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
