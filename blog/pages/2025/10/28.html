<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194324"></a>I checked out Elon Musk's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">answer</a> to Wikipedia by going to the pages on <a href="https://grokipedia.com/page/Wikipedia">his site</a> that Wikipedia mangles the most, in my experience. It looks like they basically copied Wikipedia, if so it's no better or worse. They'll probably be able to improve it, because ChatGPT tells a much closer to actual-events story. Net-net getting the story right is more important imho than keeping democracy open to trolls. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/28.html#a194324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
