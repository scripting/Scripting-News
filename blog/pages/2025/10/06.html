There must be a way to monetize that. For example, I want to buy a new backpack to carry my laptop and other mobile stuff. I should be able to set up anywhere there's wifi. I've got a modern MacBook Air, an iPad and two phones, one iOS and one Android. The main one is Android, I have to carry the iPhone because I use an Apple watch. I imagine there must be some improvements made in backpacks since I bought the last one, which was when I lived in Berkeley, in the late 00s.

Focus on goals and help others help us achieve them. It's a virtuous cycle, because once people figure out that they can get help by helping us, they will help us more. That is, when it works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/06.html#a210527" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141525"></a>Reason #29812 you know our current writing system is broken. When you want to post something that has more than the maximum characters they post an image instead of the text. I once wasted a few months making a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=pngwriter">writing tool</a> for those kinds of posts, hoping that if it caught on we could have a shadow network that moved the actual text around the net between users.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/10/06.html#a141525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
