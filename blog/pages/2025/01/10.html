Here's <a href="https://my.bingeworthy.org/?username=scripting">my profile page</a>. This is how you share recommendations.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172317"></a>Good <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316#issuecomment-2583279043">questions</a> from Phil Jones re Wednesday's podcast. I'm glad to get to answer these questions. There's more to wpIdentity than is obvious at first glance, for example it has a relatively complete storage system built in for developers to use. I used one of its features yesterday in the connection between Bingeworthy and the profile display app. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10.html#a172317" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151801"></a>BTW, I'm going through all the episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a>, and find it's influencing how I write. A good bingewatch is like that. You become one of the characters, or in a way, all of them. Sometimes I'm Swearingen and other times I'm Wu. Etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10.html#a151801" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150143"></a>We need an AI chatbot that can work with GitHub repos. That is, in my prompt I say, the following questions are about this GitHub repo. At that point it is ready to answer any question about the project. This an incredibly important intersection of capabilities. As far as I can tell, GitHub doesn't offer it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10/150635.html#a150143" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150654"></a>Anticipating that people will suggest I use their editor, I don't want to use their freaking editor. This keeps coming up everywhere. You can't use this or that unless you use their editor. Insidious form of lock-in. And it also limits their market to people who use their editor. Shortsighted and stupid. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10/150635.html#a150654" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150717"></a>We need to start thinking about choice. If it applies to developers, it's more likely they will follow through in the designs of their own projects and give their users choice as a matter of principle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10/150635.html#a150717" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150725"></a>I'd also like to use a chatbot that incorporates the philosophy of the open web. They have opinions btw. One of the first things Claude.ai does when I give it some JavaScript code is that they "modernize" it. That is also insidious. I choose which constructs I use carefully, and follow the rule that one way to do something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10/150635.html#a150725" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150744"></a>The bots can be bullies because the companies that make them are tech companies and thus shortcuts to make money, and thus handicap their users. Maybe the users are starting to figure this out. One can hope. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/10/150635.html#a150744" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
