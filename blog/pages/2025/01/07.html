I've started using names like "comment1" etc to shoehorn comments in. A complete hack, impossible to maintain over time. The idea of not being able to put notes in your config.json files is absolutely ridiculous. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07.html#a143741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165102"></a>I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing with ten years ago. And they could have removed features from the language instead of piling on more and more random reinventions. End of editorial, now on with the new Bingeworthy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07.html#a165102" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161832"></a>Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all of a sudden new items started appearing in the <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">the new Bingeworthy</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a161832" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164457"></a>I thought oh geez there's some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but quickly realized <i>someone was using it</i> and <i>it was working. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a164457" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164103"></a>There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with first, and I wanted to fix up the <a href="https://this.how/bingeworthy/">docs</a>, such as they are, but I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the TwitterPocalypse. <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a> is the app I missed the most that hadn't been ported off Twitter identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a164103" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162218"></a>Here's what you're getting.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a162218" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162223"></a>I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a162223" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162258"></a>The most important features are there, although they don't necessarily look that great. I want to do some more work there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a162258" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162327"></a>The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a162327" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162435"></a>If you have any questions or problems, I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315">thread</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a162435" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162516"></a>It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> on the Mac in the 90s. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a162516" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164825"></a>BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There's a slight typo, but rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to find. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/07/162200.html#a164825" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
