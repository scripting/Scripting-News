Here's the deal. You need a place to write a posts and a way to read a timeline of posts. That's the basic functionality. To do that with RSS you would start with a blogging app like WordPress, and a feed reader like FeedLand or NetNewsWire. Manton has integrated the two into a single user interface at <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>. I'm going to approach it in a somewhat differently, not sure yet how it will work, but I'm getting there. And I will offer a way for people to hook in any feed reader they want, thus opening up innovation to tech-curious users. The take-away is that you need to handle inbound and outbound feeds. That's the basics of being twitter-like. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/19.html#a141521" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In the previous piece the idea was interop. I tried to think of what images I've used in the past, then I thought why don't I just look. I switched into Daytona, entered <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>, and found <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png">one</a> I loved, but then kept scanning, and found <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png">another</a> that I liked even more. Tools are important. Web writers haven't gotten any new tools in a long time. All the tool development has been for other stuff. Let's make tools for users again, as we did in the olden times. Craftwork in software. Playin in the band! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/19.html#a142805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”
