It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png">wrote</a> and edited a <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/">complete blog post</a>, a response to something <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds">Krugman wrote</a>, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso">Marge said</a> at the end of Fargo. "There's more to life than a little money, you know." It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper">wood chipper</a>. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/01.html#a155912" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
