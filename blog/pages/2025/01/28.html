It wouldn’t be hard to make the Repubs look like Scrooges. Get people riled up. Another ad, about the people Trump pardoned and what they’re doing now. Wait till one of them commits a major crime and run <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/vignette/willy-horton-attack-ad/4495693">Willie Horton</a> style ads. Make it understood who these people actually are. Trump has to own each and every one of them. This really isn’t hard. But the Dems think campaigns end. They don’t end. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28.html#a014105" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a015325"></a>Another ad. Donald Trump on Mt Rushmore. Donald Trump on the $20 bill. The Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial renamed Trump. Kennedy airport in NYC renamed Trump International. In the future the US will have only one founding father: Donald J. Trump.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28.html#a015325" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222819"></a>I thought this excerpt from <a href="https://contrarian.substack.com/p/departing-the-new-york-times">Krugman's piece</a> about his move back to blogging was right on. "For a while I tried to make up for the loss of the blog with threads on Twitter. But even before Elon Musk Nazified the site, tweet threads were an awkward, inferior substitute for blog posts." There's a need for a system that combines the full-featured writing of blogging and the timelines of twitter-like systems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28.html#a222819" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130346"></a>And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped support for the api?

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130429"></a>We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are repeating the mistakes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28/130324.html#a130429" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130436"></a>The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way twitter's was.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28/130324.html#a130436" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130603"></a>This started as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a> on Bluesky of course. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28/130324.html#a130603" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130628"></a>PS: Spoiler -- Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not billionaire-proof. It's going to get acquired, it probably already has, based on what they're doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do, not what they say. It's just as true in tech as it is in politics, and these days, what's the difference anyway? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28/130324.html#a130628" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132658"></a>PPS: If you're thinking ahh but there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too. It didn't make a difference. And AT Proto won't either unless there are proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky's servers, so those users can't be sold to the billionaire. We're nowhere near that. No one can say with any certainty that it's even possible. At this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it and the users and developers would have no recourse. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/28/130324.html#a132658" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171922"></a>PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn't take $20 million each for their share?
