My <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lgibxvpz3k2x">post</a> about never forgetting Trump's coup attempt has already been RT'd 2.8K times, about three hours after it was posted. In all my years of using the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22">social web</a> I've never gotten that much attention. I have 11.7K followers, far fewer than I have on Twitter. By 5PM it had been RT'd 10K times.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/24.html#a140208" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141506"></a>Objectively, January 6, 2021 was even more of a "day which will live in infamy" than the Japanese attack on <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/pearl-harbor-december-7-1941">Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941.   It was more insidious because while Hawaii was an American territory, January 6 was an attack on the actual center of our government. Had the mob prevailed, the US would have been defeated, there and then. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/24/140444.html#a141506" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
