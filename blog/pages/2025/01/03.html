	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a014612"></a><a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds">Krugman writes</a> about social media is poisoning children's minds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a014612" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I like that Krugman has resumed his blogging. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>This means that sometimes I agree or disagree, or have mixed opinions, but I always learn something. That's what makes a blogger good imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a014750"></a>I don't know if I agree that children's minds are being poisoned. But I am pretty sure when people like Krugman and myself reach a certain age, and we are the same age, we start looking at new media that way. Maybe <i>our</i> minds are poisoned. My father called television the "idiot box." But it eventually became the literature of my generation, often very good. But maybe laws can help.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a014750" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a015041"></a>One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a015041" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a014841"></a>Same with the NFL, MLB and tennis. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a014841" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a015228"></a>And is this why they can now afford to <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-agrees-to-contract-with-mets">sign players</a> to $765 million contracts? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a015228" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>They're all getting hugely rich, but I believe that they are certainly doing great harm to the new sports fans growing up now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a024729"></a>I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a024729" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a014633"></a>I was a math major and a 50+ year programmer, and I know that if you gamble enough you lose all your money. And as an addiction no gambler ever gets up from the table to enjoy their winnings when they win.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a014633" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
