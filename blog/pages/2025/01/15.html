It's deployed, scaled, widely supported, far beyond AT Proto or ActivityPub. It's the HTML of the open social web. And where the others are complicated, feeds are really simple. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/15.html#a142124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155411"></a>Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://x.com/photomatt/status/1878809636750721323">said</a> something provocative on Twitter two days ago that I'm just tuning into now. "The lawsuits will go years and could potentially bankrupt me or force the closure of WordPress.org." I <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1879556640455712964">commented</a> on it as a developer who views WordPress as a platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/15.html#a155411" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When I hear a reporter wondering what to make of his thing about all those friendly countries he wants to go to war with, here's what it means. He's <a href="http://this.how/trolls/">trolling</a> you. Haven't you figured that out by now. Just by mentioning the weird thing he's talking about as if it were some kind of puzzle, a brilliant chess move, etc blah blah zzzz. It's trolling. Stop falling for it. If it's Trump-initiated nonsense, don't report it. You. Are. Being. Trolled. Asshole. All he wants is attention. Always. No exceptions.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/15.html#a185705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
