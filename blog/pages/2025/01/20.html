<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/12/23/sarahLynn.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174042"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/12/23/sarahLynn.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I just wrote a review for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_(TV_series)">Industry</a> in <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, but it doesn't have a text editor. It farms the job off to <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, which shoots the text back to Bingeworthy as the user publishes to WordPress and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in Markdown. So the text is on both BW and WP and the <a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a>. And through WordPress it has a <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/industry-was-great-until-the-end/">presence on the web</a>. This is the goal, writing exists on its own, but can be shared in all the contexts it makes sense in, but it lives primarily in your blog, your home base. That's why WordPress is so important in the scheme of things. It's a consensus, this is where a lot of people are blogging in 2025. And there's a lot of mostly unexplored interop. And they don't break developers. This may not make total sense at this time, but soon, I hope to be able to point back at this post, and say it was the first time something important worked. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/20.html#a174042" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174623"></a>BTW, actually the term <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> is probably too big a compromise. The "web" part is the only part that's imho useful. The sad part is that "social" means "we removed most of the features of the web." Why? Some vague sense that people would write too much if given the space. Or link too much. Or edit too much. Or be too emphatic. It's worse than Disneyfied -- at least at Disneyland you get actors, and color and rides, and bland food with tons of sugar and fat. But there is some fun and nutrition. In the social web, it's just memes and slogans. Not even much room for a metaphor. There's so much more to say about being human.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/20.html#a174623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was a one-line change to make it work again, which, sigh, is necessary now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/20.html#a191451" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Our office was on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Elwell+Ct,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94303/@37.4320011,-122.1062105,1048m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fba3f1e2d0db3:0x2fd030af404448b3!8m2!3d37.4320011!4d-122.1036356!16s%2Fg%2F1tgb__w0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">Elwell Court</a> in Palo Alto, just off 101, near the golf course and airport. Pam was managing editor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">BYTE</a>, the class act of tech pubs in the early personal computer business, then editor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Computing">Popular Computing</a>, the magazine for the people (ie users of computers). When she was at BYTE, her office was on the same floor as ours. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/20/150120.html#a151444" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150211"></a>The tech industry was rough even then, all the young egos, people who were sure they could do everything, not much collaboration, lots of betrayal. She was one of the few people I could talk with on a personal level, with trust and intelligence. We talked about the future of the technology we were creating, and what we wanted from all this. She was a mentor, like a big sister, best friend, someone I trusted and loved. A very rare friendship. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/01/20/150120.html#a150211" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150237"></a>Our paths crossed again a few years ago on Facebook.
