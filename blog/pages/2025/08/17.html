It's hot and muggy, but I am where you want to be this time of year, in the Catskill Mountains, where there's lots to do outdoors, the peaches are fantastic right now, apples coming soon. I'm working a few hours a day on the integration of writing and timelines built around feeds. Instead of using Bluesky or Mastodon, with their limits, we use WordPress for storage. It has none of their limits, has a high performance open source server back-end, debugged complete API, it's not without problems, but far ahead of where the competition is in terms are reliablity and ease of implementation. <i>To be part of this network, all you need is an RSS feed. </i>Seems pretty openly billionaire-proof wouldn't you say. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/17.html#a143233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
