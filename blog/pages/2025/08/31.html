<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145843"></a>There are two quotes that make me laugh in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">Think Different</a> piece from last week. One of them is <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#:~:text=They%20took%20paradise%20and%20blew%20big%20holes%20in%20it%20that%20users%20couldn't%20find%20a%20way%20out%20of.">here</a>: "They took paradise and.." At first, if you're roughly my age, you read "They took paradise and..." and recognize it as the beginning of a famous line from Joni Mitchell's <a href="https://genius.com/Joni-mitchell-big-yellow-taxi-lyrics">Big Yellow Taxi</a>. The other is a subtle touch of sarcasm, that I usually try not to indulge in, but let pass through as I edited this piece. See if you can <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">find</a> it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/31.html#a145843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150631"></a>Mea culpa: Unfortunately I misquoted Joni, she said "paved" not "took."

The Supremes gave him four years to prepare, to learn from his mistakes, now he'll do it from the top seat.

And the Mets, my team since 1962, are really exciting right now, after a month of being lost. They have great rookie pitchers who are full of youthful enthusiasm and they kick ass on the mound. They have veterans who understand their job is to lead and they take that responsibility seriously, and they get on base, steal bases, and hit home runs. And they have workaday athletes who get on base when the team needs a hit. And the most expensive player ever in any sport who's finally playing as part of the team and not someone who misses the old team he used to play on. And they still have the most ridiculously dorky mascot, a caricature of a human with a baseball for a head, and his wife who also has a baseball for a head. Where do they come up with these ideas? Doesn't matter it's the M-E-T-S of New York town who we will now step right up to meet, and greet.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/31/123445.html#a123451" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
