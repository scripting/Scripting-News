<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214214"></a><a href="https://news.scripting.com/">news.scripting.com</a> continues to grow. There must be some word of mouth. Or perhaps people are refreshing it more often. I have no analytics except for a hit counter. Maybe I should do a little work on the site. Let me <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/327">know</a> if you have any feature requests. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/27.html#a214214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

On the web seemed relatively easy. But of the web is a bit more elusive. Until <a href="https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601">Ken Smith</a> found <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way">this quote</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> in the original 1989 proposal by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for what would become the web. "Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way." I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for <a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">weblog</a>, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is "unconstrained." If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/27.html#a132949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Kind of like Robin Williams, from the planet you come from, but he's a centipede and only breathes what you would think of as Chef Boyardee lasagna, but it's not really that, it's different. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/27/143916.html#a145325" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145832"></a>Anyway, he's old, 757 centuries give or take, and they're expecting him to die soon, and they can elect someone boring so they can forget about politics.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145909"></a>And then one day he does die, and everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief, until later that night, on the 10-screen equivalent of what you would think of as TV, hilarity ensues when the "dead" PM showed up, looking fit, young and dashing, doing slapstick and talking about how he's going to make a mess of something. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/27/143916.html#a145909" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

Everyone was pissed, but mostly agreed the PM was still pretty funny.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/27/143916.html#a145947" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
