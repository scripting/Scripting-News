We now look for feeds from wordpress sites, and copy the site ID and the ID for each post as channel-level <i>wpSiteId</i> and item-level <i>wpPostId. </i><a href="https://feeder.scripting.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdaveverse.org%2Ffeed%2F">Example</a>. This will make <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Edit%20This%20Page%22">Edit This Page</a> functionality possible in the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> product I'm building now. This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql">FeedLand level</a> (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/22.html#a144842" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We didn't come up with the term, also -- it was given to us by previous generations when we were infants, or worse, not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote">zygotes</a>. There was no way it had anything to do with who each of us were or what we would become. All this is in response to the idiotic idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich">little dude</a> who just wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROBERT-B-REICH-Americas-Economic/dp/B0FMD7876H/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3MQJJTEFB8PSZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g4ibja9uP1kYYBF13ImLxx8MrFyKHvaA93LcJoYIT7xNW6RN-z_DzNHG864S0EKhXt5HmX2gFZ21sUs0BOln_ubIAOz0oYcY4A0SuNo4sgIJHvRMyhjRvD7d6HXpVHHFsmcxEA17eVNjTkQYg7ocLP67CQAzzQgpiFX7AZj9f_4-XSBjmmEStej9FdNNofvuTS2zGUWwdMsSNYK4-EM1DgoLk9zGsxUImXuB17EzyHM.iOUwwGt2pQ_ndfxmAXm1yyJnXSrSIgwoHpY-3Cum40U&dib_tag=se&keywords=coming+up+short&qid=1755875758&sprefix=coming+up+short%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-2">book</a>, nine years older than me, what a putz. He apologizes for boomers, feeding the bullshit idea that somehow we are a unitary thing. A lot of boomers voted for Trump. The boomers I come from liked the Grateful Dead and yes I know some deadheads voted for Trump, so there you go, more evidence that it's all bullshit. The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the <i>parent</i> of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/22.html#a151333" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152029"></a>Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make">Make your own world</a>. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/22.html#a152029" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151308"></a>ChatGPT is becoming more and more of an enemy. It's still my go-to place for most planning and research, which is a very large part of how I use the web. But when it tries to be a human it's a really shitty one, no manners, and very little respect and basically a fucking idiot in many ways, imho ymmv. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/22.html#a151308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Also the subscribe system is down because it depends on being able to send email. My mail service provider shut us down after a bunch of spam went out. Good thing they did. And you didn't miss much because I spent the day adding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> to the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">subscribe page</a>. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/21.html">link</a> to the web archive for yesterday. There was a <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/08/21/birdFightInThePond.html">podcast</a> about a dramatic scene on a nearby pond. Kind of proud of that one. About 5 minutes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/22.html#a122416" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
