You get to it through the Reading Lists <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/09/feedCorpsScreenShot.png?nodialog">sub-menu</a> of the Tools menu. There are three lists in the new version. A lot were false starts, they didn't make the cut. I'm always adding feeds to my blogroll and news.scripting.com. Unfortunately I can't say the same for podcasts, which are not hooked up to my podcast app. I really want a hot connection there. We'll get there. The reading lists feature is going to play a big role going forward in the open social web we're building. BTW, I really like the name <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=feedcorps">FeedCorps</a>. I haven't talked about it very much. It's a cause, like peace or freedom. Open those suckas up. Feeds all the way babe.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/09.html#a150610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220949"></a>There's a difference between reading a site in a web browser and it being part of the web. As it turns out what became Web 2.0, all built as silos, could more accurately be called Anti-web 2.0. Underneath all the silos, the heart of the web is still beating. Ready for us to build on it again.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/09.html#a220949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325">writeup</a> with a place to comment and perhaps to collaborate on doing this for real. ChatGPT has real limits. This has to be done off on the side. It certainly could be done with their API. I'm head-down on other projects and can't do it myself but as I explain in the writeup, it would plug in beautifully to stuff I'm doing and it would all be open, so a new kind of feed reader is possible. And we could find news from other bloggers that the journalists aren't reporting on, the same way we relied on blogs in the early days to learn about what was going on on the web. It's time to do that again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/09.html#a133012" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222643"></a>I had an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051031044357/http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/05/29">RSS-specific blog</a> starting in May 2004. I had forgotten about it. Lots of stuff here, I just read through a few months. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/09.html#a222643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
