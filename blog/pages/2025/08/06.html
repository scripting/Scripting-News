I went to one of them, signed up for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test">the test</a> mostly to get out of school for a day, and got in. Back in those days (the early 70s) no one studied for the test as far as I know. It has become very competitive and there's an issue of the racial makeup of the student body. As always Lehrer does a great podcast. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/06.html#a204326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

That's why I spruced up <a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a>, that's how we're connecting our servers. He's building this stuff to flow into his LLM via the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket">FeedLand websockets interface</a>. He'll be updated on my subscriptions, and have his own, and the news will flow into his AI system. All of it can emanate from anywhere RSS is supported with a focus on WordPress. It's the secret sauce. ðŸ˜€ <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/06.html#a204222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
