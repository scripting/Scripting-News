<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152517"></a>Welcome to August. More than half the summer is behind us. We're still here. The shelves in the supermarkets are full of good stuff. We've had about the normal amount of hot weather, a good amount of rain but not too much. The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/mets/standings/">Mets</a> are doing OK. They opened a <a href="https://www.tibetphowoodstock.com/">Pho restaurant</a> in Bearsville and it's good. Health, not too bad, all things considered. <i>Still diggin!</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/01.html#a152517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
