<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132336"></a>I want a new ChatGPT mode where I drive the work, not the bot. I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions. I call this "behave like a computer, not a human." Because it's a fanstastic computer, but not a good partner.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/16.html#a132336" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
