I still want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests of one person (me). My <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706">query</a> is this: "Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information.." The response was basically: "I'm sorry Dave." Groan. Here are <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482">the details</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/12.html#a120432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I probably will keep coming back to this until I break through. Or maybe hook up with another developer who can back into the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket">websocket hose</a> coming out of FeedLand. It's a natural thing to hook up to AI systems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/12.html#a161728" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
