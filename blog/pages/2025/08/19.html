<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154245"></a>I've been building around WordPress to create a social network based on RSS. I want to get out of being controlled by billionaire-owned sites. I have a feeling we may need a good <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22billionaire-proof%22">backup</a> given where we are now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/19.html#a154245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151447"></a>The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesnâ€™t take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/">$170 billion</a> to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/19.html#a151447" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152357"></a>I had an idea that <a href="https://globalvoices.org/">Global Voices</a>, at least in concept, could help us prepare in the US for what's coming. I wrote: I'd love to have is an <b>idea-sharing network</b> where i could drop this idea in a box named "helping the US stay free" and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying "if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!" That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/19.html#a152357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
