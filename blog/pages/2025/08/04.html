Lay it all out there, stop spinning all the crazy fascist authoritarianism as both-sides and normal partisan politics. They know we're in a lot deeper. Since we're now paying the bills, how about plain facts.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04.html#a161932" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It has nothing to do with my feelings. I don't have feelings about computers. It lied to me over and over just now. I said you're lying to me. "I understand why you feel that way." As if it were the all-knowing feeling-inferring god-like creature it is not. The real question for me is this -- Does Open AI program it to be this way. Think about the opportunities it has to introduce true feelings of insecurity and worthlessness. That's the purpose of gaslighting. It's evil. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04.html#a140042" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143322"></a>Academics, who speak scientific language, won't say "there's no antisemitism at UCLA" because they know that's not true. Antisemitism is everywhere. The question is how limiting and dangerous is it. And how often is it encountered. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a143322" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143406"></a>I grew up in the 1960s in a Queens neighborhood where antisemitism was a real thing. We were blamed for World War II. If it weren't for Jews my uncle Pete would still be alive. That was the story. No doubt the kids heard that at home. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a143406" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143439"></a>Antisemitism was bred into us at home. Because of all the abuse my parents and grandparents, uncles and cousins, suffered in Europe, before coming the US during the war, their own idea of what it meant to be Jewish was not entirely positive. You can't help but feel responsible in some ways for the abuse you suffer. And you can't help but pass that on to your kids. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a143439" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143511"></a>There was and is a fair amount of pain associated with being Jewish in the United States. Fact.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a143511" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143516"></a>But: At UCLA? Harvard? Columbia? Please.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a143516" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143532"></a>At the same time scientists can admit that there is antisemitism at these places we must also acknowledge that to single these institutions out among all, is complete utter total fucking bullshit.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a143532" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144033"></a>Antisemitism is complex. We should be hearing, openly, what exactly the case is against these universities. The government is theoretically representing the Constitution and the people of the United States. The old "no taxation without representation" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation">thing</a>. Let's hear the case in clear terms, and why the universities are supposedly so bad. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/04/143315.html#a144033" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
