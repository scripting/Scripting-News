<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141205"></a>My mother would have been 93 years old today. She died in 2018, seven years ago. As time goes by, I feel her importance in my life more and more. I find I didn't have a realistic perspective in the living years. But more than any other person in my life, she shaped me -- for better or worse, but mostly better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20.html#a141205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142236"></a>Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html#a142236" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
