<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215348"></a>A <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/08/05/justAnswerTheQuestionPleaseDearChatgpt.html">podcast</a> I recorded this morning, prime time, while getting things done, and having ChatGPT getting in the way. It needs to become more invisible, there's no suspension of disbelief when you're working with it. I think we can do much better at finding a robot that can really augment human intelligence. This is awful stuff. We have to work on these dynamics. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/05.html#a215348" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a205027"></a>Whenever you have to get something done with a company, get ready for lots of phone tag, waiting on hold, talking to bots, getting screened, trying to convince a computer that you have legitimate business, and no, what you're looking for isn't on their website (believe me I looked). The stupid thing about it is that ChatGPT is becoming more like those things every day. Companies have built awful systems for getting anything done that might eat into their profits. Google is the absolute worst. Even for services that cost real money, they absolutely will not help. You better hope everything goes perfectly if you buy their service. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/05.html#a205027" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
