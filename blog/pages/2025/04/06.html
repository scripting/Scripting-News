I think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom. What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that it isn't so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and asked it to write up a <a href="https://this.how/claudewiki/">proposal for ClaudeWiki</a>, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run, make it part of a user's $20 per month subscription. I think it would be useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its service. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/06.html#a170408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam, people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/06.html#a163805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163543"></a>BTW, when you post something on Bluesky it's just a tweet. These things don't need different names on each platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/06.html#a163543" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163058"></a>I like people who stand up and speak the truth. This is one of the silver linings of this crisis. There's no real advantage at this point in trying to play it safe, to not be noticed. So I like what Chris Murphy, Senator from Connecticut has been saying. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/06.html#a163058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162836"></a>I used to tell friends you can't go wrong buying the S&P 500. The president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long haul you can expect steady growth from the S&P 500, and it keeps things really simple. Well, have to say -- that's no longer good advice. Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don't know. It depends on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are listening. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/06.html#a162836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
