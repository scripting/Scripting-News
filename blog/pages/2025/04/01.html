I was paying attention to copyright issues in software at the time, we used copy protection, but we knew it didn't work. It was just how things were done.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/01.html#a111248" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There's a point of view reflected in its creations, looking into a soul that in no way exists. We're learning about it, but it's a moving target, evolving before our eyes, in huge steps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/01.html#a104129" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a103900"></a>My server has been coughing up hairballs tonight. It coughed up a link to <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html">this piece</a> from two years ago, when Twitter pulled the plug on their API. It knocked everything I had built on the Twitter API off the air. Every thing. Just like that. That's what tonight was like here. It was just some of my apps, suddenly, not working. Whew. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/01.html#a103900" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was a big scramble, I had to provision a new server on Digital Ocean.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/01.html#a101609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
