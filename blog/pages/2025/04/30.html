<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215530"></a>We could follow the clues in the TrumpLand with more gusto. They know their numbers are bad and likely to get worse, they did the things that made it the numbers bad. And at the same time they don't seem to care? If this were a mystery show, like Dallas or Succession or Severance, Lost perhaps, what would you think?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30.html#a215530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175531"></a>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/code/testing/baselineplayground/index.html">prototype</a> of what a story page might look like on our baseline site for WordLand. I did this off on the side as input for the WordPress theme. I find it easier to work on style in a standalone page without much tech that can get in the way of fast iteration. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30.html#a175531" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132130"></a>We're working on the "baseline" theme for WordLand, the default -- the one that shows the user's writing in a WordPress context. I did a survey of news sites and blogs to see how they show their titles:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132130" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132211"></a><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-says-ny-budget-will-create-50m-rental-aid-program-championed-by-tenant-groups">Gothamist</a> puts the name in the upper left corner, leaving room for some buttons and a menu in the right corner.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132211" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132242"></a><a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/04/30/three-coequal-timelines-of-government/">Empty Wheel</a> does the same thing. (I sense a pattern here.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132242" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132251"></a><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-lawmakers-should-reject-fake-chaplains-in-schools-bill/">Missouri Independent</a> centers the title in much bigger type than the previous examples, the buttons are arrayed above it (more buttons).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132251" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132259"></a><a href="https://evgrieve.com/2025/04/east-village-mainstay-cafe-mogador.html">EV Grieve</a> puts the name in the upper left corner without much fanfare. Proves that it doesn't have to be eye-catching, it's the attitude and the content I love. One of my longtime favorites. It's an East Village neighborhood blog, running in Blogger for ages.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132259" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132308"></a><a href="https://seths.blog/2025/04/uncomfortable-ideas/">Seth's Blog</a> is a WordPress site, managed by Automattic. The left sidebar includes the title of the blog, and has a list of things he wants you to read, and how to get on his mail list, etc. So effectively the title is in the upper left corner, and the equiv of the buttons are arrayed vertically in a column. The functionality of his blog is probably closest to what I have in mind for WordLand, but into spartan beginnings. It's easy to add stuff, impossible to take away.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132308" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132318"></a><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/#atom-everything">Simon Willison's Weblog</a>, another great example of the kind of writing I want people to do with WordLand. He puts the title in the upper left corner, with a single button flush right. He deals with the recent articles thing by putting a list of three posts, linkblog style, at the bottom. I like this placement, btw. Positioned as an afterthought. If you're lingering here, you might like this? I pretty much always ignore this kind of stuff.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132318" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132328"></a><a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/04/29/model-train-at-the-casey.html">Manton Reece</a> does the same thing everyone else is doing. Title at the top left, an array of buttons flush-right at the same level. What's uncommon about his style is that the name of his blog is tiny, 13px. But it also is very visible.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132328" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132336"></a><a href="https://kottke.org/25/04/0046739-trump-is-a-hallucinating-">Kottke</a> does not include the title of his blog on a story page. This is remarkable. But he does have the author name very prominently placed, it's the very topmost text on the page, impossible to miss. So amazingly the title is visible, even though it isn't there.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/30/132040.html#a132336" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
