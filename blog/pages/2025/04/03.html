	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215250"></a>They're still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing">sanewashing</a> Trump.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#a215250" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Example. Just listened to Brian Lehrer, a news interview and call-in show on WNYC, which I revere, for many reasons. Lehrer is smart, and doesn't dumb things down for his audience. He usually asks the question I'm dying to hear the answer to, which most reporters don't think of or won't ask.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215307"></a>On the March 27 they had a <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/bl-daily-politics-podcast/articles/columbia-university-faces-the-prisoners-dilemma">discussion</a> about Trump's assault on Columbia University, which has now been extended to Harvard and Princeton. In all of them, the main issue is antisemitism at these universities.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#a215307" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Never in the discussion did they raise this question --<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Do we believe that Trump cares about antisemitism?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>And if he did, there are much bigger antisemites who are much more powerful and much closer to Trump (who is an obvious antisemite himself).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I'll mention just one -- Elon Musk, who actually did the Nazi salute, twice, from the podium with the Presidential Seal on it, at the freaking inauguration.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Musk has also backed the German Nazi party (they have a different name but to use that name would be NaziWashing, which I won't do).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>The Occam's truth is that he's tying antisemitism to things because it's fun for him, and because later -- they will blame Jews for everything that's wrong in the US, as they always do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215341"></a>The whole thing of Trump being a champion for Jewish people made me really uneasy, until I read a <a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/antisemitism-and-antisemitism">piece</a> in Timothy Snyder's newsletter, which I recommend to everyone. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#a215341" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Anyway, I trust Brian Lehrer, I don't think he'd shirk a tough question, I just think as a journalist he still isn't thinking realistically about the world as it is now, instead behaving as he did before it got so rotten.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/03/215240.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
