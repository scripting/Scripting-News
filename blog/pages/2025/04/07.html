RSS is the easiest and fastest way to connect systems. When I see people endorse RSS over social sites I think we took a wrong turn somewhere because all these systems should be connected on the open web and RSS is the perfect way to do that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/07.html#a012928" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a013033"></a>Rachel Maddow's show these days often begins with a hard-to-watch over-the-top endorsement of Bluesky. She shouldn't be doing that. It's a private company and someday she may criticize them as strongly as she did Facebook. I'd love to hear her explain exactly what's the difference between Bluesky and Facebook. A lot less than you might think. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/07.html#a013033" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"Republicans in Congress can put a stop to this at any time." By this, she means the crashing US economy. And even if you believe they'll "never do it" -- it's still the right thing to repeat this over and over -- people should know they could. This should be repeated until enough people get it, this is being done <i>on purpose</i> by the Repubs. This isn't about winning elections, it's about understanding who's doing this to you and how deliberate it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/07.html#a143224" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's better to first <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/07/fileformatScreen.png">use</a> the product or <a href="https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml#1633536117000">read</a> the docs or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+the+native+file+format+for+Drummer%3F&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=What+is+the+native+file+format+for+Drummer%3F&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512i546j0i546i649j69i64.10884j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">search</a> on web or use an <a href="https://claude.ai/share/08b9de36-bc41-454b-a21d-e2edcc75d094">AI chatbot</a> before getting humans involved. Anyway, the answer is yes, OPML is the native file format of <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. It's the reason we chose <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> as the format for RSS reading lists, so we could edit them in a distant <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217">ancestor</a> of Drummer's whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to change file formats gratuitously -- it's how you can use different tools to edit your own data. That's a big part of the plan with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, because the internal file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it's going to be a perfect basis for interop. Learning from past experience and doing it better each time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/07.html#a133100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
