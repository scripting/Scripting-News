<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151444"></a>I've been working on an all-new feature for <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Expect <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/69">something</a> in the next few days, Murphy-willing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/12.html#a151444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2020/05/02/lbj.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144356"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2020/05/02/lbj.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">If we had a better communication system we would not be so vulnerable. We might even be able to defend ourselves. So it's doubly ridiculous that journalism is leading us to Bluesky, when it is just more of the same with a better story. They're asking us to go deeper into the myth that the most toxic tech ever invented is actually good for us. The thing that feels good is the belief that it <i>is</i> good. In that we are just as deluded as the people who think Trump is a genius who understands business and thus will do a great job of running the world economy, a power no previous president had dared to exercise, not even sure they knew they had such power. The educational institutions that are being attacked by Trump now, should have played a role in creating effective communication systems, as should journalism. I got up on stage at a NYT event a few years back and begged them to compete with Twitter. One or two people in the audience of a few hundred were inspired by the idea, but the follow-up was nil. People are comfortable with the belief that the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22baby%20squirrels%22">baby squirrels</a> have our interests at heart. Look at the <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/on-the-media/the-tariff-week-from-hell-JzoHbcF6pdj/">latest</a> On the Media podcast. They're all selling us out, again, and again, and again. It's a loop they'll never get out of. I have friends scattered around the world in places of power. When are we going to work together to create the communication system we need. We're never going to get there by waiting for tech and journalism to get together on this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/12.html#a144356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't think they, or anyone else, realizes how much more this move gives us a chance of building a protected network of communication. Their vision could be achieved much more quickly by giving up their <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22boil%20the%20ocean%22">boil the ocean</a> approach and start taking some simple, very doable steps that would empower outside developers to build a rich ecosystem around their product. The only downside would be that now they really <i>would</i> be replaceable. Anyway, they're partly there. Right now they support outbound RSS, and are improving it. That's the strategically easy half to do. The one that would really open them up is inbound RSS, the protocol that all the other twitter-like systems refuse to support. Want to blow the doors off now instead of some vague time in the future? Support outbound <i>and</i> inbound RSS. Let the trains come into the station and leave the station on a well established protocol. It could be done in a few weeks, really. Maybe the very intelligent and curious people who read this blog would like to take the time to understand what this means and the doors it would open? It's a way to change the subject from "good idea but hopeless" to "hey we can have freedom now."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/12.html#a145222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145818"></a>To really nail it down, supporting inbound and outbound RSS would justify them saying they are part of the "social web." Today's Bluesky has no business claiming to be part of the web, the system they're hyping is fully <a href="https://this.how/bluesky/">centralized</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/12.html#a145818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170043"></a>I went to a special high school in NYC, it was a public school you had to take a test to get into. One day our social studies teacher got some gumption, maybe he had a few drinks, or smoked some weed, but he had courage most teachers never had. He told us who we were. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/12/170024.html#a170043" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170407"></a>Most of us were going to MIT or some other university that sent workers into the establishment to become cogs in the big wheel that kept the world running. He was right. Although my own path wasnâ€™t that direct, I did get there. I rose to the top in Silicon Valley, then a big famous university. Everything Mr Goldman told us that day was true. But what he probably also saw was that he too was a cog, a tool, a piece of the machine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/12/170024.html#a170407" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
