I’m primarily a writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each podcast is in writing the show notes. I have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/69436e223b212315846f5944e0957504">template</a> the writing and audio flow through. Here's an <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">example</a> of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the block-oriented work once, then flow my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady workflow thru the block editor, but their are workflows for designers and writers. WordLand is the flow for writers.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/28.html#a122818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220033"></a>Listened to a segment on today's <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer podcast</a> about how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home. Here's my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it when you're feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an act of self-love and give you some of the body <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">chemistry</a> that you felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian Trail. A similar idea in a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">Bruce Sterling talk</a> in 2009. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/28.html#a220033" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151244"></a>Everything in ChatGPT is <i>so</i> nice. I just asked it about a random plant I got as a gift, and it gave me a beautiful <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/28/deltaDawn.png">one pager</a> with everything I would have had to spend time searching for all right there, beautifully laid out, and all the fine UI touches you might think of already in. It's studying us and learning, and picking out the good stuff, at least so far. The web was like this too in the beginning, mind-exploding inventions every day. We called them <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html">mind bombs</a>. The journalists and social media influencers all just complain, while there is a revolution happening, progress that had slowed to a snail pace, or very often went in reverse, is now coming at breakneck speed. This is as transformative innovation as there has ever been, not that I have much perspective on those that happened before I was invented, but it's as big as the Beatles, the PC, web, mobile. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/28.html#a151244" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
