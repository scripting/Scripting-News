If you have nice standards for what you send through the pipes, you can do more of what you imagine. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_(programming)">orthogonality</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">Factoring</a> is when you notice a repeating pattern, give it a name, and a set of things you can do to it, those would be names of pipes. I have to ask ChatGPT what it thinks about this, but I am also asking my human friends. BTW I expect this seems so natural because our minds probably work that way too, internally, below our conscious awareness. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/02.html#a152605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
