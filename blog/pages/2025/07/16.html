<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150919"></a>I wish ChatGPT would listen when I say "Just answer the question." I've tried, but when it can't figure it out it ignores the request and dumps a lot of bullshit at you. Maybe Trump can address that in his keynote to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/president-donald-j-trump-to-deliver-keynote-address-at-winning-the-ai-race-summit-hosted-by-allin-podcast-and-hill--valley-forum-302505499.html">AI conference</a> in DC.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135021"></a>Someday <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/69056237">Manton and I</a> will make a very nice Markdown editor for Mastodon. Once it's working I'll pitch <a href="https://www.barebones.com/company/history.html">Rich Siegel</a> to do the same for <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>. Along with the WordPress connection, that should nail it once and for all that Mastodon is a blogging platform. Manton is the right guy to do it, he has all the protocols implemented on micro.blog. All I want is a REST version of what the <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog">MetaWeblog API</a> has been <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=MetaWeblog">doing</a> since <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rssVersionHistory.html">2002</a>. We're turning the clock back to move forward. Trying to undo the damage Twitter did to the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/16.html#a135021" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131519"></a>This <a href="https://micro.jasonkratz.me/2025/07/15/well-hot-damn-thanks-to/">comment</a> makes my day. Some features you develop and never use. I poured a month or so into the blogroll software last year, and it turned out to be a total win. All the new stuff floats to the top. I can quickly find out what they posted. It's a portable version of my feed reader. A tighter user interface for FeedLand. And right now I'm working on another user interface for FeedLand. The categories in FeedLand make it possible to do as many projects as you like with the same set of feeds. The Great Art project has a Bluesky account, and is available via RSS, in both an <a href="https://art.feediverse.org/">hourly</a> and <a href="https://artdaily.feediverse.org/">daily</a> form. You need them both. In the new timeline, it's too much to get a work of art every hour, but to have one waiting for you in the morning is a perfect way to start the day. And I was reminded that my friend Paolo had just written a post. RSS is the thing that ties everything together. And a bit of OPML too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/16.html#a131519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
