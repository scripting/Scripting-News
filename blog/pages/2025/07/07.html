	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194427"></a>anyway it's feeling like a lost cause. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a194427" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a000427"></a>to be really blunt, i don't think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">AP</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">ATP</a> are the answer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a000427" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>and i also don't care so much about this style of conversation. and i loathe the character limits and the lack of style and links, and no titles, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>it can't only be for wordpress. i love the potential of wordpress, i think even more than matt does, but it isn't enough.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194447"></a>if it's going to be open and of the web it has to be simple and easy, and neither of them are.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a194447" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

I have that ability these days, but people who use the AP and ATP systems are in tight little boxes with no easy way to try something out quickly. (i know because i've been hooking things up to them for a couple of years now, and so far it's just an added slog, everything is far more complex than it should be)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a202823" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194820"></a>maybe we'll get there through their api's, but i think at this point we know that won't happen.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a194820" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195132"></a>ps: the web is a <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519490474000">miracle</a>. but maybe it's too fucked up now to have the miracle be something we can all experience.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a195132" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200309"></a>pps: when i write on other systems i often leave out upper case, saving a little energy as i type. i find it more relaxing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html#a200309" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193447"></a><i>I wrote this early this morning as a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/07/linkblogging-back-to-normal-after-corner-turn/">test post</a> for my WordLand site. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#a193447" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193519"></a>Happy to report that my linkblog routine is back to normal.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#a193519" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I really shook things up there, and it probably wasn't a great time investment.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193715"></a>I had been using a custom front-end to FeedLand, which has a built in blogging tool, that publishes to the database that FeedLand manages, and of course also publishes an RSS feed. It was debugged and works. But now I have a new editor, and I want to use it for this, because my reader knows how to view all kinds of stuff, and one of the things I wanted it to work well with are linkblog posts. So, do a quick addition of linkblog stuff to WordLand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#a193715" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193629"></a>Only thing is there is no such thing as a "quick addition" in a world built on CSS and HTML objects. Everything is a slog. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#a193629" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193645"></a>Anyway the slog is over! Whew. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#a193645" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193646"></a>Now back to my other slog -- timelines. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#a193646" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>It's also starting to feel usable. People imagine that you just design something and write the code and voila it's usable (if they even think about it that much). But only until you have the pieces put together can you see the things you forgot to consider, and now you have to decide whether to rip up the thing you built or try to iterate to where you need to go. A lot of times it would be easier to start over, but programmers always want to do that. I'm no exception. Once it's working somewhat the code becomes locked into how the pieces fit together. If somehow they need to fit together differently, given it's CSS and HTML you'd better scrap it and do it again or you'll go out of your mind adding the next layer of features. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Honestly we were much better off before we tried to shoehorn an object model into a document format! Apps and documents are really different things you know.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Anyway now I have my first test post of the day.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
