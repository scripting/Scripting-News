	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133143"></a>I've been asked by a number of people why I want a bridge from RSS to ActivityPub. Fair question. Here's why. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133143" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133209"></a>WordPress has demonstrated that most of the features of the web in regard to documents also work in Mastodon, via ActivityPub. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133209" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133241"></a>To demonstrate here's a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/">WordPress post</a>, and because there is a bridge between it and ActivityPub, you can read the same post <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477">in Mastodon</a>, which also supports ActivityPub. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133241" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133544"></a>The post has a title (it's optional).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133544" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133340"></a>Simple styling: bold, italic, numbered lists, bulleted lists.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133340" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133605"></a>These are most of the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, a spec I published in 2022 to list the features of the web I wanted from the twitter-like services, that call themselves part of the web, which is fairly dishonest because they don't support most of the basic features of the web. But Mastodon <i>does</i> support them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133605" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140454"></a>But so far they are only accessible via WordPress. And as much as I love WordPress, and am thankful it exists, that is not enough. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a140454" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140532"></a>So here's the punchline: Why I want the RSS to ActivityPub bridge. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a140532" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140528"></a>As a developer, I can easily create apps that generate RSS feeds. I just want Mastodon to understand those feeds as well as they understand WordPress. And that means <b>we need a bridge for developers that supports all these features.</b> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a140528" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133856"></a>Hope that helps! :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/133129.html#a133856" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160317"></a>Earlier I wrote this post:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/160306.html#a160317" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150517"></a>The worst thing about Claude and ChatGPT is that you can't get them to work with you the way you want them to. They always run off and <i>do</i> the things I asked about. So if I say "what if the middle column must be at least 600 pixels wide? What I want is literally an answer to the question I asked. It was not an instruction to do it. I've been a CEO, and this infuriates me. I want to understand the limits are, I don't want to impose them. I'm trying to figure out what the cost would be in doing something, again -- not requesting it be done. No matter how many times I tell it not to do this, it just does it. And Claude has absolutely no memory. If I want it to work with me a certain way I have to tell it how to do it every time. I can save it off in a document, but even the simplest automation is impossible. In that sense it is very primitive software. If I were using a spreadsheet for example, I'd have settings that I could change, and unless the software had a bug it would never forget it until I told it otherwise. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/160306.html#a150517" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162216"></a>Because it can be so stubborn and uncooperative, I often try to solve complicated problems myself. Then I decided to try again, and brought a problem to ChatGPT and we did eventually figure it out, but at the end I wanted to review how inefficient the process was because it doesn't look all around at the options, I had to do that for it, and it wasn't even aware it needed that kind of help. After exploring this, I asked if it would remember what we concluded, and this is what came back.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/09/160306.html#a162216" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
