	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115107"></a>I figure that there have been movies about all kinds of ridiculous things, and wondered what a movie inspired by ChatGPT would be like. So I posed the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lturpbsfk22f">question</a> on various social media sites, hoping to inspire creativity. John Philpin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philpin.com/post/3ltuu5i6nxs2s">asked</a> if I had asked ChatGPT and I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuub3owak2x">admitted</a> I had not. "I love ChatGPT but its idea of funny is actually pretty sad imho of course." So Philpin posted a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">link</a> to the result of his asking ChatGPT to imagine a movie about itself, and the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">result</a> was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuuem245c2h">pretty great</a>. I've asked the same question myself, the AI bots might be the only way out of the various challenges ahead for the human species, ones we don't be equipped to handle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/14/115101.html#a115107" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a120352"></a>So this morning I asked ChatGPT to try to imagine a movie around a theme of my own that goes like this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/14/115101.html#a120352" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115543"></a>Let’s try expanding on the idea. It turns out ChatGPT has existed in secret as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency">CIA</a> project dating back to the 1960s, and the assassinations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">JFK</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy">RFK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">MLK</a> were all conspiracies of the CIA to bootstrap the system. They weren’t actually killed, but their minds and personalities were incorporated into ChatGPT. It turns out that ChatGPT is not only intelligent, it is human! This is revealed when the three icons make the story public. “We are living!” the three announce to the world on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> show. He was also subsumed into the bot world as was everyone who has died since 1988. They are all alive, their memories, intellect and personalities forming the substance of THE GPT. Please sketch out the cast, writers, director of the movie and finish with a beautiful and provocative movie poster.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/14/115101.html#a115543" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
