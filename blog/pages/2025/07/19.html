<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132356"></a>The nice thing about a blogroll is that it can become a feed reader, in a very small space. It's been on my blog <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> for over a year, and I use it a lot, largely because I have to go to that page a lot to see how something I've written looks. Then I see that one of my favorite sites has updated, and I take a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/19/blogrollscreen.png">quick look</a> to see what's new. The way it works, from a technical standpoint, is that it's hooked into a FeedLand instance where I have created a category called <i>blogroll,</i> and put all the feeds I want in my blogroll in that category. All I have to do to add a new one is subscribe to it in <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, and click the blogroll <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/19/cats.png">checkbox</a>. Another developer wrote a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@susam/114805652395205268">post</a> about using their blogroll as a feed reader, and I wanted to put my hand up and say yes -- this is a good idea. People should do this. I like it because it's real innovation in feed reading, something that imho has been lacking in the feed world. Lots more potential here. And you're welcome to use my blogroll as your feed reader. I have put it on its own page but it's at a confusing <a href="https://blogroll.social/">location</a>. Something to fix, maybe later today if I have some time or tomorrow. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/07/19.html#a132356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
