It's over -- remember the lessons, let's look forward, tonight's vote is already history. Let the Dems in the Senate take care of themselves. It's we, the people, who created this country, and we the people are the only ones who can make it work again.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14.html#a015848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132724"></a>I heard an idea that really resonated in a Brian Lehrer <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/podcasts/0c3b41f0-2c8b-012e-09b1-00163e1b201c/15570ad4-8994-4fe9-83fc-1966fe0e6795">interview</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Giridharadas">Anand Giridharadas</a>, who says among many other things, that we should aim our ire at the <i>leaders</i> of the MAGA movement, and stop bringing our angst to the people who voted for them. Every time I see a condescending TikTok story about them, I think about how that takes us further from getting where we must go. We have to reconcile, we share a country, and our interests are totally aligned. We need each other, that will become completely obvious, and the sooner it does the better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14.html#a132724" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154615"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/57">Question for WordLand users</a>. When you published your first post, were you surprised that the window didn't clear? Did you understand that you can make changes and update the public post? I was just talking with a friend who didn't expect it to behave the way it did.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14.html#a154615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150221"></a>I asked ChatGPT to <a href="https://this.how/earlyWeb/botAuthoredBlogPostFrom1993.html">write a blog post</a> using the technology of 1993. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14.html#a150221" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140902"></a>I was looking over my <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/08.html">blog archive for August 2006</a>, which was when I started using Twitter, and came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTowHh1SFIA">video</a> of Jason Calacanis, at a Wikipedia conference in Cambridge. This is what videos were like back then. I probably took it with a fairly expensive Nikon camera.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14.html#a140902" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135356"></a>Saw an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6h6QGVfrgQ">interview</a> with Mark Cuban where they asked why would Elon Musk do something that would cause Tesla stock to tank. He's got the power to play with the biggest financial thing that has ever existed, and quite possibly that ever will exist. In comparison Tesla is just one car company, with a lot of competition, a market-leading product for sure, but the competition is catching up. They're constantly lowering prices to keep the volume up, so eventually the stock will have to come down anyway. He certainly knows stuff about the company that no one else can see, maybe their new product pipeline is empty? He also has had to deal with short-sellers who have the incentive to drive the price down, and he can't bet alongside them (how would that look, a CEO betting against his own company). No matter what, there is nothing bigger than the USA, and he's got it, and plans to keep it. But he's human, and thus has frailties, and he loses as often as he wins and knows it. Unfortunately for us we're all in his boat now, unless somehow we can wrench it back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14.html#a135356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123014"></a>I keep hearing pundits and incumbent Democrats missing the point, that the people are the ones whose opinion matters about the Republicans dismantling our democracy in the United States. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14/122115.html#a123014" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123102"></a>I want to celebrate those leaders who totally get that the power is with the people, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. They are an inspiration! I live in New York and while AOC doesn't represent me in Congress (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)">Pat Ryan</a> is my rep), in a political and spiritual way she most definitely represents me. She should be the next president, as far as I'm concerned. She has all the leadership abilities we could ever want. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14/122115.html#a123102" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123332"></a>My contribution for today is the slogan that's the title of this piece. It's derived from James Carville's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid">slogan</a> when Bill Clinton was running for president in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election">1992</a>, updated for 2025. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/14/122115.html#a123332" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131019"></a>"It's the people, dummy!" was always the right slogan.
