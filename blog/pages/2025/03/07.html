<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211034"></a>The United States is Russia's 51st state, sad to say. Let's get it back for the people of the United States. We don't like Putin. Sorry.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/07.html#a211034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161635"></a>Before our media was gradually taken over by Russia, they did it to Ukraine, but they managed to dig their way out, had a democratic election, resulting in their current government. So it's not impossible to dig your way out. But you have to stop insisting that <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/07/letHitlerSpeak.png">Hitler be allowed</a> to speak.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/07.html#a161635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160716"></a>The Fediverse is impossible to use even for people who understand what it's trying to do, and most people have no idea. The answer: <b>Stop trying to reinvent Twitter</b>. It wasn't a great idea! And figure out what really works in a decentralized system. It requires some serious brain work.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/07.html#a160716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was really out of shape for that. So I started riding every third day or so. And then without any warning I just passed my 600th ride. Not too bad! :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/07.html#a173201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
