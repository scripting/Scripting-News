<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130938"></a>I like <a href="https://jeffcnichols.net/2025/03/20/the-writers-web-aka-blogging/">Jeff Nichols' piece</a>, but I don't agree that <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the writer's web</a> is blogging. I think it's bigger. Blogging is <i>part</i> of the writer's web. Today's writing network is much more powerful, the software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn't exist last time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better because it's of the web, with <i>no limits. </i>We've got the beginning of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing and reading environments, and we don't need federation because the web takes care of that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/20.html#a130938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So Twitter made subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky, etc mostly can't get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking about it and while they do, we're losing everything that's important to us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can't all be masters of our own silo'd domain. We need a web for words that's simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn't lose the essential features writers need. I don't know what we need to win, but I do know what we need to get started. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/20.html#a133418" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
