<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133946"></a>BTW it's worth <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that's like stereo to mono. We're not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo'd boxes in order to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan, if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don't know. But it's a bizarre situation that I've decided to try to fix. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/10.html#a133946" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131717"></a>A new kind of WordPress post for me. A <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2025/03/10/theseBoomersMeanBusiness.png">big picture</a> with a punchy caption and a teasing title. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/10.html#a131717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130805"></a>The word is starting to spread about <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me think it's not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful. His respect means a lot to me. The positioning -- it makes WordPress as easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it. That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and it's right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or manifesto, whichever you prefer). I'm glad people are seeing this as an enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of them. I want people to feel that it's an essential part of WordPress, for writers. The writer's web. Remember that, you'll be hearing a lot about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There's also an API that comes with WordLand, I'll be talking more about that later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in the browser. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/10.html#a130805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
