	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162805"></a>At some point soon we’re going to have to stop business as usual. Remember when we realized Covid was deadly and we’d have to radically change our lives to survive? Most of us did that. We’re going to do that soon re the overthrow of our government and looting of the economy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/162800.html#a162805" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162817"></a>It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude everything is normal. It’s not. We’re going to have to start shutting down all the services we can to make the point to our fellow citizens that we, the United States, are not coming back from this without major change.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/162800.html#a162817" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162555"></a>First, that's just a theory, but I need to get your attention. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a162555" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160450"></a>Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can do anything, install or uninstall anything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a160450" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160458"></a>Mostly journalism has been reporting "He has our social security numbers." Sigh.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160512"></a>With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete debt. Trump <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a> to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows those guys. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a160512" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161141"></a>You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don't believe me.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a161141" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160545"></a>More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It's clever because it doesn't require soldiers, not one shot will be fired. My guess is that they already have this power. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a160545" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160603"></a>BTW, here's SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table named inventory. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a160603" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160628"></a>Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the greatest depression ever.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a160628" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160628"></a>You don't have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a160628" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161813"></a>Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world economy. It's where people store their money.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/10/160321.html#a161813" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
