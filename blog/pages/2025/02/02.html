<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a015115"></a>A bit of advice for Dems in Congress. Go home and have town halls, and listen. And stop listening to the consultants and each other. Find out what the people want, and bring that back to DC. And let the press attend the town halls so they can report. Make our own <a href="https://tea25.party/">Tea Party</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/02.html#a015115" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We are having a fresh awakening in this country and in the end we may come to thank Musk and Trump for facilitating this. And I'm so glad that online media is making this possible too, in addition to all the nasty shit we're also responsible for. :-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/02.html#a190146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/02.html#a195852" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
