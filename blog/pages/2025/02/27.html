But don't get confused that WordLand is somehow a twitter-like silo. There are already too many of those. I want something much simpler and I believe more useful and less spammy and abusive -- <i>a social network built around RSS.</i> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/27.html#a135116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My favorite scene in the last episode <a href="https://screenrant.com/severance-season-2-episode-6-why-helena-followed-mark-to-restaurant/">took place</a> at a Chinese restaurant. Anyway, I was just listening to the latest episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s2e6-attila-with-christopher-walken-and-sarah-bock/id1788381175?i=1000694662565">Severance podcast</a>, about this episode, which you should definitely listen to if you like me love the show. They have an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken">Christopher Walken</a> who plays <a href="https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Burt_Goodman">Burt</a>. Amazing stuff. But even more amazing is that I learned in the podcast that the restaurant mentioned earlier is actually a famous <a href="https://www.engsrestaurant.com/">Kingston restaurant</a> that just <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/food/article/engs-chinese-restaurant-kingston-opens-dining-room-20058303.php">re-opened</a> after a long hiatus, so I've not yet had a chance to eat there, but I want to, <a href="https://www.engsrestaurant.com/">Eng's</a>. This, after learning that <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2025/1/27/24350496/severance-pips-phoenicia-diner-catskills">the diner</a> that's in two scenes, one in each season, is the <a href="https://www.phoeniciadiner.com/">Phoenicia Diner</a>, one of my favorite local eating places. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/27.html#a192725" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174935"></a>I lived in a big house with 10 roommates. And as weird as it must seem from the point of view of 2025, I was the only one who used a computer. I would tell them all the time that we'd all use computers someday. They rolled their eyes and smiled. "There goes Dave again." The reason I was so sure was email and writing tools. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/27/173205.html#a174935" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
