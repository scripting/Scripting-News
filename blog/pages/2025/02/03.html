Women are better in general at seeing the big picture and managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of the problem and if they're good, do something brilliant, but misses out on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely discipline myself to get anything done, because that's how I'm built. Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing until its done, then the next and the next and so on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/03.html#a220843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/03.html#a184538" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
