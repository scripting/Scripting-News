<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150138"></a>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-Xbn92mXE">two-minute demo</a> of my new writing tool for Bluesky. This is quite a bit simpler than the last version, you log on directly to Bluesky, doesn't go through my server at all. This removes a whole layer of complexity for the user, and means a lot of people can use it without it having to scale up. Also made it simpler, more of a writing tool, closer to where I'd like this stuff to be when we have across-the-board textcasting support. Really focused on the flow for writers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/13.html#a150138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144406"></a>Re-did the social media links at the bottom of each story page. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/13/socialMediaLinks.png">Screen shot</a>. Used to be just RSS and Linkedin. I got rid of Linkedin because I never use it. Added Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads. Debated whether to remove Twitter, but it is still a way to follow my posts, the ones that go out through the linkblog. A lot of people still use Twitter. Had to include the latest version of Font-Awesome, but since my story pages don't otherwise use FA, I figured nothing could break. Haha. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/13.html#a144406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
