Here's an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3limh2mzjdh2p">example</a>. And here's the <a href="https://skywrt.com/scripting.com/006">version</a> of the thread without being broken up into 300-character chunks (you can get it by clicking in the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/20/clickHereToReadFullThread.png">metadata box</a> below the text of the post). I don't like it. The software is as good as it can be, given the extreme limits of the twitter-like environment. I went all the way with this, but I'm not sure I'm going to release it. But I'm going to keep using it, and maybe I'll think of something that makes it fun or worthwhile, or maybe I'll just chalk it up to another learning experience. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/20.html#a135923" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134024"></a>Favorite part of the <a href="https://www.nbc.com/snl50-the-anniversary-special">SNL50</a> show. Eddie Murphy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qYM6bKl57A&t=34s">impersonating</a> Tracy Morgan, while standing next to him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qYM6bKl57A">Black Jeopardy</a>. It's really hard to see the resemblance between today's Eddie and young Eddie, but there it was, the comic brilliance. Then they ask the real Tracy if they are related and he said he doesn't see it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/20.html#a134024" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And Trump & Musk. A quadruple threat. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/20.html#a133758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134916"></a>Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky <i>will</i> disappoint you. Don't blame them when it happens, because they can't be as good as people think they are. They're a startup in a tough market. Sooner or later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards. There isn't one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise up, give them a little the Rachel we love. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/20.html#a134916" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
