I was interviewed by the very capable Nathan Wrigley of WP Tavern. I thought it was a great conversation, we talked about the remarkable position WordPress is in to serve as the OS for a rebooted web. I love the introduction they wrote, I also figured out how to make content management work in the browser, which was the foundation for blogging and eventually WordPress, though it seems that legacy is a bit lost in all the other stuff I've had my fingers in over the years. I hope you listen to this podcast, and if you have <a href="https://wptavern.com/podcast/186-dave-winer-on-decentralisation-wordpress-and-open-publishing">questions or comments</a>, here's a good place to post them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/25.html#a130421" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171327"></a>This came up in a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@darius@friend.camp/115266052576766302">thread</a> on Mastodon about "social network" vs "social media." I also think <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22">social web</a> should be used sparingly.  Because imho there is such a thing as the social web but we haven't developed very much of it, i think because we were intimidated by the silos. I'm not intimidated any more, I'm fed up and going ahead without them.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/25.html#a171327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
