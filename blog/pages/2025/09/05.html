<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145720"></a>I upgraded <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a> to a new version of the system software, still being tested. In the process I started a fresh items table. This means for the next day or so your timeline may have a lot of items for a few feeds, as it catches up with every feed it keeps track of. The server was down for a couple of hours while we did the upgrade. Still diggin! ;-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/05.html#a145720" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
