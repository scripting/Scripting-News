<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/07/livesOfOthersPoster.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145342"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/07/livesOfOthersPoster.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Two videos every US resident should watch to prepare for what might be coming. 1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others">The Lives of Others</a>. A drama set in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">eastern part</a> of post-war Germany before the wall came down. People lived their lives, but their relationship with the government and the military would seem very strange to an American of 2025, But more of this is definitely what's on the way, and the technology for watching what you do is much better now, and our neighbors aren't any different, which is what the Germans depended on. 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)">The Handmaid's Tale</a>. Same kind of police state as in Lives of Others with a Christian twist. Everyone is a member of a caste. Most women are infertile since some unspecified disaster, and the ones who can reproduce exist only to reproduce. There are women who clean the house, and do a few other things. There are certainly other books, movies and series worth tuning into, but these are the ones I recommend now. Handmaid's Tale is also a book, which I have read, but the show on Hulu goes into more detail.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/07.html#a145342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171537"></a><a href="https://socketdemo.feedland.org/">New demo app</a>. FeedLand communicates back to the client app via websockets. This is absolutely the easiest way to get flow from feeds to apps running on servers or in a browser, or other desktop app. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">Websockets</a> is a mature <a href="https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/">standard</a>, and incredibly useful. I'm now working on a toolkit for it, along with all the other projects going on in parallel, so other developers can hook into <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> to get the flow of new items. The <a href="https://socketdemo.feedland.org/">demo</a> shows you the JSON version of every news item as it appears on the wire. There's no limit to the kinds of apps you can build for this. My <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Chuck%20Shotton%22">friend</a> Chuck Shotton has a market-predicting LLM app that gets its news this way. Nothing to install on a server. FeedLand does all the work. I expect to have a toolkit out sometime in the few weeks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/07.html#a171537" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172126"></a>Another application for websockets. You could actually put a web server on your desktop without exposing your home network to the world. I can't wait till I have time to play around with this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/07.html#a172126" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
