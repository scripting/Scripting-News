<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140855"></a><a href="https://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a>, an OG blogger of great renown, now has a FeedLand <a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll">blogroll</a> on her WordPress blog. It is I believe going to make her blog feel less <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blogs-don-t-need-to-be-so-lonely">lonely</a>. If anyone else wants to get one going, I have more confidence that it's pretty do-able. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/10/stephanieBlogroll.png">Screen shot</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/10.html#a140855" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140245"></a>Heh. Yesterday I started writing a post about something Brent wrote on his blog, and then I must've gotten distracted and didn't finish it. I will now proceed to explain. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/10.html#a140245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140321"></a>Brent <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html">said</a> he cares about desktop software but not about phone and tablet versions of same. I found that liberating. It's always been a pain in the ass to do something beautiful on the desktop only to have to destroy its utility by squeezing it into a space with no keyboard or pointing device that's more accurate than my finger (I have huge fingers, and a normal size phone). I found it liberating, but -- I'm working on the design of an app that should work well on either a phone or a laptop, and I've had that in mind the whole life of the product. But now I realize in a new way that it's a choice. It always was, but it didn't <i>feel</i> that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/10.html#a140321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
