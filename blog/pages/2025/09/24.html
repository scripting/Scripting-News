It has a REST api that you can build on. Everything WordPress does. It's the API the <a href="https://dashboard.wordpress.com/wp-admin/index.php?page=my-blogs">browser client</a> is built on. I didn't know it was there until I added WordPress login to FeedLand a couple of years ago. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. What can I do with it? It snuck up on me that it's an API for the web, and it's also the easiest API for ActivityPub. The programming model for the fediverse might be a lot simpler than you think. WordLand is as exciting as any web product I did before, because now, after being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle">asleep</a> for 19 years, the web can now wake up. It really feels that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/24.html#a134803" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143250"></a>Yesterday's <a href="https://openchannels.fm/exploring-wordpress-textcasting-and-open-web-standards/">podcast</a> was with Matthias Pfefferle, who is developing Automattic's ActivityPub functionality. I talk about the totality of the app I'm building and the role WordPress and RSS play in the network. It's an all-web approach to social media. Another big podcast came out today, this one for the WordPress community. I'll write it up tomorrow. I'm on a press tour folks and having a great time. I think I finally found my tribe? And if you're in Canada, come to <a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/">WordCamp in Ottawa</a>, October 15-17. I haven't given a public in person talk since April 2019. I'm realllly looking forward to this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/24.html#a143250" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
