The two are connected by a well-developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> interface, which I will provide code for, as well as docs for what goes over the wire. I think a lot of feed <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aficionado">aficionados</a> will find this really interesting (and also really simple).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/04.html#a141446" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142256"></a>Another thing I should have mentioned, about the title of the <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/09/03/lastChanceForTheOpenWeb.html">podcast</a>, I think this <i>is</i> the last chance for the open web. It may already be too late. Look at what's happening politically in the US now and ask how tolerant the government is going to be of an open web. We always had to deal with the possibility that they would shut down free speech here. It has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act">tried</a>, didn't work in the 90s. But the guardrails that existed then possibly don't exist now. The same things that are forcing CBS for example to become a controlled press, may affect the web too, but you won't read about it in the NYT or hear about it on Maddow because they have low regard for non-professional people writing on the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/04.html#a142256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144857"></a>ChatGPT might not give you the best answer. Yesterday I hit a problem with the MySQL hosting service, and as we worked it out, ChatGPT and me, I ended up contacting the ISP's support asking them to restart the server, something I cannot do through the control panel. They don't do that, and made a couple of suggestions which didn't seem to make sense based on what ChatGPT had told me. So I tried what they suggested and it worked, and went back to ChatGPT and asked what it thought, and it said yes of course that worked, and would you like me to show you how to do it even better. I guess it takes a path and never goes back to see if there isn't a better one. We've been through this before. Anyway, always be circumspect about it's advice, it's not just hallucinations you need to watch for. That said, with help from both ChatGPT and Digital Ocean, I now have a better setup, and it should run without the problem we hit yesterday. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/04.html#a144857" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152713"></a>AI is as good at writing software as it is in creating competent visual art. It's only amazing in terms of how much more a novice can do. It doesn't mean what they create is interesting in more than a gee-wiz way, and the novelty fades pretty quickly I've found.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/04.html#a152713" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
