It's from 1996, I was reporting from a tech conference I was at where there were all angry men on stage threatening everyone else. They may not have known they were doing that, but it was awful. And so different from the web we were just beginning to understand at that time. I'm going to start going through the posts that I remember making a difference at the time. No better way for me to remember what the web is, going back to these memories when it was all fresh and new, before the leaders of tech realized what was going on. Google didn't ship for another two years. It probably wasn't even in development at the time. Yet I think the last section is a good anthem for the web, for those of us who think it's time to cut pop all the bullshit off the stack and get back to our roots.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15.html#a150723" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143619"></a>I had a flash last night during the Emmys. <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/09/14/the-bloggers-of-mastodon/">The Bloggers of Mastodon</a>. I loved the concept right off the bat, so I wrote a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/09/14/the-bloggers-of-mastodon/">blog post</a> using in WordLand that went through WordPress and landed <a href="https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/115205341809959164">on Mastodon</a>. It all works. Where are the other Bloggers of Mastodon? Let's start a club!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15.html#a143619" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140710"></a>This question has come up quite a bit lately. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a140710" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140948"></a>People don't know that there are two places you can use FeedLand, feedland.org and feedland.com.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a140948" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141016"></a>There's a lot of history here, and some uncertainty about the future, so there's not much I can do other than explain the situation.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141016" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141040"></a>First you're welcome to use either of them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141040" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141049"></a>feedland.org is running on a simple small server on Digital Ocean, and feedland.com is on Automattic's VIP network. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141049" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141125"></a>If feedland.org gets overloaded, it gets slow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141125" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141724"></a>if feedland.com gets overloaded, it adds more servers and should stay about the same at all times. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141724" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141235"></a>You should pick one and use it and not have two accounts, but people accidentally create them, because in some places we point to .com and in others we the default is .org. It's because we haven't gotten it together yet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141235" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141340"></a>There are also performance issues on .com -- ones that we still need to address. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141340" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140834"></a>That's about all I can say at this point. At the same time I'm working on a whole other product while all this is happening, and I'm not that young, and really can only work so many hours a day before I have to stop. A fact. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a140834" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141500"></a>And I'm really glad so many new people are trying FeedLand. I use it myself in so many ways. And it will be deeply integrated with WordLand in the next release. I'm not kidding. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15/140703.html#a141500" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
