Who would you want it not sold to? If it were independent how would it make enough money to maintain the software? What should change? What should not?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/12.html#a153722" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)">Six Feet Under</a>, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a> too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda.
