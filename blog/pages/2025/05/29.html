	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151536"></a>this shit is hard. when it's done it looks simple. but these pieces must fit together. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/29/151457.html#a151536" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>that's why it's soooo stupid to throw out all the interop, because it's going to take you forever to recreate it, if you ever can, which you probably can't.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/29/151457.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>this is why we used mp3 in rss to make podcasting. we could have said oh shit i don't understand how mp3 works, so let's create one that does only what podcasting needs. only of course it'll turn out that podcasting needs everything that mp3 already does.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/29/151457.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
