I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a> Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/18.html#a230830" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
