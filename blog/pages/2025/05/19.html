<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144041"></a>I've been working on the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=daytona">search function</a> for this blog, and now we have all the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=davenet">DaveNet</a> pieces between 1994 and 2004 in the database. <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=autoweb">Autoweb</a> was my first static site generator. Here's a search for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22">menu sharing</a> which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/19.html#a144041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222356"></a>How to understand Trump talking about tariffs. Remember how he talked about Covid.

I provide the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database#the-sql-table">schema</a> and example <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database#code-to-import">JavaScript code</a> that, via SQL, updates a database.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220927"></a>I am a programmer, so you might think I'd see it the same way because what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I create "intellectual property" which can be easily copied.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/19/220650.html#a220927" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share what we do and let other people use it. They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/19/220650.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221228"></a>What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/19/220650.html#a221228" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023149"></a>Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say "no one did anything first" (paraphrasing) and that's basically the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html">same idea</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/19/220650.html#a023149" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
