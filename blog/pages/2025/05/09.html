	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202501"></a>I have been writing the colorful saga of my sad depressed programmer friend on Facebook, and it was getting some interest from friends until I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308">moved it into a group</a> and now no one reads it, which makes me sad and depressed too because the story of my programmer friend took an interesting turn after he maxed out on space, got a call from the NBA commisioner asking if he would mind officiating the Knicks two playoff games in Boston this last week. My friend, was of course quite sad and depressed, but he was also exhausted and bored, so he said yes. Here he is before the first of two games, which partially thanks to his officiating were near-blowouts for the Celtics, and thus the Knicks are up 2-0 heading into tomorrow's game in New York.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/202442.html#a202501" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
