<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125701"></a>Someday I'll be able to point ChatGPT at the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">home page</a> for writing about WordLand, and tell it to read every page that's linked to it, and from that put together a well-organized book about WordLand. Maybe sometime next year perhaps??  I used that as a prompt, to see what <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/10/writeABookForWordland.png">ChatGPT</a> would say.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10.html#a125701" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142016"></a>Software isn't a thing, it isn't finished, it's a process as it gets invented by the users. It's a performing art. WordLand today is like a musician performing in a small club, working out the playlist, and hoping to be playing at theaters then arenas, and finally someday, if we're very good, stadiums. But we need help. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/141952.html#a142016" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142031"></a>If you love WordLand, subscribe. Use the software. Learn what it can do, hit its limits, make requests. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/141952.html#a142031" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142040"></a>I remember very well being handed a list of feature requests by Apple's lead evangelist from a new exec they just hired at Apple. I looked at the list, and handed it back and said I'd like to meet him. On the paper was the top ten list of <i>every</i> MORE user at the time. We knew what they wanted because we listened, studied, and learned. I knew his new boss was a real user, and thus I knew we could do stuff together. It worked out exactly that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/141952.html#a142040" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124943"></a>We lived for the first years of my life in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights">Jackson Heights</a>, which is probably, today, the most culturally diverse place in the world. In the 1960s it was a white neighborhood that was adjacent to a black neighborhood, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens">Corona</a>. They paired our elementary schools when I was in third or fourth grade. My little brother went to the school in Corona, and I stayed in the school in Jackson Heights. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/125322.html#a124943" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125424"></a>There's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2025/05/10/eveWinerPeterWinerWalkToSchool.png">famous picture</a>, in our family at least, of my mother walking my brother to school. It was on the front page of the NYT one day. That was a big deal then.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/125322.html#a125424" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125003"></a>When I was in fifth grade we moved to Flushing. It was a sleepy little place (for NYC), nice houses, mostly Irish and Italian families with a few Jews. Now it's a Far East culture, from China and Korea, and still just as nice as it ever was. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/125322.html#a125003" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125318"></a>We have a system in this country, it takes people from everywhere and gives them a platform to create whatever they want. In Flushing it's the best Chinese food in the city, which is saying a lot.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/10/125322.html#a125318" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
