<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152134"></a>So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e">example</a>. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/11.html#a152134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a121042"></a>I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree "I own you." The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. "I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die." I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership. But it sure did put things in perspective!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/11/120442.html#a121042" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
