	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132526"></a>I feel like I should help Harvard, because Harvard helped me, and if you use podcasting or RSS, it helped you too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/133157.html#a132526" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133221"></a>In 2002, I was ready to leave Silicon Valley, and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> needed a safe place to be parked, or I felt the tech industry would keep trying to own it, and make it far more complicated than it needed to be. And I wanted the intellectuals of academia to blog. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/133157.html#a133221" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133258"></a>So I knocked on the door at Harvard, because I heard they had a program that was close to being up my alley -- the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society. My friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a> was a founding member. I figured if they could handle a Grateful Dead lyricist, and general muck-raking rabble-rouser like <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Barlow">Barlow</a>, they might be able to appreciate someone of my creative caliber. They accepted me, gave me run of the place, defended us when we got in trouble and great things came from it. But I always felt like a bit of a thorn in the side of the great elite Harvard University. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/133157.html#a133258" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133342"></a>Yet I really really really appreciate what they did, but I think what I have to offer might not be appreciated. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/133157.html#a133342" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133940"></a>I think they should take advantage of their unique perspective on what's happening in the US, and cover it in a way that no news organization would or could, but the way a great, challenged, <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/in-focus/harvard-and-the-american-revolution/">revolutionary</a> academic institution would. And it might be that the people who would destroy it don't want to take the risk that Harvard might be heard, and it might be a bit premature for them to think they can take control of an organization that in a sense represents the best of the USA since 1636. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/133157.html#a133940" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134227"></a>PS: When Harvard was 140 years old it stood against the King of England in the <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/harvards-year-of-exile/">American Revolution</a>. The Continental Army lived on the Harvard Campus in 1775 and 1776. The precedent for revolution is baked into the soul of Harvard, it seems to me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/133157.html#a134227" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123815"></a>I never really had any opinion about the Indiana Pacers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/123801.html#a123815" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123904"></a>Honestly I was surprised they even made the playoffs this year.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/123801.html#a123904" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123914"></a>And they did catch the Knicks with their pants down, after clearing out the reigning champion Boston Celtics in the second round of the playoffs this year, it took some time before they found their balance again. We learned, again, that we need to have some minutes every game where Brunson takes a long well-deserved rest, so there's room for KAT to lead the team (our other all-star and all-NBA player), and make sure the other Knicks get a chance to shine, and give the Pacers something to guess about. Brunson is great at charging the rim against all odds, but you don't make the Finals if that's the only trick in your quiver. Hopefully we don't have to keep learning that lesson. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/123801.html#a123914" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124120"></a>My advice for Halliburton, take a moment and breathe and realize <i>this series isn't over.</i> The Knicks have a say in it too. And the two teams are remarkably well matched. And despite what the pundits say, there's nothing very special about the Pacers, in fact they have some growing up to do. Halliburton, if they should happen to win another game this year, should learn that either of the first two games in the series could easily have gone the other way. And so should the freaking pundits, when they focus on how great the Pacers were and how pitiful the Knicks are. The Pacers won the first game by three points, and the second one by five. And the Knicks won the third game by six. Could have gone the other way too. And the Knicks are fucking great at overcoming 20-point deficits. The absolute best in the NBA. I have to remember that too, because there was a point in yesterday's game where I gave up. Dave of little faith. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/123801.html#a124120" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123846"></a>They will call this dance The Halliburton Choke. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/155665636105">Reggie Miller</a> made it famous and Halliburton made it ridiculous, and vice versa.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/26/123801.html#a123846" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
