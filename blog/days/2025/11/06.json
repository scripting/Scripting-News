Had time to sit in Washington Square Park, then I rode a Citibike up to where I used to live near Columbus Circle. On the way I shot a video of a woman on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHMExdDXEiU\">West St</a> with a sign that said Honk For Democracy. I thought it was a nice shot, and typically NYers drove right by her, no honking, unfortunately. I also shot a video in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKaWr35gUwM\">Washington Square Park</a>. NYC is photogenic, interesting, and still where I come from, proudly.",

My chat with Matt helped me understand what we're doing. One of the things we talked about is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/11/06/141023.html\">an idea</a> I thought he would understand and love.

Then how many steps does it take to add that to your subscription list on your phone? That's the trick in software design, is it too much work to justify the benefit? If it is, you won't do it. But if we can make it easy, as easy as subscribing to a news feed, you might. Ideally it should be one click followed by a confirmation.",
