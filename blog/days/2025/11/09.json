That's what <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/11/08.html#a152308\">DemoLand</a> is all about. I think I finished it today, have to do another review, maybe two, before making it public. It is the opposite of a product that's meant to dominate. It's more like <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=macwrite\">MacWrite</a>, to fill a niche as an invitation to others to come play. Remember in the web, all parts are replaceable. ",
