I wrote it up on my <a href=\"https://daveverse.org/2025/10/30/markdown-support-coming-in-netnewswire/\">daveverse site</a>, which I edit with \"WordLand\", which means it has a <a href=\"https://wordland.dev/scripting/237777565/rss.xml\">special feed</a> that contains <a href=\"https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000\">source:markdown</a> elements. You can be one of the first people with markdown-support in your feed, and in doing so, help the bootstrap.

There was a serious performance problem, that, with the help of <a href=\"https://ohryan.ca/author/admin/\">Ryan Neudorf</a> who I met in Ottawa, and Scott Hanson, longtime contributor here, was <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDev/issues/8\">fixed</a>. It was a daring move, it meant that <i>all</i> the timeline-generating code in FeedLand had to be rewritten. It was worth it. If you've ever felt that FeedLand was too slow at displaying news, please try again, I think you'll be pleased.",
