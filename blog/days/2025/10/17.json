Yesterday's presentation went really well, lots of smart people really interested, fantastic discussion after. A very nice web culture. I went with three slides to get started, and then talked, demo'd, answered questions, and listened to ideas. Told a few jokes. Got a few laughs. It got the job done, help feed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-of-mouth_marketing\">word of mouth</a> on \"WordLand\". ",
