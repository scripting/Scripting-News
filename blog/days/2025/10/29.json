How much better our lives would be if we focused on the good, generous and creative people among us who have made our lives better? ",

They weren't huge things, but they showed he was thinking about the user. Not surprising that a few years after our competiton between Sidekick and Ready he went on to prove that a mobile phone would make a great camera. He not only thought of it, he made it work. That's the kind of spirit I admire. ",
