We're getting ready to try it on other systems. On the way I hit a problem with the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js\">wpcom package</a> that implements the WordPress API in Node.js. Apparently the new version depends on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/runtime/v/8.0.0-beta.1\">babel/runtime</a>, but it isn't listed as a dependency in their <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/trunk/packages/wpcom.js/package.json\">package.json</a> file. I worked around the problem by adding that dependency in wpidentity's <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/package.json\">package.json</a> file, and that fixed the problem. Had trouble getting this report in their <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues\">issues</a> section. ",

One thing is for sure, we're going to depend on FeedLand more as we go two-way in WordLand. I've been <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22radio%20userland%22\">here</a> before. Have to let my mind mull things over before the movement resumes. ",
