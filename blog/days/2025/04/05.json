Even worse that the dollars in the account will buy even less as the US dollar loses its value as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight-to-quality#:~:text=A%20flight%2Dto%2Dquality%2C,gold%20and%20other%20precious%20metals.\">flight to safety</a> currency. It's not a big surprise as the US behaves like a drunk <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">Dunning-Kruger</a> deluded schoolyard bully. What is amazing, if you think about it, is that we aren't having an emergency impeachment and trial to get him out of there. That could actually restore a bit of confidence of the outside world, showing that the power in the US is more with the people than it has been for a long time. Maybe our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa\">would-be overlords</a> are scared too at what their idea has unleashed. Even if Trump weren't so inept, eventually whoever you choose as the monarch, they're going to behave like this. Inevitable. We could have a revolution right now, fix this, and set the country on the right course. We could do it. I believe we could.",
