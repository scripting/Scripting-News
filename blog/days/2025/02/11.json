I haven't chosen the actual date yet. In the meantime, Please <a href=\"https://this.how/feedland/#1739205763000\">download</a> a copy of your subscription list before the shutdown, it's incredibly easy. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/README.md\">run your own</a> FeedLand. I started a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/245\">thread</a> on the support site if you have questions, remember the comment <a href=\"https://this.how/commentGuidelines/\">guidelines</a>. I've learned a lot from the experience of running FeedLand this way, looking forward to trying some other configurations. :smile:",
