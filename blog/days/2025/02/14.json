I get it. That's what it feels like to be in a Silicon Valley company that has been acquired by another Silicon Valley company, a subject I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html\">wrote about</a> on Wednesday. I wish there was some way for us to communicate with each other about this, because I'm sure my description comes closer to the way Musk sees it, though they are very similar ideas. One of the defects of the social web is that we live in little bubbles and not much information is exchanged over bubble boundaries. So if anyone knows Applebaum, please send her a link to this post. Thanks. ",
