If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz\">Aaron Swartz's</a> statue unveiled in San Francisco <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/\">yesterday</a> to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing \"RSS\" in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html\">suicide</a>. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue. And the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072\">random snarky slogan</a> my test script picked out was really <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png\">appropriate</a> to the <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c\">event</a>. It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made a big contribution. I often think about that. ",
