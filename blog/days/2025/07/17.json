            "text": "I found another thing that's possible in the age of ChatGPT. A few years ago I wondered if a product existed. I wanted a small footprint audio amplifier, with that could control a pair of high-end tower speakers I've had for a long time. I was tired of huge receiver boxes with buttons and dials and inputs for all kinds of audio input. I no longer have a phonograph or a CD or tape player. Just one audio input coming from the TV, that gets all its input from an Apple TV box (or the one made by Google or Amazon or whoever). It should have a volume control and an equalizer. And forget about dials, it should all be controlled from an app on my phone. But most important, it has to be small and happy with wireless connections except for the crucial connections. If such a product existed five years ago I couldn't find it. But last night I was roaming around on my iPad while watching the news, and thought to ask this: \"I have two good speakers, need a modern amplifier that takes HDMI eArc input and powers the speakers. I want something simple and small.\" Well yes, turns out such products do exist. And from the initial list provided by Gemini, I ended up buying the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LPzeb1_nWwaxxhYTZZo8FT_tp33-ktdOKEUqq5l9BZrawoejFM75nt-yMD2GpcZjX6ZdVxNHL62vpMB32qOSrUFCtYcoxq3OPZ1sYATw7S1_x-_uu8C3IiZT2sZ2Ro4_8NkwnVwlpqMbYCzsDjyxUTaHlvEmidBwl-2lI_8plGfuU8hvK1j16S4xzGBGggjkVrJcVT7l-I4hUK48EAsyzENZzN7bNLusz_fctPd5B1s.CLghoXuAUjbtyKhN2wz157HTi844aG-DXNR0T9H78c4&dib_tag=se&hvadid=694387328048&hvdev=c&hvexpln=67&hvlocphy=1023511&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=16195174335375627700--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16195174335375627700&hvtargid=kwd-1967268820035&hydadcr=13743_13389861&keywords=wiim%2Bamp&mcid=281f4dd8014b3c3698b04a849d4c09a4&qid=1752750449&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1\">first one</a> they recommended, though I was tempted by the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Denon-Amplifier-High-Res-Streaming-Bluetooth/dp/B0D6XCGVCZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28FXU4OPJ748W&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PhLSxTVDhAoWi-mcQ6A0FpKL0AuFYUWUMlB_23CmvLz01ZJtb0MbzevGDRe8tb5kl1_c2WZyUxGZGvYtUi9_nIIWSO42cxq5KvBN3EBHypq-vkN99F1ro1P9I3ddfps3OPbbrSjvHN7EOoLX3ydqtTlJkNjCKwzQ9UWwY2eMJOWUrPJBdYPidRPteTE4Bv9jOD8WAs6H9dGlj_Mpsg0eX3vnIKPes-E0PicGn54wq7Y.5HJ7eiZCWeWk8ylgHyJcsl9tpllGD5FU2by0--wJRu0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Denon+Home+Amp&qid=1752750499&sprefix=denon+home+amp%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-1\">second</a>. Then I thought to ask about the speakers, I bought them for $3K when I moved to Berkeley in 2006. I took a picture of the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/17/label.png\">bar code sticker</a> on the back of one of the speakers and gave it to Gemini, and it told me all about it. It was more information than I had when I bought them. It was worth <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LPzeb1_nWwaxxhYTZZo8FT_tp33-ktdOKEUqq5l9BZrawoejFM75nt-yMD2GpcZjX6ZdVxNHL62vpMB32qOSrUFCtYcoxq3OPZ1sYATw7S1_x-_uu8C3IiZT2sZ2Ro4_8NkwnVwlpqMbYCzsDjyxUTaHlvEmidBwl-2lI_8plGfuU8hvK1j16S4xzGBGggjkVrJcVT7l-I4hUK48EAsyzENZzN7bNLusz_fctPd5B1s.CLghoXuAUjbtyKhN2wz157HTi844aG-DXNR0T9H78c4&dib_tag=se&hvadid=694387328048&hvdev=c&hvexpln=67&hvlocphy=1023511&hvnetw=g&hvocijid=16195174335375627700--&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16195174335375627700&hvtargid=kwd-1967268820035&hydadcr=13743_13389861&keywords=wiim%2Bamp&mcid=281f4dd8014b3c3698b04a849d4c09a4&qid=1752750449&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1\">$300</a> to see if the speakers were worth keeping. They've done a fair amount of traveling from California to NYC then to the mountains.
