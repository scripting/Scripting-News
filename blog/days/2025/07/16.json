Along with the WordPress connection, that should nail it once and for all that Mastodon is a blogging platform. Manton is the right guy to do it, he has all the protocols implemented on micro.blog. All I want is a REST version of what the <a href=\"https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog\">MetaWeblog API</a> has been <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=MetaWeblog\">doing</a> since <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rssVersionHistory.html\">2002</a>.

I poured a month or so into the blogroll software last year, and it turned out to be a total win. All the new stuff floats to the top. I can quickly find out what they posted. It's a portable version of my feed reader. A tighter user interface for FeedLand. And right now I'm working on another user interface for FeedLand. The categories in FeedLand make it possible to do as many projects as you like with the same set of feeds. The Great Art project has a Bluesky account, and is available via RSS, in both an <a href=\"https://art.feediverse.org/\">hourly</a> and <a href=\"https://artdaily.feediverse.org/\">daily</a> form. You need them both. In the new timeline, it's too much to get a work of art every hour, but to have one waiting for you in the morning is a perfect way to start the day. And I was reminded that my friend Paolo had just written a post. RSS is the thing that ties everything together. And a bit of OPML too. ",
