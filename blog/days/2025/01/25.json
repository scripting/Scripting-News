An observation -- it's made my <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com\">Bluesky account</a> virtually unusable. Anything else I publish there is swamped by the viral post. I'm also working on a new version of the software that turns Bluesky into a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy\">feed reader</a>. It will be able to manage multiple rivers, where the first version could only do one. The next reader will be all the posts from me on all the various services I post to that have outbound RSS feeds. After that, I have ideas for special feeds for specific publications. I want to help our friends in the blogging and news world, using the best communication tools available. I find now that people are much more open to ideas. This is good. But we should never be complacent. Learn from the competition. They were getting ready for this moment, we weren't. ",
