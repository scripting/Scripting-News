I thought how weird, I didn't go anywhere at all, I stayed exactly <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">where</a> I was, all the time. Virtually every day. If people cared to know what I think they could have found out pretty quickly because I am of course an \"NBB\". I talk about what I think all the time. (And besides, why do you care where you get ideas from, I don't.)",
