Who they are and what they're accused of is unknown, as if there's any substance to the accusation. No indictment, trial, verdict, appeals, etc. El Salvador wants to be the US dumping ground for undesirables. This is where we have, as <a href=\"https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-evil-at-your-door\">Timothy Snyder says</a>, regime change. I thought the elmination of Social Security would have been the moment the light went on for most Americans, but this should be it. Citizens like you and me being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses_in_Chile_under_Augusto_Pinochet\">disappeared</a>. It's a pretty quick way to get most of the people to behave according to the rules of the government, or off you go. ",
