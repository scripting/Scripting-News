Ideas that have stood the test of time, that mean something now, but eventually will be set aside and no one will know what a TLTB was.)",

I jot stuff down during the day, mostly in the morning, and later add links and finish stuff up. The scripting.com feed is updated in realtime. So you may get many versions of an item over the day, which might be a problem with feed readers that don't watch for changes. I noticed that my changes to a recent podcast <a href=\"https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html\">shownotes page</a> don't flow back out to my podcast client app on Android. \"FeedLand\" btw, records changes, and they flow through to the timeline. Coupled with \"rssCloud\", which is supported in every WordPress site, makes the whole thing realtime. People assume that feeds have to perform like a feed reader. But if you have a component running on the open internet, hooked up via websockets to the client, you get the flow they get in twitter-like systems. And we didn't have to invent anything that didn't already exist in 2009.  ",
