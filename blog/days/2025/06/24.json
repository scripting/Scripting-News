Here's <a href=\"https://herve.bzh/wordpress-wordland-and-the-open-web/\">what he said</a> about yesterday's <a href=\"https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html\">podcast</a>. He liked the idea of WordPress as the OS of the open social web. Glad that resonated. It has so much more than the other possible platforms. The others couldn't even realistically claim to be part of the web. They don't support writers very well. We're going to build slowly and deliberately around this idea, always staying open for competitors, because that's the most important thing about the web, beyond its simplicity, it <i>never</i> locks its users in. That's a deal-stopper. As I've learned how WordPress works internally, I immediately saw that they embraced the concepts of the web not just as words, but in their practice. I never hit a wall that kept me out of doing something they already did. And they also appear to never break users and developers. That's one of the basic rules of the web, it's an unchanging thing, no one can break it because everyone is a <a href=\"https://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">guest</a>. Anyway, there is only one web. Keep that in mind. Nothing exclusive about it. ",
