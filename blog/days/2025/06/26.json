Funny thing is Krugman <i>did</i> get it, a few weeks ago when the crisis in Los Angeles was peaking. He wrote a <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/this-is-not-a-drill\">piece</a> that was terrified, and realistic. The National Guard had been nationalized. Marines were invading California.

Here's what I say. Forget about ever rising from the ashes of what remains of the party. Right now, the issue is how to defend the city from the coming war with the US government. They're already holding the current mayor hostage. This will be worse than 9-11 and Covid. We have no leadership. We're totally fucked, what the Democratic Party does or doesn't do, at this point, simply doesn't matter.",
