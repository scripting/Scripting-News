            "text": "I was lucky to grow up in NYC, and had to commute from Queens to the Bronx every day to go to school. Some days I took the <a href=\"https://bustime.mta.info/m/?q=Q44-SBS&l=\">Q44</a> bus over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx%E2%80%93Whitestone_Bridge\">Whitestone Bridge</a>, and other days I took the <a href=\"https://bustime.mta.info/m/index;jsessionid=9F7ADE234676D22B101A192CAA31C55E?q=Q16&l=&t=&cacheBreaker=1717915338805\">Q16</a> to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(New_York_City_Subway_service)\">7 train</a> through Manhattan, and then the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(New_York_City_Subway_service)\">4</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(New_York_City_Subway_service)\">D trains</a> up to 205th St in the Bronx. Took the same amount of time either way. So at age 15 I was able to go see the Grateful Dead after school at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillmore_East\">Fillmore East</a> on April 27, 1971. Midway through the set, a special guest band who they didn't introduce started tuning up on stage. We all wondered who they were. I now know the history thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=500+Songs+podcast+beach+boys\">500 Songs podcast</a>, and this was the return of a band that had fallen out of favor, a band whose hits we all heard on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC_(AM)#The_Musicradio_77_era_(1960%E2%80%931982)\">WABC</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#%22Where_Rock_Lives%22\">WNEW-FM</a>. When they started playing one of their biggest hits, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations\">Good Vibrations</a>, the audience erupted in ecstasy. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys\">The Beach Boys</a> now looking a lot different, but playing the same wonderful California music from the 60s. They couldn't be more different from the Dead, but there they were up on stage together. They were back, this time for good. This is a recording of the whole concert, the link <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kRKY-S4wI1s?si=zTwSE5tvk6LKNjjb&t=2348\">points</a> to the beginning of Good Vibrations. You can hear the gasp of recognition, and the bands recognition of the recognition, and from their it was a party in a party, including a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRKY-S4wI1s&t=2508s\">sing-along part</a> -- \"gotta keep those a lovin' good vibrations happening with you.\" We were all growing up very quickly, but we had a moment when we could return to a more innocent time. Lovely the way music pulls you back in time. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson\">Brian Wilson</a> wasn't there that night but his music certainly was. ",

It's true, speaking as a man who has been voting solid Democratic since Kerry, but I didn't stop being a man, which is something that makes me cringe to say it, the way I cringed at admitting to being Jewish when I was a kid. I lived in a place where hate of Jews was always just under the surface in school, but not so well hidden at the playground. ",

The truth I didn't dare say was it was a huge hate campaign as divisive as anything the Repubs ever did. In a country that was supposed to outlaw this, and from a political party that was supposed to be liberal. The \"both sides do it\" reality probably hasn't yet sunk in but the Democrats sided with sadists and fascists. No other way to put it. Men absolutely were silenced. Afraid to speak for fear of retribution. If you were on the wrong side of this you have some soul-searching to do. And you probably pushed a lot of people of all genders into voting for Trump. The Dems posture of \"who me?\" has an answer -- yes you. ",
