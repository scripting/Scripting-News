You get to it through the Reading Lists <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/09/feedCorpsScreenShot.png?nodialog\">sub-menu</a> of the Tools menu. There are three lists in the new version. A lot were false starts, they didn't make the cut. I'm always adding feeds to my blogroll and news.scripting.com. Unfortunately I can't say the same for podcasts, which are not hooked up to my podcast app. I really want a hot connection there. We'll get there. The reading lists feature is going to play a big role going forward in the open social web we're building. BTW, I really like the name <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=feedcorps\">FeedCorps</a>. I haven't talked about it very much. It's a cause, like peace or freedom. Open those suckas up. Feeds all the way babe.",

Here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325\">writeup</a> with a place to comment and perhaps to collaborate on doing this for real. ChatGPT has real limits. This has to be done off on the side. It certainly could be done with their API. I'm head-down on other projects and can't do it myself but as I explain in the writeup, it would plug in beautifully to stuff I'm doing and it would all be open, so a new kind of feed reader is possible. And we could find news from other bloggers that the journalists aren't reporting on, the same way we relied on blogs in the early days to learn about what was going on on the web. It's time to do that again. ",
