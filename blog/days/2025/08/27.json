On the web seemed relatively easy. But of the web is a bit more elusive. Until <a href=\"https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601\">Ken Smith</a> found <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way\">this quote</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson\">Ted Nelson</a> in the original 1989 proposal by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for what would become the web. \"Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way.\" I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for <a href=\"https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/\">weblog</a>, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is \"unconstrained.\" If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.  ",
