Another case in point, the <a href=\"https://socialwebfoundation.org/\">Social Web Foundation</a>, which is about ActivityPub and the Fediverse, when there are many other forms of the social web. Here's where the rubber meets the road. They're having a meeting in Brussels where people can demo their social web apps, but it's only about ActivityPub. If you have a project for Bluesky, or Threads, or non-ActivityPub Mastodon, or \"RSS\" for that matter, you should feel welcome there, regardless of what their <a href=\"https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/11/01/fosdem-2025-social-web-devroom-call-for-participation/\">Call For Participation</a> says.
