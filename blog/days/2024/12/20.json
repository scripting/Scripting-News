The feature I want is when you paste a URL and there's a selection, the selected text is turned into a link. A video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQQPTlpNZQ\">explanation</a>. I've burned two full sessions on this, seeking advice from ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. They all pretend to know what to do, but in fact they don't. The clipboard is one of those areas of the browser that is held together with rumors and confusion, as is MediumEditor, and the intersection is rumors and confusion squared. Tomorrow I'm going to work on other things, and the day after until I have an idea for another way to approach this. I really want this feature because apparently it's supported in Slack, WordPress and other software that supports links. ",

RSS and WordPress are a powerful distribution system. Lots of software works with those two protocols, as do many programmers, and they're both marvelously open, stable over more than twenty years each, and <i>can't</i> be owned by billionaires. Pretty powerful place, kind of amazing that there's so much room here, and the people are friendly. :smile:",
