Justice reminds Beane how much he's paying him, and Beane says I'm going to tell it to you straight -- half your salary is being paid by the Yankees. Think about it. They're paying all that money for you to play <i>against</i> them. That's how I feel about Fox. How much will it cost to get them to STFU. Whatever it is it's worth it.",

More people would develop feed-using apps if they knew about this package. I just want more people to develop around feeds. \n",
