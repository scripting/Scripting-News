How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more <i>fluidity. </i>Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't. So they got all the casual writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I think it's time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on features and lock-in. ",
