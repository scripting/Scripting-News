I’m not a copypaste machine. Technically, it’s an easy problem to solve, and I don’t see how it hurts various tech companies to let users  write  in  their  favorite  editor.  This  is  severely  limiting  what  we  can  do  with  networks,  and  there  seems  to  be  no  reason  for  it.  APIs  let  us  build  networks  out  of software.  Devs,  take  a  chance  on  other  developers.  Let  the  web  expand.  Let the web breathe.\"",
