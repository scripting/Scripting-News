But, as Keith Olbermann spells out so well in his latest <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/garland-must-stop-hurs-plans-to-testify-to-house-gop-2-13-24/id1633301179?i=1000645128033\">Countdown</a>, if he were to step aside that would basically concede the election to Trump. So if you think the old man is being silly and vain, well, he's being a lot smarter than you are, and btw, paying a huge price. If you live to be 81, I bet the last thing you want to do, after the life he's had, is to be in this position. We should get behind him, and tell him so, let him know we don't want anyone else, and we want him to be happy, healthy and know that the smart, good people of the US appreciate what he's doing for all of us.
