Would I feel differently if I knew a work of art that I found inspiring was created by an AI. At first I said no, because what matters in art is how it is received, not how it was created. What effect did it have on the viewer. That's the art. But then I remembered that when I found out that Wordle was edited by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle#:~:text=In%20November%202022%2C%20the%20Times,checks%20each%20word%20for%20suitability.\">human</a>, that the words were chosen by a person not at random, I found the game less interesting, because certain words obviously would be eliminated from consideration, even though they are in the dictionary and are used in normal writing and speech. I found myself guessing at who the editor is, and that's not why I play Wordle. I don't know why, but understanding this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Bennett\">person</a> isn't it.
