I have a feeling that when I develop software it's a lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there's more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It's like \"even worse than it appears.\" Still diggin is meant to say we know it's really futile, you don't have to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we feel somehow that next time it really will work. It's a Vonnegut-like or Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other words, realistic. ",

Not some fancy media critic opinion or an editorial. A real report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability.\" A regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her liking, she accused me of being a MAGA. It's so totally not true, and typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to a non-journalist opinion about journalism. ",

I love journalism <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html\">like I love the Mets</a>. I don't expect them to do great things every season, but I do hope for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season\">1969</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season\">1986</a> every once in a while. These days I don't have much hope for the NYT returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing. ",
