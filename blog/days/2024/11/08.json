It manages news streams for feeds you subscribe to. I think every publication should share news from feeds they depend on, experts they quote, other news sources they read. We can build our own networks this way. We've done it before and can do it again. The advantage of this approach is that it is truly decentralized and not at all complicated to use. Here's the <a href=\"https://news.scripting.com/\">news stream</a> I provide for readers of my blog. It's the most popular feature on the site. With FeedLand you can <a href=\"https://docs.feedland.com/newsproducts.md\">create your own</a>. ",

Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. <b>We were not part of governing</b>. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama. This is probably the biggest single mistake the Dems keep making.",
