            "text": "<a href=\"https://lists.opml.org/\">lists.opml.org</a>: The other day I asked a famous blogger who uses RSS if he would be willing to share his list of feeds, so others could subscribe to them. He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he couldn't share. I certainly understand that. Then I realized, as often is the case, that I could do myself what I had been asking others to do. And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people who didn't use \"FeedLand\" wouldn't know <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png\">how to find</a> them. So I decided to make it easier. On <a href=\"https://lists.opml.org/\">lists.opml.org</a> I've got a link to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/podcasts.opml\">lists of podcasts</a> I'm subscribed to. That list should update every hour for any additions or removals from this list. I don't update the list very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me know if you do, I'd love to see what you do. ",

They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. ",
