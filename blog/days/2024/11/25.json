That value wasn't priced into <a href=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/twtr\">TWTR</a> stock. No one listened. Here's the next installment. The US government acquires Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The \"constitution\" reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems, they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been <i>cartelized,</i> which is one step beyond <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/11/22/214100.html\">enshitified</a>. ",

Today there are so many twitter-like systems that are useful, people want to cross-post. If I'm writing something I plan to cross-post, and I pass the 300-char limit, but I'm not finished, what to do. These days generally I view 500 as the actual limit, which means when my cross-poster tries to publish to Bluesky it fails. We should be trying to coalesce on an idea of what a text document is in the mid-late 20s. I've put my <a href=\"https://textcasting.org/\">proposal</a> out.",
