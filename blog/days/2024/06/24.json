But I just learned that UTM might work. Here’s the <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/38d87439-9a34-402d-9c46-7a047e7e2866\">transcript</a> of my inquiry. Wondering if <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/112671088952473981\">anyone has had good experience</a> using UTM to run older Mac software on Apple CPUs.",

It's all everyone's fault, so why bother voting, is mostly what they say. SMH in disbelief.",

We should learn from this and not repeat the same mistake, and of course until the real story is out, we can't learn from it. Let's get it right on the Wikipedia page. It isn't about Guha or Libby, me, or whoever. It's really about the power of Netscape and the early web news publishing companies that supported RSS, and the blogging systems that jumped on board (including my own products) and then two years later, the NYT coming on board, followed by the entire news industry. A bunch of nerds arguing on a mail list is <i>not</i> the story. With the benefit of well over twenty years hindsight this should, by now, be kind of obvious. ",
