My times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are now six. I bet all the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298\">other</a> systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the creation date of the item, and they changed.

I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family.
