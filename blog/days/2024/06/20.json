We don't do that in the open formats and protocols world. What really pains me is they claim to follow <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/\">my</a> Rules for Standards-makers. Imho they do not. Two rules apply. <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000\">Rule #1</a> says the only reason we do this is interop. It's called Rule #1 for a reason. And the <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000\">one way</a> rule a little further down the page. I've seen this happen twice where people say they abide by the <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/\">RFSM</a> but then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the name you've chosen. We've been down this path. The only way it ends is in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/134901.html?title=standardsKitty\">tears</a>. ",

For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that would have worked if I hadn't made a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601\">mistake</a> in GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say \"Hey readers dump your cache now, let's start over, because I fcuked up.\" It wouldn't have mattered anyway, I'm sure none of them would listen, right? ",
