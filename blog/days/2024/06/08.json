Rated 83 on Metacritic (a must-see). I was excited! Watched it. It's like a TV sitcom. Ugh. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/112581268426914314\">Zzzzz</a>. The main character has a nice-Brad Pitt like smile. Wears weird constumes. Finds a beautiful girlfriend. Best thing about it is that it takes place in New Orleans, so I could try to figure out where they were. That's about it. Much better implementation of a similar idea -- <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/emily-the-criminal/\">Emily the Criminal</a>. ",

This is what all the chat companies are trying, but the one in the best position to do this is OpenAI, because they have the top rung in the <a href=\"https://samples.jbpub.com/9781449622213/Chapter19.pdf\">positioning ladder</a> for AI apps. It's where most of us go for our AI. Like Visicalc which had the top rung of the spreadsheet ladder until Lotus 1-2-3 took over, which was then knocked off the top rung by Excel. This is why they have to move forward aggressively, it's the way tech works. Before too long all the chat apps with have their AI bots in the loop and it will be too late for OpenAI to dominate. But right now they are the obvious choice for this. The place <s>you</s> <i>we</i> go to AI. ",
