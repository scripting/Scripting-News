Started out simple, and over years it turned into a TTIM. Perfect example. Someone should study it, to figure out why Sun, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle et al wanted a protocol for interop and invested years in it, and yet it returned little in the way of interop.  I know that \"XML-RPC\" is still in use, I imagine that SOAP probably is too, in some form. I wonder how it shook out. On the other hand \"RSS\" wasn't turned into a nightmare, and has become a <i>productive</i> tech industry mess, the most unusual thing ever, a true unicorn. ",
