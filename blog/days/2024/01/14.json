I was part of the PC wave in the 80s when writing tools advanced incredibly quickly. So many directions -- from line-oriented editors on Unix and early Apples, to <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/0cfe7783-d6aa-4350-9d32-f9a81efc8e4b\">screen editors</a>, then with the Mac we got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG\">wizzy</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress\">page</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker\">layout</a>, and outliners for thinking and presentations.
