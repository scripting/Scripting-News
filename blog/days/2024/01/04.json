I have one for my development work, general notes, not project-specific. And tabs for all the projects I've been working on in the last few days or in some cases weeks or months. From a writing standpoint, it doesn't matter whether they're on different sites, the idea of a site is not even in the user interface of my editor. In WordPress it's everything. The usual caveat: unless I'm missing something. I imagine people use browser tabs to work on more than one document at a time? I keep thinking there's a lot of stuff we can do to make WordPress work better for writers, I'm trying to be nice about this, but it doesn't work at all for me as a writer. I want it to work. I still can't believe there aren't a dozen different approaches to writing in WordPress. Seems like a fair amount of innovation is possible. I'm a writer who also is a developer. This has been bugging me for the last year or so. Why do I think WordPress is so important? 1. Obviously it has a huge installed base. If there's an opportunity to create something that even a small number of them would like, it's worth doing. 2. WordPress is the only product out there that supports <i>all</i> the features of \"textcasting\". So If I want lots of outlets for basic text writing, you have to start somewhere. Luckily there's WordPress, sitting there, ready to be recast as a social media app. If you know me, you know I <i>love</i> puzzles like this. :smile:",
