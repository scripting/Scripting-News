GitHub has a better model for text with comments, supports full Markdown the way it was meant to work. I have an instance of Masto that I can use that supports Markdown but they do an <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/16/thisIsNotALegitWayToDisplayALink.png\">unacceptable</a> rendering of links. <a href=\"https://social.masto.land/@dave/112971999302900967\">Example post</a>. I want a simple, widely accepted easy place to comment, on the social web, not Discourse or GitHub, that isn't controlled by one vendor (so ActivityPub for now is probably the best approach) and supports plain old Markdown without any weird embellishments. I don't work in the Mastodon world, I'm already committed to the projects I'm doing. But we could really use something nice, designed to plug into blogs. This is a good use-case, and it's pretty close. ",
