They have two more games to play with the Braves, but there's a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/25/atlantaWeather.png\">hurricane</a> headed <a href=\"https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=33.7485&lon=-84.3915\">toward</a> Atlanta. It's going to start raining at 1PM and won't stop until Friday afternoon. It's the end of the season and both the Braves and Mets are in the same wildcard battle. Do the Mets stay in Atlanta to ride out the storm, or head back to NY? It's far more weird than I have time to explain right now.",
