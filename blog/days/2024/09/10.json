He started on the Mets in their inaugural year, 1962. They went from the worst team ever to World Champions in record time. They became the heroes of NYC in 1969. I was riding the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Flushing,+NY+11358/The+Bronx+High+School+of+Science,+West+205th+Street,+The+Bronx,+NY/@40.8244197,-73.952697,12z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f39fba19f047:0x456fa7ab9f9bae18!2m2!1d-73.8913029!2d40.8779204!3e3!5i4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\">subway</a> back then to get from Flushing to the Bronx to go to school, and in the Bronx, when the Mets won, everyone was smiling. If you've ever been to NYC you know how unusual that is. And in the Bronx, which is of course where the always-hated Yankees were HQ'd. Ed Kranepool <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/sports/no-one-a-met-more-through-and-through-than-ed-kranepool/\">died</a> Sunday. He was watching a Mets game when he had a heart attack. ",
