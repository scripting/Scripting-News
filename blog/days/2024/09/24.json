ActivityPub is not the web any more than Dan Quayle was Jack Kennedy. The web is simple. That was hard to do. Very little since then lives up to that standard of simplicity, definitely not ActivityPub. The web is the web is the web is the web etc. Pick another more humble name. If it ever does achieve the utility of the web does we can take another look.",

Judges with the power of life and death. In some states with the death penalty judges have the power to sentence people to death, but not for having a well-accepted medical procedure. But that's the situation women with a troubled pregnancy are in, if they live in the wrong state. From the patient's point of view, I have a slight inkling about what this is like because twice in my life I've needed health care to save me from imminent death. The health care system never hesitated to help. But what if they had said \"we can't admit you until a judge rules that we can.\" In the new USA, abortion is like a pardon, something only the government can grant. Forget about juries of our peers. It raises so many questions. If a woman is about to miscarry are they even allowed to admit her to the hospital, or does she have to wait until she is actually dying? If you can check her in, what are the limits of the treatment they can provide? Aspirin? Blood? Oxygen? Surgery? And btw, medicine has advanced a <i>lot</i> since before Roe v Wade. Whatever practices they had for avoiding abortion can't apply now. This is the kind of thing no society should change the way we changed it as an edict handed down by judges who are subject to corruption. We are learning about a serious flaw in our system of government. ",

I knew how to use it, but I didn't know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense, because they talked about things I didn't understand. What I really needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how to use. I found one, a service provided by <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html\">Ohio State University</a>. You emailed a message to them and they put it \"on the web\" and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and there's what you typed. I tried <i>Hello World</i> and got back a link to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated, I did a view source of Hotwired.com's home page, and copy and pasted it into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were relative). ",

I know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We're all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I hear there's some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don't care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the same kind of aha moment I had with the web.
