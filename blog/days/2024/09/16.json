I started out that way 40+ years ago, and somewhere along the line I stopped thinking that way. If you can, watch <a href=\"https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-bear/video-extras/video/64beaaa830c49e0001e758d8\">S02 E07</a> to see what I mean. It's about service, the connection between the staff and the people who come to eat, and the medium is the food. It's the same idea. There's so much cynicism around tech, and I hate that. We've rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians. But it should be much more than that. ",
