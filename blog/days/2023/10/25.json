He now works at Automattic, makers of WordPress. We're both old enough to remember Filemaker and PFS:File which were user-oriented databases for the Mac and PC in the 1980s. It was a new idea then because there were no easy-to-use file management products on minicomputers, these were products for users of personal computers. I wondered it there wasn't a position for a lite version of WordPress, a user interface designed for one person, not a group. I created a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/274\">prototype</a> of what I call <i>WordPress-for-One</i> as part of a project to get support for the WordPress API into my codebase. It's just enough WordPress for one writer. That's the idea.",

The thing you have to go for is actual code that reads as clearly as pseudo-code. In JavaScript you are so far from that. Every little loop requires you to do a dance that's a pain in the ass when you're writing the code, it's 100 times worse when you're trying to find the bug that's hiding in the freaking haystack. But -- you can do it. ",
