Then things like the relatively huge corner-turn I'm doing with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html\">reading lists</a> would be less of a mind fuck. I'll get there, but I don't like the stack I'm working in, the browser and its ridiculousness, then JavaScript and its idea of program synchrozation and structure, then HTTP which is simple enough, but of course Google couldn't leave that alone, and then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js\">JavaScript again</a>, and then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\">SQL</a> where, instead of calling into another stack, you write scripts, send them over the wire. At least what you get back is a JavaScript object, imagine if everyone had to parse the text result that I'm sure SQL must send back. None of this history has been factored or smoothed out, yet we can get something as clever as \"FeedLand\" running.
