But of course we think about whether it's the best way to do something, but the fact that users chose a way is important. Because our software is meant to empower them. I don't like software developers who think of themselves as above the users. Not a constructive way to do our art, imho. ",

When you push an idea into the world it should feel powerful not laborious. When the process of writing and revising is trouble, the writing is troubled. I find sometimes it <i>is</i> tedious, like arranging the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/10/24/122615.html\">delicious artwork</a> that DALLE made for me (and you), but that always inspires me, as a software developer, to look for ways to smooth the process. We call that paving cow paths, and that's my process. So let's do it. Take Tantek's vision, which we share, and make it work, for real. In the case of blog-peering, we can learn from podcasting and make the <a href=\"http://textcasting.org/\">sharing process</a> for writing as smooth. ",

To the extent that my software is art, it is all about the user. What do you create with my outliner and news manager? You and us. What do we create together? That's the art. The art continues long after I've stopped coding. It starts when you recall an idea you had last Tuesday and improve on it, and relate it to someone else's idea next week and in 2029.  ",
