It wasn't meant to be a sweeping statement, or a forever thing. It was over <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/0041fbe8-b00e-478a-88d2-c3427abb6913\">ten years ago</a>. RSS was hurt by what Google did, anyone who says otherwise isn't dealing well with reality. On the other hand, I've spent the last two years on building <a href=\"https://feedland.org/\">new software</a> for feeds, so obviously I don't feel it's over, actually I think it's is exactly what we need to sew the open social media world together. Small pieces loosely joined. RSS, and formats that came after it, are all about weaving a loosely joined web of blog posts and news articles. If we want it to work, we can make it work. ",
