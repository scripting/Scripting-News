Intermittent internet access. Great to meet all kinds of old friends. The memories are strong. Tomorrow is another travel day, returning to the mountains, and then Murphy-willing, head-down on a new product release.",

But BKC turned in a different direction, focusing on people who studied the internet, rather than people who made the internet. ",

He's talking about how to regulate AI, with the assumption that it's a looming catastrophe, without explaining why he feels that way, or why we should. As a reader of this blog you certainly know that I am very optimistic about the future of AI.",
