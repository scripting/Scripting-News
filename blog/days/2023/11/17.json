The consensus seems to be that we should use the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt\">enclosure</a> element, as with podcasting. In this case, if the type begins with \"image/\" then an <i>artcast</i> viewer should handle it, and others should ignore it. We were at this place with podcasting in 2001, and needed some examples, so we had a feed of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml\">Grateful Dead music</a> to start using the technology. Here's the artcasting <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/artfeed.xml\">test feed</a>. Try subscribing to it in a feed reader you like. Hopefully it either ignores the enclosure or it does the right thing with it, displays it. Here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278\">thread</a> for comments, questions and screen shots. ",
