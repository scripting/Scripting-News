But I have to just as strongly <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/Cz068Apuycp\">disagree with him</a> about OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. I don't go for hype in tech, I'm very much a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri#Etymology_and_pronunciation\">Show Me</a> kind of guy. Every time I think of a new use for ChatGPT I'm blown away by what a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/09/14/130813.html\">breakthrough</a> it is. Not just impressive tech, which it certainly is, but how incredibly useful it is. And how it understands my questions. And its infinite patience and good manners. I'm not trying to change Jeff's mind, but just to say I think my friend got this one wrong. ",
