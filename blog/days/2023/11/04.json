I know there are services that take care of all the logins. But I don't know who they are, the people, investors, and what they do with the data that flows through their systems. But there's another reason, I've known <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> since it was founded, I knew <a href=\"https://ma.tt/\">Matt</a> when he arrived in San Francisco in the early 00s, and have worked on a few projects with him and people at the company, and I respect him and the company he's built. I've written a lot about the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/20/couldS3BeAnEnduserProduct.html\">kind</a> of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131043\">identity systems</a> we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/05/06/141135.html\">need</a> to foster development. Right now the economics are such that in order to ship a simple product you have to raise VC money. But technologically, if users could buy storage, instead having individual developers buy it and resell it to them, we could get back to a time when an individual could make a hit product. You don't know how important that is. Products made by companies never take the creative risks that individuals can. That's why innovation in social media was stuck for 17 years with Twitter's idea of a post. Anyway -- I know that Google, Facebook and Apple would never listen to me, but Automattic does. So I'm willing to meet them in the middle. Okay let's see what we can do with this login thing. It's in \"FeedLand\" now. :smile:",

I learned some fundamental things about abuse, don't offer people a way to abuse you and you won't be abused. It means don't think of this as a conversational medium, and don't count on everyone hearing you. Use it for thinking out loud, and be happy when people hear you, but don't expect it.",

I haven't found many writers who are thinking about that, but imho they <i>all</i> should be, esp right now when the dominance of tech companies is so iffy, when the possibilities are so open. I write software for writers, so I exist to make Tim happy. I want to be sure he can use the writing tools he loves (btw, maybe more than one, for different kinds of writing). ",
