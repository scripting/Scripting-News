The advantage is it will scale like the most popular websites, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> does. There have been lots of internal changes in the software, but at the same time, it still runs on a $10 a month <a href=\"https://feedland.org/\">Digital Ocean server</a>, and on desktops as well. The next FeedLand works at all these levels, for a person, a workgroup and the world. Obviously, lots more to say about all this. :smile:",

Yesterday I asked <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/11/11/013609.html\">ChatGPT to draw</a> me a image of an ancient band performing in the desert with cacti as the audience. Then this morning I had the idea of moving the concert into the pond behind my house, except this time <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/12/concertInThePond.png\">the audience are frogs</a>. I have a private Facebook group where I tell the story of the pond, including the animals who come to visit. Some of them I invent, they don't actually exist. And they have relationships with each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and relationships. And other people's models could incorporate mine. This was an idea I had for SimCity, and the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+world+outline\">web of outlines</a>, neither of which happened. Maybe it'll happen in LLM-land.",

People I knew in from high school, New Orleans, Madison, Palo Alto, Cambridge and Berkeley, NYC and Woodstock. Even people I knew as a child. People I only or mostly know virtually. Imho, people who won't use Facebook miss out. Its greatest feature are the people who use it. It's the kind of village we yearn for, at a DNA level. People you will never stop loving. I don't think I've ever mentioned this group on the blog, but maybe I should do that more, because it's a uniquely civilized, friendly and soul-nourishing online place, at least for me.  ",
