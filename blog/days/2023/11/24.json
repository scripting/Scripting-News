Maybe the most American holiday of all. But it's also a time to be jolly and kind, nice not naughty, doing our part to consume at ever-increasing rates to keep the US economy humming. And it's a time for love, one hopes. Even so it's time to put <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/325a58fa-1957-47f3-833f-f34b4151721b\">Santa</a> in his place, in the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/24/santaInTheMargin.png\">margin</a> of Scripting News! I did my part today, buying a nice curved monitor for my Mac mini, and a new smaller TV for the den. Socks and a couple of nice shirts.",

And the <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/returnlinkbloghtml?url=http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml\">linkblog</a> will be the next tab. Then the tabs from <a href=\"http://news.scripting.com/\">news.scripting.com</a> followed by the About page <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/aboutpage.opml\">outline</a>. And lots of room for growth, for new ideas for writers and readers. As always I use my own site to experiment with new web ideas. ",
