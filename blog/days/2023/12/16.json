A bunch of my pieces really pissed him off, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/11/howInvestigativeResearchHa.html\">like this one</a>. You didn't have to guess where you stood with him. And he listened when you told him he was all fucked up and full of it and didn't understand the first thing about what you said. He was from Alaska and I am from the east and west coasts. We were friends. I'lll miss his caustic and broad dismissals. I knew then and now that his heart was in it, and it is a good heart. <span style=\"opacity: 0.4\">:heart:</span>",

He's a great talker and story-teller and philosopher, and a great human being. I had never heard him interviewed before, or read anything written by him, but I watched all his TV shows in the 70s. The people in them were people from my neighborhood, but funnier. Why should it be surprising that the stories this man told in real life were the same ones he told in his scripts. Now I want to find more interviews with him. Great stuff.  ",
