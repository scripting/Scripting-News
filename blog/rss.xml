			<description>Peeve: A podcast uses a siren as a sound effect. It causes panic when driving. &quot;Where's the siren!&quot; the driver looks everywhere, only to realize it was just the podcast. This has happened a few times, this time I remembered to say something.</description>

			<title>Using Claude to write software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just had a fairly incredible experience using &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than write up the work we did, I asked Claude to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave started by sharing a text outline of computing platforms (Mac, iOS, Windows, Unix and their variants) and asked if I could visualize it. I began with a simple mindmap diagram using Mermaid. Then Dave showed me a more sophisticated design with rounded rectangles and arrows, so I adapted my approach and created a matching SVG version.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The most interesting moment came when Dave casually asked if I could turn this into a Node.js package. This was an audacious request - moving from a single visualization to a complete, reusable software package - but it was exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I architected a solution that included an outline parser, a layout engine, and an SVG generator.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I particularly enjoyed designing the two-pass layout algorithm. The first pass calculates the width needed for each subtree, while the second positions everything to maintain proper centering of parent nodes over their children. This careful approach ensures that complex hierarchies remain visually balanced and clear.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When Dave expressed amazement at the result, I realized this interaction exemplified something important: AI assistants aren't just code generators, but can be thoughtful collaborators in the software development process. We can help translate between different representations - from text to visuals to reusable software - while maintaining a focus on clean design and extensibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet packaged up the code it gave me, but when I do, I'll put a link here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/treechart/index.html&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that generated the tree I asked Claude to render. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, as a longtime speaker of English &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; programmer, I think the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring&quot;&gt;refactoring&lt;/a&gt; is re-dundant. The term comes from mathematics where you simplify a statement without altering its truth. Factoring is a repetitive process. You factor, and then factor some more if you can.</description>

			<description>The problem with everyone who says you have to get off Twitter is that we're giving up the meeting place we had and spreading all the bits into the wind. Are you going to leave the United States now that Trump is going to be president again? Leaving Twitter is a lot like that. How do you know Musk isn't going to have to sell it? Might happen. How would you feel then about having quit Twitter in a huff as if it would always be the bastion of assholes. It's a mistake. He isn't making money with it. The more you use it the more it costs him, btw. By leaving you might actually be helping him survive. Nothing is so linear, first big point. Second big point, no one cares about your gestures.</description>

			<description>If you think &lt;i&gt;woke&lt;/i&gt; is the problem, try reading the US Constitution and amendments. Really read them. Pretend you didn't know it was the Constitution.

			<description>Last night's email had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1mXNfI1cbU&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; in it. I had forgotten that they get lost somewhere in the email delivery supply chain, so the fire that I put in the email was &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/27/emailscreen.png&quot;&gt;not transmitted&lt;/a&gt;. It's even worse than it appears. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1mXNfI1cbU&quot;&gt;link to the video&lt;/a&gt; of the fire, with any luck that will get through in tonight's email. Happy holidays everyone!</description>

Remarkable progress. Far beyond what we were doing in the very stagnant Web 2.0 world. They're still stuck on whether or not our writing can have titles. So bizarre to exist in a world that is deliberately hobbled, and another with infinite horizons. Anyway this is what I'm thinking about just before hunkering down with my Knicks and popcorn, a Christmas tradition for many many years. Ho ho ho.</description>

			<description>Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. It was what I needed to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, it defines its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of. Defining a new network where if you want to play you'll need to start thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can't be on the open web and be a silo.

			<description>I have a fairly large and old &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier&quot;&gt;C application&lt;/a&gt; that was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.</description>

It needs to scale very quickly. Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and quickly understood as parallel to Twitter.

			<description>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end while a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef&quot;&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt; has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from. Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in the 60s,. You would have missed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles&quot;&gt;all that followed&lt;/a&gt;. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the 2020s. That story is far from over.</description>

These guys should all be using the same protocol. It's a travesty that each of them considers their product to define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; -- they don't understand the first thing about the web, what the miracle the web was. Before the web, the tech world was as it is now, fragmented by huge companies that didn't care about anything but their own internal drama. The last thing they would consider was reusing something that was already running. While all that was going on Unix basically agreed on a core set of functions that formed a basis for interop. They weren't perfect, there were differences in each of the Unixes, but you could reuse most of what you knew on each of the platforms. But Apple, Microsoft, Sun and IBM each ran their own ecosystems. And then one day along came the web. Instead of bookshelves of docs, it wasn't even a booklet. You could be up and running with a &quot;website&quot; in ten minutes. I speak from experience. My first website was authored with a freaking email. Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon are the IBM, Microsoft and Apple of 2024. It's ridiculous if they think this is a web. To paraphrase the late great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgtfEX2Pka0&amp;t=65s&quot;&gt;Lloyd Bentsen&lt;/a&gt;, I knew the web, the web was a friend of mine.

They all pretend to know what to do, but in fact they don't. The clipboard is one of those areas of the browser that is held together with rumors and confusion, as is MediumEditor, and the intersection is rumors and confusion squared. Tomorrow I'm going to work on other things, and the day after until I have an idea for another way to approach this. I really want this feature because apparently it's supported in Slack, WordPress and other software that supports links.</description>

Ours is slightly bigger, and grows as your piece gets longer. Neatly arranged like the others, and all your writing flows through WordPress and RSS, where each of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;TLTBs&lt;/a&gt; only flows into their limited and incompatible views of the social web. RSS and WordPress are a powerful distribution system. Lots of software works with those two protocols, as do many programmers, and they're both marvelously open, stable over more than twenty years each, and &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; be owned by billionaires. Pretty powerful place, kind of amazing that there's so much room here, and the people are friendly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Amazing that the tech industry hasn't tried to retrieve its reputation from the ones who are repping us in DC nowadays. Software doesn't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to treat their users like nobodies. Quite the opposite. I come from the school that says our users are the smartest most powerful people in the world and it's our privilege to create tools for them.</description>

			<description>One more thing. I love taking the time to craft a delicious piece of software. I have never really done that in the 50 years I've been doing this. This time I decided there's no rush.

			<description>I'm thinking maybe we'll do a Kickstarter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. It'll cost money to run the server and continue to develop the sofware. It fills a big enough need to ask the users to support it financially, at least to get it off the ground. The server is open source so theoretically anyone can run one. But in practice most people will probably just want to use the service. I just want to solve this problem so we can start building a developer ecosystem around WordPress that it's never had. Think of WordLand as a pump primer. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber&quot;&gt;Ari Melber&lt;/a&gt; last night and noted he isn't yet on Bluesky or hasn't updated his show graphics to include it? He usually tries to be leading edge in this, and at this point he looks a bit behind the times, imho, ymmv etc. After Melber, I stayed through the opening segment of Joy Reid and was charged up by her intro. She's clicking on all cylinders. They must be thinking about gutting or reconfiguring MSNBC at this time. It's up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/01/msnbc-comcast-cable-news-for-sale-elon-musk-trump&quot;&gt;for sale&lt;/a&gt;, I wonder if a billionaire will see the wisdom of owning that piece of real estate as Musk saw the value in Twitter, far beyond what the stock market valued it at. (BTW, I should add that I benefited from his largesse, I was a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/15/0295.html&quot;&gt;small shareholder&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter at the time. I did not want to sell, but my vote didn't matter. Heh.)</description>

I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md&quot;&gt;added that&lt;/a&gt; to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown, it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT. It's such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it's happening. And what a delight that it has an API. I don't mind that I'm paying for it, I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that couldn't have been created before.</description>

			<description>What could journalism do to help the country? Move your shows out into the red territories. Make it a requirement that Chris and Joy, Lawrence or Rachel, if they want to stay on the air, have to broadcast from one of the red states. It could be a large city in a red state. The reason is symbolic and practical. The red state voters wouldn't be such a mystery if you knew some of them from your everyday life. And you might have a few of them on the show. You have some selling to do, the idea you're selling is that you care about the people you don't know.</description>

			<description>I'm farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free. The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I'm not sure how or if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it's good for. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in my app it takes a half minute.

			<source:outline text="I'm farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free. The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I'm not sure how or if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it's good for. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in my app it takes a half minute.

Anyway, I was daydreaming about what I'd do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt; if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that Netflix thinks I'd like, because their idea of what I'd like is bullshit. I find that I'll like almost anything that's rated in the 80s by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I'll give almost any NYT &lt;i&gt;critics choice&lt;/i&gt; a go. So what I really want in the middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well. Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway, then &lt;i&gt;boom&lt;/i&gt; it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345&quot;&gt;in the outliner&lt;/a&gt; could actually do this. Now I'm going to need to be able to call ChatGPT from a Node app.</description>

			<title>Online communities can work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/14/magazine/bluesky-social-media.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in today's NYT said all networks flame out, but that's actually too crude a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want your network not to flame out, give the users the tools to keep things moderated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of Facebook is it gives the author of a post the power to decide who can respond to it. (I know they're not the only ones, but they're the first in my experience, so I give them credit.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I write something that I know will attract trolls, I just restrict it to friends. If they flame me, or even try to provoke an argument, I just unfriend them, and I suspect they know that. The hotheads have been culled from the list over time, there's trust that people don't want and won't pick fights. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assume adults know when they're asking to argue, and not only don't accept the bait, but don't allow them to participate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Keeps things friendly. Not kidding. It doesn't flame out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also helps that I've been using these networks since the 70s, and there have been times when I sought out the flames, because I could have shut them off at any time, but I let them keep going. Now I don't. I just don't argue online, and as a result the heat doesn't reach me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you give people good tools, and they use them well, you can make this work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: To be fair, the NYT piece focused on Bluesky, and they are for sure going down a path much like the one Twitter went down, but it will happen much faster because the trolls are already plentiful and well-organized. They're going for the billion-dollar cashout, for sure and they will very likely get it, and as users we will still be looking for an open system that we can use to get work done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mid-day ramble</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a moment a couple of years ago when Mastodon was gaining traction in a serious way when I thought that Automattic should do something publicly to demonstrate support for it because I felt that WordPress and Mastodon were two sides of the same important coin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you know, I've felt as a writer that we've been tragically limited by the idea that Twitter popularized that there was glory in removing features that writers could use. As if to say that writers were over-using things like links, simple styling, titles, the ability to edit, or to finish a thought. These were all very basic features of writing on the web before 2006, as they should have been. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Somehow a mass psychosis took over and there was a belief that these limits were good. I am shaking my head as I write this. It's as ridiculous an idea as the one that's going around at the top levels of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-discuss-ending-childhood-vaccination-programs-with-rfk-jr-2024-12-12/&quot;&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.9RTQ.LzniX-N7b4Jd&amp;smid=bs-share&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; that we should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio&quot;&gt;bring polio back&lt;/a&gt; to the children of America and the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by supporting Mastodon, I hoped people would make the link between WordPress, which has none of those limits, yet is very popular for publishing on the web, and Mastodon, which I (it turns out correctly) believed would navigate away from those limits given enough time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I sent an email or a text message to Matt, or wrote a note on their Slack system, communicating with Matt is an iffy thing, not sure if the idea got through. Then this morning, I woke in the middle of the night, and realized that what I wished for was actually there. Without any fanfare at all. I could write on WordPress and it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113644817289884129&quot;&gt;appear on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. How is that not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what I asked for? And theoretically at least (someone should test this) you can access my WordPress writing on Threads, the system that Facebook launched to (as it turns out) compete with Bluesky! (In addition to Twitter, which is no longer called Twitter of course.) What a strange world it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And in the interim, the focus has gone off the social web, imho because the limits are still very much in force at Bluesky, which still insists a post can only have 300 freaking characters and no links, styles etc blah blah blah and yadda yadda. &lt;i&gt;We're still having this argument. &lt;/i&gt;Programmers vs writers. The world has lost its mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And in another thread there are idiots who propose trying to vilify and presumably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/a&gt; people &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/12/161258.html&quot;&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; drive Teslas as if the car you use for transport is as trivial a possession as a fur coat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm having a great day, no sarcasm, all of a sudden I feel like we might actually be winning, again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="There was a moment a couple of years ago when Mastodon was gaining traction in a serious way when I thought that Automattic should do something publicly to demonstrate support for it because I felt that WordPress and Mastodon were two sides of the same important coin." created="Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:18:50 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/13/161841.html#a161850"/>
				<source:outline text="As you know, I've felt as a writer that we've been tragically limited by the idea that Twitter popularized that there was glory in removing features that writers could use. As if to say that writers were over-using things like links, simple styling, titles, the ability to edit, or to finish a thought. These were all very basic features of writing on the web before 2006, as they should have been." created="Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:25:54 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/13/161841.html#a162554"/>
				<source:outline text="Somehow a mass psychosis took over and there was a belief that these limits were good. I am shaking my head as I write this. It's as ridiculous an idea as the one that's going around at the top levels of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-discuss-ending-childhood-vaccination-programs-with-rfk-jr-2024-12-12/&quot;&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.9RTQ.LzniX-N7b4Jd&amp;smid=bs-share&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; that we should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio&quot;&gt;bring polio back&lt;/a&gt; to the children of America and the world." created="Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:21:35 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/13/161841.html#a162135"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, by supporting Mastodon, I hoped people would make the link between WordPress, which has none of those limits, yet is very popular for publishing on the web, and Mastodon, which I (it turns out correctly) believed would navigate away from those limits given enough time." created="Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:21:44 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/13/161841.html#a162144"/>
				<source:outline text="I think I sent an email or a text message to Matt, or wrote a note on their Slack system, communicating with Matt is an iffy thing, not sure if the idea got through. Then this morning, I woke in the middle of the night, and realized that what I wished for was actually there. Without any fanfare at all. I could write on WordPress and it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113644817289884129&quot;&gt;appear on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. How is that not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what I asked for? And theoretically at least (someone should test this) you can access my WordPress writing on Threads, the system that Facebook launched to (as it turns out) compete with Bluesky! (In addition to Twitter, which is no longer called Twitter of course.) What a strange world it is." created="Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:22:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/13/161841.html#a162200"/>
				<source:outline text="And in the interim, the focus has gone off the social web, imho because the limits are still very much in force at Bluesky, which still insists a post can only have 300 freaking characters and no links, styles etc blah blah blah and yadda yadda. &lt;i&gt;We're still having this argument. &lt;/i&gt;Programmers vs writers. The world has lost its mind." created="Fri, 13 Dec 2024 16:23:11 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/13/161841.html#a162311"/>

			<description>BTW, I hear that Safari now defaults to using HTTPS. Not sure exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/johnspurlock.com/post/3ld5fpnbp7s2c&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; that means. But if they ever actually stop showing scripting.com, which will always be plain old HTTP, I'll probably ship an Electron product that browses the web, and doesn't care if it's HTTP or whatever new fad Google is promoting. I'm going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hold-the-fort&quot;&gt;hold the fort&lt;/a&gt; for the original web. I can't change scripting.com to HTTPS, it would break all the images and probably a lot of other stuff.</description>
