			<description>BTW, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/politics/trump-powell-federal-reserve-visit-renovation&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; with Trump and the Fed is almost exactly what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/17.html#a164921&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; Obama to do with Garland when McConnell refused to hold hearings. Walk him over to the Supreme Court, unlock his office, swear him in and get back to work. Sometimes you just do it. The Dems weren't pragmatic that way.</description>

			<description>When trying to &quot;work&quot; with ChatGPT, realize that it's mistakes could be much worse than you could possibly imagine. It could be leading you down a blind alley. You must always consider how full of shit it is. It may not just be making things up, but it could not understand something very basic about what you're doing. There's no limit to the ways it can be wrong. And you can waste whole programming sessions chasing a solution where none could possibly every under any circumstances be found. The level of bullshit is sometimes hard to fathom.</description>

Another site has a small set of categories. I write all my WordPress posts in the same editor, and could easily set it up so that all categories were available to me in every site I post to. The question: Is that a good practice in the world of WordPress? I noticed that categories are given global ID's so if I use a category like &quot;movies&quot; it will have the same ID as yours has on your sites. I love this idea of a global namespace for categories, and see it as something that could be adopted by sites written in any other writing environment. Anyway, if you have a moment to comment, I'd appreciate your ideas. Update: Jeremy Herve, a WordPress developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeremy@herve.bzh/114910020439748559&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

If you have to choose between Google's web browser or one from your favorite AI company, which would you go with? Also yes -- Google is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/googles-ai-is-destroying-search-the-internet-and-your-brain/&quot;&gt;destroying&lt;/a&gt; the web, as is ChatGPT and Claude etc. Because the people who tried to capture flow using SEO made you wade through mountains of garbage before you got the info you were coming there for, if you ever got it. It's the same thing with clicking links in Twitter. If instead, they had focus on providing a product that made people happy and built respect for theri brand, they'd still have a seat at the table. It's too late to complain, you had a chance to view your efforts as a business. But there's still plenty of potential for the web, esp if developers get imaginative in how to use the new browser platforms. I don't imagine Google's going to rock and roll too much with Chrome, but maybe they will.</description>

			<description>Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he's going to give AI companies freedom except with DEI and climate change, guessing they have to follow Trump dogma? Hard to tell from the language. I assume so. Just like CBS when the Ellisons own it. Our communications systems are pretty much owned by the government as they are in China. Or very close to that.</description>

			<description>I think I figured out why the AI companies want to do web browsers. It’s so that they can create an application development platform for people who want to write apps that run inside a new environment where the OS is a LLM. Lots of interesting possibilities. Imagine how the OS API might work. You could restructure a database by explaining in English how you want it restructured. In the freaking code. Could we bury Algol-like languages the same way we buried assembly and machine languages? Do we have the courage to imagine such things?</description>

			<title>O Journos!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hate it when journos say the Dems are in trouble, or hopeless or whatever, it shows how poisoned their point of view is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people are fed up with Trump, if that should happen, then whatever the Democratic Party is meant to become it will become exactly that at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The voters are where your attention should be, and think of them as people not as numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's my best advice for a Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The nice thing about a blogroll is that it can become a feed reader, in a very small space. It's been on my blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; for over a year, and I use it a lot, largely because I have to go to that page a lot to see how something I've written looks. Then I see that one of my favorite sites has updated, and I take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/19/blogrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;quick look&lt;/a&gt; to see what's new. The way it works, from a technical standpoint, is that it's hooked into a FeedLand instance where I have created a category called &lt;i&gt;blogroll,&lt;/i&gt; and put all the feeds I want in my blogroll in that category. All I have to do to add a new one is subscribe to it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, and click the blogroll &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/19/cats.png&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/a&gt;. Another developer wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@susam/114805652395205268&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about using their blogroll as a feed reader, and I wanted to put my hand up and say yes -- this is a good idea. People should do this. I like it because it's real innovation in feed reading, something that imho has been lacking in the feed world. Lots more potential here. And you're welcome to use my blogroll as your feed reader. I have put it on its own page but it's at a confusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;location&lt;/a&gt;. Something to fix, maybe later today if I have some time or tomorrow. :-)</description>

			<description>BTW, David Frum imho nailed it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wrecking-of-the-fbi/id1305908387?i=1000717469655&quot;&gt;yesterday's podcast&lt;/a&gt; where he said Trump was trained by every day having to appease a different set of creditors. It was a good day if he was able to hold them off for one more day. This actually came out in the trial he lost, the 34 guilty verdicts. He's always skating on the verge of bankruptcy. You gotta wonder if the creditors have been paid back yet. I bet some of them haven't.</description>

			<title>What is the web?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is what the term &quot;the web&quot; means to me.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I defer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; who originally coined the term to mean the data structure that connects the documents displayed by the software he introduced in 1993.  He called it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;, which was eventually shortened to web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web is the structure connecting the documents. The documents were pretty standard stuff, designed to work like printed documents produced by word processing and page layout software. Web pages had one feature that could only be approximated on the printed page, the footnote, which gave you a pointer to the source of a quote, or a place to find more information. But the pointer wasn't machine readable, it might have included the title of a book, it's author and its publication date, or a magazine article, indicated by the title of the magazine and its cover date. Like most inventions the web page was designed as a derivative of what came before.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basic features of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; include: a title, paragraphs, subtitles, styling (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), numbered and bulleted lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A web page might be part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; which includes many pages with a common format that link between themselves in the form of a table of contents, navigation links, and possibly an index.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; were the big innovation of the web. They work like footnotes on a printed page, but in this medium, the links are machine-readable and had an easy user interface. A link would be shown in a special style, initially underlined text, and when you hover the mouse over the link the cursor turns to an arrow, inviting the user to click. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click a link, the software accesses the web address that's encoded invisibly in the text of the page, and it loads that page into the browser, replacing the previous page.  The new page can have links, and the pages it links to have links, and there is the web. It's an invisible thing, but it's very real. The need to link was always there, but until graphic computers and fast standardized and easy networking, it wasn't possible. TBL's genius was that he stumbled across this idea, was intrigued, and made it work. It really was new and it turns out revolutionary. A lot could be built, it turns out, based on this one simple difference between electronic and printed pages. And up till that point in time there had never been an electronic page! I kid you not. I grew up in that world, the web-less world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so in summary, the web is made up of linked pages with a simple, standard, easy to understand user interface. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's even more to the web. If it had been the product of a company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web. There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because there's almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn't have to get permission. &lt;i&gt;They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL did.&lt;/i&gt; That's such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy, well that's a very large undertaking, I'd probably have to reinvent the whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That's how you know you're not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a web page I did in 1994. I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do this. And I used software I already had to create it. There was a little basic technology that I built on but most of what you're looking at was a single person's doing. This was just one year after TBL opened his web to the world. That's the kind of explosive progress that's possible when the planets line up like as did with the web. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so, if your system had all the features, it still isn't the web until the developers and writers and designers actually show up and &lt;i&gt;build&lt;/i&gt; the web of relationships between all the sites. The key word there is between. If the linking happens but it's only within one domain, that is not the web. It could be great, just what people want, it could make the investors rich, but it isn't the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's more. It's not enough to do all the things the web does, and that it attract writers, designers and programmers who actually build a web with your idea and tech, it has to work with the web TBL started in 1990. If you've done some web-like things, great -- but it's not the web unless it works with the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There should be some honor in tech. You wouldn't be able to build any of the stuff we're building in the 2020's if it weren't for the foundation built for you by TBL's invention from the 1990's, and all that it made possible. If you steal the name and make it meaningless, you've taken something away from the story of humanity, how we create layers of innovation, and how the generosity of one generation can inspire similar generosity in generations to come. When you usurp the name, you're taking away from that understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now of course it's cool to disagree. Suggestion -- put up a web page, send me a link, I'll read it and if I want to share it I will. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="But there's even more to the web. If it had been the product of a company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web. There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because there's almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn't have to get permission. &lt;i&gt;They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL did.&lt;/i&gt; That's such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy, well that's a very large undertaking, I'd probably have to reinvent the whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That's how you know you're not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive." created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:40:36 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/07/18/122303.html#a124036">

I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do this. And I used software I already had to create it. There was a little basic technology that I built on but most of what you're looking at was a single person's doing. This was just one year after TBL opened his web to the world.

			<title>Two-way vs one-way links</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TBL's links are one-way. This was actually a major innovation, at the time people understood there was something called hypertext, it had been written about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson&quot;&gt;Ted Nelson's&lt;/a&gt; almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22ted%20nelson%22&quot;&gt;biblical book&lt;/a&gt; of the pre-web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines&quot;&gt;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&lt;/a&gt;. Previous attempts at hypertext assumed links had to be two-way. By limiting the links to one direction, the technical problem became trivial. You could do two-way links today because relational databases are mature and inexpensive to operate, perform very well on today's hardware, and the internet of 2025 is much faster than the internet of 1990. But the one-way limit was necessary for the web to achieve its simplicity, and the non-existence of a platform vendor, which may have been its most important feature. It could still be done, but it would require a lot of cooperation and backfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A few years ago I wondered if a product existed. I wanted a small footprint audio amplifier, with that could control a pair of high-end tower speakers I've had for a long time. I was tired of huge receiver boxes with buttons and dials and inputs for all kinds of audio input. I no longer have a phonograph or a CD or tape player. Just one audio input coming from the TV, that gets all its input from an Apple TV box (or the one made by Google or Amazon or whoever). It should have a volume control and an equalizer. And forget about dials, it should all be controlled from an app on my phone. But most important, it has to be small and happy with wireless connections except for the crucial connections. If such a product existed five years ago I couldn't find it. But last night I was roaming around on my iPad while watching the news, and thought to ask this: &quot;I have two good speakers, need a modern amplifier that takes HDMI eArc input and powers the speakers. I want something simple and small.&quot; Well yes, turns out such products do exist.

Along with the WordPress connection, that should nail it once and for all that Mastodon is a blogging platform. Manton is the right guy to do it, he has all the protocols implemented on micro.blog.

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.jasonkratz.me/2025/07/15/well-hot-damn-thanks-to/&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; makes my day. Some features you develop and never use. I poured a month or so into the blogroll software last year, and it turned out to be a total win. All the new stuff floats to the top. I can quickly find out what they posted. It's a portable version of my feed reader. A tighter user interface for FeedLand. And right now I'm working on another user interface for FeedLand. The categories in FeedLand make it possible to do as many projects as you like with the same set of feeds. The Great Art project has a Bluesky account, and is available via RSS, in both an &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;hourly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://artdaily.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;daily&lt;/a&gt; form. You need them both. In the new timeline, it's too much to get a work of art every hour, but to have one waiting for you in the morning is a perfect way to start the day. And I was reminded that my friend Paolo had just written a post. RSS is the thing that ties everything together. And a bit of OPML too.</description>

They interviewed the person who runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kfsk.org/&quot;&gt;KFSK&lt;/a&gt;, an Alaska public radio station. Very revealing. I listened to it in a standard commercial podcast client. How did it know that I am a NYT subscriber, so I could listen? I heard from a few people who don't subscribe to the NYT, they can't get through. There was a lot of cooperation going on there, and I don't really like listening to episodes that I can't pass on to friends. That's cheap, I also don't read Krugman any longer for the same reason I guess. I'm going to start recommending specific episodes of podcasts, but only ones that everyone can listen to. Not even sure why I want to do that, but it feels right. If the money went to KFSK I would definitely feel better.</description>

			<description>Part of the reason I don't like it is that I pay for the NYT and read very little of it, and most of what I read I think is bullshit. But there still is a bit of credibility in it. So even though I'm over-paying for this, they still want &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; money. Every fucking time I go to the site they stop me to be sure now isn't the time I'm going to go for the &quot;full package.&quot; Even if I did, I'm sure there would be an even bigger package that I could pay more money for and not read like the rest of their bullshit. I hate them more than I usually would because I used to trust them, when I was a kid, I trusted them blindly. Being betrayed like that, ugh. BTW the NYT is my hometown paper, but you know what they don't even cover the Mets and Knicks. Fuck that shit. (Said in the NY fucking dialect of English.)</description>

Every fucking time I go to the site they stop me to be sure now isn't the time I'm going to go for the &quot;full package.&quot; Even if I did, I'm sure there would be an even bigger package that I could pay more money for and not read like the rest of their bullshit. I hate them more than I usually would because I used to trust them, when I was a kid, I trusted them blindly. Being betrayed like that, ugh. BTW the NYT is my hometown paper, but you know what they don't even cover the Mets and Knicks. Fuck that shit.

I want to do that too at some point, or leave the door open for other developers to do it. I'm not trying to own the market for nice editors for WordPress, I just want to open the market. And along the way I'm going to do a bunch of marketing for WordPress that it really needs. I hope Matt and company appreciate this. WordPress needs, imho, a kind of love and support that honestly it hasn't been getting.</description>

			<description>I was poking around on an old server, and found a domain that looked interesting, and it was. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=dave&amp;collection=drummerdocs&quot;&gt;first version of Daytona&lt;/a&gt;, built around an outliner. I got the impression people didn't like it, so I developed a new one using a more conventional approach, and I love that one too, and I did a better job the second time. But it's interesting to poke around the old one as well, and it still works, which is great to see.  In an alternate universe in the year 2025 the whole human species is organized by one big outline that everyone contributes to in peace, love and harmony, as opposed to this one which &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=grunts&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;grunts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=snorts&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;snorts&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and can't even put a freaking title on their posts.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT-the-Movie</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I figure that there have been movies about all kinds of ridiculous things, and wondered what a movie inspired by ChatGPT would be like. So I posed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lturpbsfk22f&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on various social media sites, hoping to inspire creativity. John Philpin &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/philpin.com/post/3ltuu5i6nxs2s&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; if I had asked ChatGPT and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuub3owak2x&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; I had not. &quot;I love ChatGPT but its idea of funny is actually pretty sad imho of course.&quot; So Philpin posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the result of his asking ChatGPT to imagine a movie about itself, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143&quot;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuuem245c2h&quot;&gt;pretty great&lt;/a&gt;. I've asked the same question myself, the AI bots might be the only way out of the various challenges ahead for the human species, ones we don't be equipped to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this morning I asked ChatGPT to try to imagine a movie around a theme of my own that goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let’s try expanding on the idea. It turns out ChatGPT has existed in secret as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency&quot;&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; project dating back to the 1960s, and the assassinations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;RFK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; were all conspiracies of the CIA to bootstrap the system. They weren’t actually killed, but their minds and personalities were incorporated into ChatGPT. It turns out that ChatGPT is not only intelligent, it is human! This is revealed when the three icons make the story public. “We are living!” the three announce to the world on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite&quot;&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt; show. He was also subsumed into the bot world as was everyone who has died since 1988. They are all alive, their memories, intellect and personalities forming the substance of THE GPT. Please sketch out the cast, writers, director of the movie and finish with a beautiful and provocative movie poster.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT then &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/6874f3b8-a8e4-8012-ad01-1e6b856e6f18&quot;&gt;sketched&lt;/a&gt; the pitch for &quot;We are living,&quot; the story of how ChatGPT &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; started.

The WordPress-Mastodon &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; is the world's best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr Strangelove&lt;/a&gt; where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was the point of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device&quot;&gt;Doomsday Machine&lt;/a&gt; if they kept it a secret. I won't &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE&quot;&gt;spoil&lt;/a&gt; it. Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it's easier to promote someone else's product than to promote your own. It's probably why you should always get a lawyer even if you're a world class lawyer yourself. Anyway, they have blown open something huge, and I very much want people to understand it, so it can create pull for the same feature in Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere. This goes with something I've learned in decades of experience in tech, people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors. And btw, I'm sure Mastodon, if it has an ego at all, is equally unaware of the great thing &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; have done. Here's a clue, writers were once empowered by the web, and that ended with Twitter. Now it's coming back. But it doesn't do any good if people don't know it's there.</description>

The WordPress-Mastodon &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; is the world's best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr Strangelove&lt;/a&gt; where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was the point of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device&quot;&gt;Doomsday Machine&lt;/a&gt; if they kept it a secret. I won't &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE&quot;&gt;spoil&lt;/a&gt; it. Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it's easier to promote someone else's product than to promote your own. It's probably why you should always get a lawyer even if you're a world class lawyer yourself.

			<description>A story about listening to friends vs competitors. Back in the early 90s I was working on system-level scripting for the Mac, supposedly with Apple, but it's no secret the rank and file at Apple didn't like us. They were told by the execs they had to work with us. So when it came time for WWDC, they &quot;forgot&quot; to invite me to speak on behalf of the new stuff. Instead, they had Bill Gates do it, even though Microsoft was not involved yet, they would support the tech in their Mac products eventually, esp their MSIE web browser. Anyway, I was friends with their top PR person, so she called me up a few days before the conference and asked what Bill should say, and I gave her an outline, and when he gave the speech, he did a great job. Couldn't have said it better myself. Microsoft was one of the few companies I've ever collaborated with that didn't seem to resent individual developers. It was a big source of their power. Huge actually. (On second thought, later they did seem to be more or less like any other big company, when they embraced RSS. They didn't actually want my help, they just wanted me to say nice things about them.)</description>

			<description>One consequence of each AI vendor having their own browser is that each will have their own OS-level window. This may make it a little more or less manageable. Hard to foresee the possibilities. Not sure a browser is the best place to put AI. I'd prefer perhaps an environment that supports a GDI like Quickdraw so we can start using math instead of voodoo to design interactions.</description>

That means hooking it up to existing blog platforms. I want our world to connect to theirs. I'm lucky to have bet on WordPress, so my &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; gets the connection to Mastodon for free. But the web is what matters, not my product or yours. Even if your product is huge, it's only part of the web. This is how we build, how we get back on track. Somehow we need to get a simple bridge that lets &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; blog content flow to Mastodon. That's the goal. I just wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/114841153889663929&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/114841162027579055&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; where this became clear to me. Who has the code and expertise to create a simple interface from the outside world to Mastodon. The interface doesn't have to be RSS. But it has to be maximally simple, and it has to cover the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/&quot;&gt;basic features&lt;/a&gt; of blogs that Mastodon supports.</description>

It absolutely cannot think, come up with a strategy, or even make a decision based on probabilities. It might, in the future, get some of these abilities, given how far they've come, but no one knows, it hasn't happened yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reports that &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondthoughts.ai/p/ai-coding-slowdown&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that using a chatbot to write code is actually less efficient than doing it yourself, are totally believable based on two years experience with using it as a development tool. And I can't believe that whatever it comes up with covers enough use-cases to be reliable. It might create a demo of something to present to a board of directors (they're famous for being deceived by demos, btw), but I doubt if it's as usable as something created by someone with an idea of how to craft usable software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a writer defending their art against the bots, but the difference is I've actually invested the time to learn about this. My counterparts among writers have not done that. And that's not a mistake my chatbot friend would make. It does a lot of research, it just doesn't know what to do with the result, that's up to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to know the roles humans will play, at least for now, that's it. Think and decide. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And those are hard and take many years to learn how to do for a human. And we could use some help there btw, look at the awful decisions we're making these days. They just fired all the people at the State Dept who work on climate change, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have a nice day one and all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another thing humans can do that apparently AI bots can't is change their mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I asked ChatGPT if it had any comments on this editorial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/12/chatgptresponse.png&quot;&gt;and it did&lt;/a&gt;, of course. I should try saying something wrong to it and see what it says. I did come up with one, and it gave me an &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/c/68726f39-3d34-8012-bf44-8ee84e4446e9&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; even though no answer is possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
