It's from June 14, 2004. It's 1/2 of a panel in 1991 that I was on with Bill Gates. This is before the turn to the web. At this point I'm starting to look around for audio that might fit into this new audio blog channel that goes with my written blog.</description>

			<description>Technical note. I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/datesoff.png&quot;&gt;mistake&lt;/a&gt; in converting local time to GMT in the code that builds the feed. My times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are now six. I bet all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the creation date of the item, and they changed. Oh well. At least the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS version&lt;/a&gt; only has three items. I think I should change how the guid works.</description>

			<title>The FeedLand stack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over at any level, you can, and today I'm doing exactly that. But first here's the stack:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the lowest level is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple package&lt;/a&gt;, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the source &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/a&gt; are included, where they are present.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Above that level is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase&quot;&gt;feedlanddatabase package&lt;/a&gt;, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds, subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I'm going to start building today.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Next level up is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland&quot;&gt;feedland package&lt;/a&gt;, which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff that the FeedLand client needs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST interface happens here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; I'm working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that's already there. The advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage the data structures. So that's what I'm doing. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The next patriotic kitten</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that the music industry had concocted. They didn't give a shit about the users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users. We supposedly didn't have any. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman&quot;&gt;Emmett Chapman&lt;/a&gt;, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick&quot;&gt;musicial instrument&lt;/a&gt; for himself and others to use. That's what I do with software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there's been plenty of time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out. For that he would say Every day is Father's Day. That may be my greatest accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought (and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our uncle Ken, on my mother's side, and said he would have shit his pants over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine. The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I'm absolutely sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my great uncle &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno&lt;/a&gt; who was a pioneer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;zettlekasten&lt;/a&gt; would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a shorter name). People's first reaction is that by creating art with ChatGPT I'm stealing. Bollocks. I'm creating. I'm not even going to validate that with a rebuttal. I am proving it with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patriotic+Kitten%22&quot;&gt;Patriotic Kitten&lt;/a&gt; thread, the next of which I will now entertain you with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/patrioticKitten2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The second patriotic kitten. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a quick look indicates that it's a fairly large project. All I want to do is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There's no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I'm going to have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>For people who use &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. If you accidentally close a file that's open and want it to re-appear in its previous position, you can edit your prefs.json file. You can find it by choosing &lt;i&gt;Open Data Folder&lt;/i&gt; from the File menu. You'll see prefs.json. Open it in a text editor, and make the changes you want -- carefully. Probably a good idea to make a copy of the file before editing. But I just did it and laughed out loud, why didn't I think of this before? Heh.</description>

			<title>Twenty years ago today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM&quot;&gt;June 11, 2004&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me, it's June &lt;i&gt;2024&lt;/i&gt; now, it's been &lt;i&gt;twenty freaking years&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and it's still as open as it was back in June 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast&lt;/b&gt;. That was the goal. You don't need anyone's permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less real and less interesting, imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My partner in this at the time was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry&quot;&gt;Adam Curry&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime in that period he started &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code&quot;&gt;The Daily Source Code&lt;/a&gt;, and then we did a podcast together for a few months called &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. My own podcast was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months, with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows. I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew, Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine won't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the URL for the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck. I'll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I'll register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that's still thriving twenty years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should be quite a story! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004. And that's the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in Seattle at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/gnomedexDaveAdam.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Dave and Adam at Gnomedex in 2004.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The creativity of ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the creativity of ChatGPT, some call it hallucinations, but maybe all the rest of this stuff is hallucinating, maybe only ChatGPT sees what's real? Could be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the prompt: &quot;PODCAST0 from Dave Winer with occasional appearances by Adam Curry, all original 2004 podcasts, the very first podcasts in the galaxy, and possibly the universe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/allthepodcasts.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;All the original 2004 podcasts. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When I started the project, I had no idea what I'd find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don't know the extent of it, but there's a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I'm thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I'm beginning to see the utility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; as a feed operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It's not just a feed reader. It's able to do things most feed readers don't do, maybe none do. We don't have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either. I will of course share the results when they are shareable.</description>

			<description>Three movies I've watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The Matrix. 3. The Devil's Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they go together. And they're all about the same thing, about choosing to live in a dream, or to live the life you're actually living. All three are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to end, which is really unusual for me these days.</description>

			<title>Imagine RSS as a cover story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; has never been on the cover of a magazine, so you can't say ChatGPT is stealing this from anyone. In fact I'm offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press has chosen to focus on the idea that it's plagiarizing journalists. The ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they're doing their jobs, they're reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series&quot;&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt;. I don't owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I read the news on their site. The news doesn't belong to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn't so far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no billionaires involved, so they didn't consider it newsworthy I guess. Some day we're going to have to accept that we have to make our own news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker's famous line -- &quot;If you don't like the news go out and make some of your own.&quot; So here we go. I asked ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/16/imagineTheyPutRSSOnACover.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Imagine RSS as the cover story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read printed magazines?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

He asked a whole bunch of things but stopped short of asking the question that would have nailed him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mr Durst, would you kill someone to avoid being convicted of killing your wife?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From what we know of Durst he would have had a hard time saying no. When he's caught he generally admits he's caught. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They got the conviction anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I don't recommend either season but having watched the first, I was kind of committed to watching the second.

			<title>A great political ad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay it's not the best political ad ever but it's pretty freaking good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We love America and the flag stands for the good in us, in all of us. And our president not only gets that, he is doing what presidents are supposed to do, unite us. To the extent that we can at this time be united. But even a MAGA, viewing this ad, is going to have to swell up with pride for what this country means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VC2SshZ373M?si=CV1-O9liPDmIhQRN&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I have a question for my campaign friend and politics rabbi -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/that-trippi-show/id1523896927&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. Joe, why don't they ask for a contribution at the end? I'd pay money specifically to have that ad run everywhere, even in states we have no chance of winning. Because there are people in every state that deserve encouragement, and if we want to really win we need them to feel part of our great country as much as anyone in a swing state. And there's always value in forcing the opposition to campaign in states they otherwise feel are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So let me -- a regular citizen -- earmark a contribution for &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; message. It gives me another way to vote, a sense I'm participating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Joe, why don't they ask for a contribution at the end? I'd pay money specifically to have that ad run everywhere, even in states we have no chance of winning. Because there are people in every state that deserve encouragement, and if we want to really win we need them to feel part of our great country as much as anyone in a swing state. And there's always value in forcing the opposition to campaign in states they otherwise feel are safe." created="Fri, 14 Jun 2024 17:53:56 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/06/14/175200.html#a175356"/>

It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription lists&lt;/a&gt; back in the 00s that it included the &lt;i&gt;htmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute, it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I'm using a SQL database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I thought &quot;no big deal&quot; it's a variant of a SQL table I've now done a dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I've yet to come up with a way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at runtime. That's how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be factored. This probably doesn't make sense to too many people, maybe it won't even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I've moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I'm sure it's possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of them, which is why I'm taking my break from &lt;i&gt;The Next Product&lt;/i&gt; to do this.</description>

			<description>It's not much of a secret that my next product is the minimal writing tool I always felt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; should have. I have not been doing this in conjunction with Automattic, I'm not sure we're on the same planet re what WordPress is for. Ultimately it'll be their decision if this idea gains traction. But I keep hearing people ask for this product, and I think it's the reason Substack and Ghost have become popular. I'm going to put it out there, and see what comes back. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, I love the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot;&gt;margin image&lt;/a&gt; of NakedJen. Talking with her the other day we decided this would be the opening scene of The NakedJen Movie. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xqiu0ekahw&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt; of the image is well-known to people who travel with the Dead, as Jen did. I've never been to a Dead concert with her, but I understand it's like going to a Comdex or MacWorld in the 80s or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricklin.com/albums/pcforum99/&quot;&gt;Esther's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/digerati/alsop/&quot;&gt;Stewart's&lt;/a&gt; conferences for me in the 90s. Sure you go for the music, but &lt;i&gt;mainly&lt;/i&gt; you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;schmooze&lt;/a&gt; in the hallways. I love talking with her on the phone the most. We have thought about doing a podcast, and even tried recording one, but our one-to-one conversations are much more interesting, and funny. We're take turns being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain&quot;&gt;Pinky or the Brain&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Why Google should know my blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did a search on my site for NakedJen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google thinks I meant &quot;Naked Men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why Google should know I have a blog and it has it indexed, and if it just looks it would know that question shows how &lt;b&gt;dumb&lt;/b&gt; it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I type my mother's name in, searching on my own blog (again) it tries to correct the spelling of her name. My own mother's name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google started out so smart then they must have lost all the smart people. Or they got stupid? I don't know. But there's so much they could do to improve their product, it would be sensible to, while they're shooting for the fences, do the small things that would give users an idea that there's &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; humanity to the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/13/nakedJenOrNakedMen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;NakedJen or &quot;Naked Men.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: ChatGPT should also know where my blog is, and it should be constantly loading the updates. This is the freaking breakthrough. Do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I have no clue how he saw the patterns.

			<description>Someone should tell the kids the Repubs will come for their weed. Just sayin. There probably are a number of voting age youngsters who have never lived in a time and place when cannabis was illegal.</description>

			<description>By popular demand -- my blogroll now makes it more clear that the permalink to each item is the date of the item. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/blogrollScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. This is a convention in blogs and social media apps that the timestamp doubles as a permalink. And I think this is more distracting, and cluttered, but let's give it a try. It's possible that people missed that they could go to the website from the blogroll. Now it should be more obvious.</description>

Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It's the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything. They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage on. They don't know how else to do it. It doesn't have much to do with inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It's deeper than that. We're all living a lie, that if we had money we'd be happy. The sad truth is no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don't believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the aftermath, and it wasn't pretty. “All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.” We're at the beginning of the &quot;happen again&quot; moment. My grandfather told me what to do, but I won't do it, pretty sure of that.</description>

I'd love to add more creative stuff here. And I'd love to get some of Stan Krute's genius or Brad Pettit or whoever else might be so inspired. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No promises about when or if they'd be used.
