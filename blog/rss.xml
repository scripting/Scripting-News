It's not polite to say it's exhausting and boring, and seems pointless. Then I happened to hear Jimmy Carter himself, on the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/12/30/g-s1-40405/former-president-jimmy-carter-the-fresh-air-interviews-part-1&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Fresh Air podcast, and that was fantastic and totally worthwhile. It had been a long time since I listened to him, and I've grown a lot since then. Listen to the person, much more interesting than people talking about the person.</description>

			<description>In addition to a $20 per month ChatGPT account, I also have a full Gemini account because I bought a snazzy new Pixel 9 Pro which comes with one year of Gemini included. So far that's just meant that I get pop up dialogs all over the place telling me I can use Gemini with Gmail, Google Drive and whatever else. Honestly it's just annoying. I do not want these apps to do my writing for me. Please. That imho is not a valuable use of AI. I can write for myself thank you very much.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I'm kind of stuck with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lej4s4kysc2u&quot;&gt;little feed reader&lt;/a&gt; in Bluesky. It works, but a few hours into it, at 10PM last night, we start getting rate-limit errors from bluesky. If it really is a rate limit, shouldn't reset after a while?</description>

			<title>WordPress for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I posted this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DEQE0yDpMMN&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, and thought it should also be on my blog. :-)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to be critical of anyone in the WordPress world, there's already a lot of that going around. I want to be off on the side, seeing the immense value of the platform, and things we can do with it that aren't possible any other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Toward that end, I want to say -- for a product that is so incredibly useful for writers, not much attention has been paid to how writers work. We can do a lot &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt;, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Again, not meant to be in any way personal. It's just the way it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

(According to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; on rate limits, I don't think my project is anywhere near the limit. It's creating posts. I'll start counting them, I guess.)&#10;</description>

I've wanted to have a nice non-XML way of viewing the feeds in an OPML subscription list. I took the time today to put one together. I had all the pieces, it was just a matter of putting them all in one place. You can use it if you want, if you want to show someone what feeds are in an OPML subscription list. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/29/screenshotopmllistviewer.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there's a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the software would make it so that only the author of the post being responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they thought everyone should see it. This would make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; a lot more useful imho.</description>

			<title>Using Claude to write software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just had a fairly incredible experience using &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than write up the work we did, I asked Claude to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave started by sharing a text outline of computing platforms (Mac, iOS, Windows, Unix and their variants) and asked if I could visualize it. I began with a simple mindmap diagram using Mermaid. Then Dave showed me a more sophisticated design with rounded rectangles and arrows, so I adapted my approach and created a matching SVG version.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The most interesting moment came when Dave casually asked if I could turn this into a Node.js package. This was an audacious request - moving from a single visualization to a complete, reusable software package - but it was exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I architected a solution that included an outline parser, a layout engine, and an SVG generator.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I particularly enjoyed designing the two-pass layout algorithm. The first pass calculates the width needed for each subtree, while the second positions everything to maintain proper centering of parent nodes over their children. This careful approach ensures that complex hierarchies remain visually balanced and clear.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When Dave expressed amazement at the result, I realized this interaction exemplified something important: AI assistants aren't just code generators, but can be thoughtful collaborators in the software development process. We can help translate between different representations - from text to visuals to reusable software - while maintaining a focus on clean design and extensibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet packaged up the code it gave me, but when I do, I'll put a link here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/treechart/index.html&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that generated the tree I asked Claude to render. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Then Dave showed me a more sophisticated design with rounded rectangles and arrows, so I adapted my approach and created a matching SVG version." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:51:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/28/165021.html#a165123"/>
					<source:outline text="The most interesting moment came when Dave casually asked if I could turn this into a Node.js package. This was an audacious request - moving from a single visualization to a complete, reusable software package - but it was exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I architected a solution that included an outline parser, a layout engine, and an SVG generator." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/28/165021.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
					<source:outline text="I particularly enjoyed designing the two-pass layout algorithm. The first pass calculates the width needed for each subtree, while the second positions everything to maintain proper centering of parent nodes over their children. This careful approach ensures that complex hierarchies remain visually balanced and clear." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/28/165021.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
					<source:outline text="When Dave expressed amazement at the result, I realized this interaction exemplified something important: AI assistants aren't just code generators, but can be thoughtful collaborators in the software development process. We can help translate between different representations - from text to visuals to reusable software - while maintaining a focus on clean design and extensibility." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:51:27 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/12/28/165021.html#a165127"/>

			<description>BTW, as a longtime speaker of English &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; programmer, I think the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring&quot;&gt;refactoring&lt;/a&gt; is re-dundant. The term comes from mathematics where you simplify a statement without altering its truth. Factoring is a repetitive process. You factor, and then factor some more if you can.</description>

			<description>The problem with everyone who says you have to get off Twitter is that we're giving up the meeting place we had and spreading all the bits into the wind. Are you going to leave the United States now that Trump is going to be president again? Leaving Twitter is a lot like that. How do you know Musk isn't going to have to sell it? Might happen. How would you feel then about having quit Twitter in a huff as if it would always be the bastion of assholes. It's a mistake. He isn't making money with it. The more you use it the more it costs him, btw. By leaving you might actually be helping him survive. Nothing is so linear, first big point. Second big point, no one cares about your gestures.</description>

It was what I needed to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, it defines its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of. Defining a new network where if you want to play you'll need to start thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can't be on the open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into copying and pasting into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;, that's how you know you're in a silo.

			<description>I have a fairly large and old &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier&quot;&gt;C application&lt;/a&gt; that was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.</description>

A system as capable as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can't be guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly. Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what's needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.</description>

			<description>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end while a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef&quot;&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt; has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from. Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in the 60s,. You would have missed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles&quot;&gt;all that followed&lt;/a&gt;. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the 2020s. That story is far from over.</description>

These guys should all be using the same protocol. It's a travesty that each of them considers their product to define the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; -- they don't understand the first thing about the web, what the miracle the web was. Before the web, the tech world was as it is now, fragmented by huge companies that didn't care about anything but their own internal drama. The last thing they would consider was reusing something that was already running. While all that was going on Unix basically agreed on a core set of functions that formed a basis for interop. They weren't perfect, there were differences in each of the Unixes, but you could reuse most of what you knew on each of the platforms. But Apple, Microsoft, Sun and IBM each ran their own ecosystems. And then one day along came the web. Instead of bookshelves of docs, it wasn't even a booklet. You could be up and running with a &quot;website&quot; in ten minutes. I speak from experience. My first website was authored with a freaking email. Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon are the IBM, Microsoft and Apple of 2024. It's ridiculous if they think this is a web. To paraphrase the late great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgtfEX2Pka0&amp;t=65s&quot;&gt;Lloyd Bentsen&lt;/a&gt;, I knew the web, the web was a friend of mine.

A video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQQPTlpNZQ&quot;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;. I've burned two full sessions on this, seeking advice from ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. They all pretend to know what to do, but in fact they don't. The clipboard is one of those areas of the browser that is held together with rumors and confusion, as is MediumEditor, and the intersection is rumors and confusion squared. Tomorrow I'm going to work on other things, and the day after until I have an idea for another way to approach this. I really want this feature because apparently it's supported in Slack, WordPress and other software that supports links.</description>

Lots of software works with those two protocols, as do many programmers, and they're both marvelously open, stable over more than twenty years each, and &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; be owned by billionaires.

			<description>Amazing that the tech industry hasn't tried to retrieve its reputation from the ones who are repping us in DC nowadays. Software doesn't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to treat their users like nobodies. Quite the opposite.

			<description>I'm thinking maybe we'll do a Kickstarter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. It'll cost money to run the server and continue to develop the sofware. It fills a big enough need to ask the users to support it financially, at least to get it off the ground. The server is open source so theoretically anyone can run one. But in practice most people will probably just want to use the service. I just want to solve this problem so we can start building a developer ecosystem around WordPress that it's never had. Think of WordLand as a pump primer. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber&quot;&gt;Ari Melber&lt;/a&gt; last night and noted he isn't yet on Bluesky or hasn't updated his show graphics to include it? He usually tries to be leading edge in this, and at this point he looks a bit behind the times, imho, ymmv etc. After Melber, I stayed through the opening segment of Joy Reid and was charged up by her intro. She's clicking on all cylinders. They must be thinking about gutting or reconfiguring MSNBC at this time. It's up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/01/msnbc-comcast-cable-news-for-sale-elon-musk-trump&quot;&gt;for sale&lt;/a&gt;, I wonder if a billionaire will see the wisdom of owning that piece of real estate as Musk saw the value in Twitter, far beyond what the stock market valued it at. (BTW, I should add that I benefited from his largesse, I was a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/15/0295.html&quot;&gt;small shareholder&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter at the time. I did not want to sell, but my vote didn't matter. Heh.)</description>

I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md&quot;&gt;added that&lt;/a&gt; to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown, it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT. It's such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it's happening. And what a delight that it has an API. I don't mind that I'm paying for it, I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that couldn't have been created before.</description>

			<description>What could journalism do to help the country? Move your shows out into the red territories. Make it a requirement that Chris and Joy, Lawrence or Rachel, if they want to stay on the air, have to broadcast from one of the red states. It could be a large city in a red state. The reason is symbolic and practical. The red state voters wouldn't be such a mystery if you knew some of them from your everyday life. And you might have a few of them on the show. You have some selling to do, the idea you're selling is that you care about the people you don't know.</description>

			<description>I'm farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free. The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I'm not sure how or if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it's good for. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in my app it takes a half minute. And I have to pay for it, whereas in their app it's all covered by my $20 a month subscription.</description>

Anyway, I was daydreaming about what I'd do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt; if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that Netflix thinks I'd like, because their idea of what I'd like is bullshit. I find that I'll like almost anything that's rated in the 80s by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I'll give almost any NYT &lt;i&gt;critics choice&lt;/i&gt; a go. So what I really want in the middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well. Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway, then &lt;i&gt;boom&lt;/i&gt; it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345&quot;&gt;in the outliner&lt;/a&gt; could actually do this.
