It got me going on various explorations. Wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/09/21/dave-learns-of-headless-wordpress/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on my WP site. It's actually easier for me to write posts on that site when all I have is my iPad. I do all my writing on Scripting News in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a desktop-only app. I'm going to start engaging in discussions about WordPress where the people are. Also starting to think about my keynote in Ottawa in October which is now less than a month away. A note to the people running the show, I would be open to having it be an interview instead of a speech. I have trouble staying anchored to the audience with slides, I don't really like that way of communicating. I prefer interview style, with an interviewer who is interested in the subject matter. I want to do at least a bit of a demo, talk about how we got here, the early blogosphere, all the things that led to WordPress, and the connection WordPress has now to social media systems like Mastodon. We must focus on that connection because so much has been accomplished there in the last year, and it hasn't imho gotten enough attention. I want to talk more about the big picture, how WordPress has a role to play that goes beyond serving ecommerce sites, which is, I understand where the money is. Money is good but right now imho our world wide public communication system desperately needs an upgrade. It's been crippled by decisions made by Twitter almost 20 years ago. I want to turn that around, put back &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;the features they took out&lt;/a&gt;, and to do that I need to start a network that's built on the web, not in silos that can't connect to each other. That is not the web I know, where everything can connect to anything. I don't think at this time any of the social media apps should be considered part of the web. I remember the magic of the web, we built the blogosphere around the web, and thus WordPress is also built around the web. For more perspective, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in August about thinking differently about WordPress. That's what I am the evangelist for, thinking about WordPress in a different, wider role, bringing the web to the people in a very usable way.</description>

			<description>Here's a thought for WordPress users and developers. WordPress is huge, but it's just part of the web. That's what it means to be on the web, my friends. Everything connects to anything on the web. Once we build out a social network from WordPress, all the other systems will have no choice but to hook up too. All this talk of AT Proto and ActivityPub being the connecting glue is nonsense. &lt;i&gt;The web is the connecting glue. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>In ways older people handle change better than younger ones, because we know change is here, every freaking day, and we know in a few years, at most, really big change is coming. So the attitude of the older person is often what the fuck, let's go. I'm not kidding. Maybe later in life I will get more conservative, it could happen.</description>

			<description>There should be a ChatGPT &quot;personality&quot; for the chatbot. I'd like to start with a black lab. When I say &quot;good work&quot; that reinforces that what it did should be a priority. If I say that and give it a treat (by typing &quot;treat&quot;) that should get double emphasis. I might like it better if I could train it. I don't mind a little enthusiasm, but I want it to respond to me with respect.</description>

			<title>Can we finally put the past behind us?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cross-posted from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/09/16/can-we-finally-put-the-past-behind-us/&quot;&gt;daveverse site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t considered the point of view of people who worked at Netscape when it disappeared just as RSS 0.9.1 was being adopted by the blogosphere in 1999. We tried to get in touch, even when they didn’t work there, but no one responded. So we kept going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we were surprised when a group of people we didn’t know announced, publicly, that they were the new authority on RSS and at the same time introduced a version 1.0 that was incompatible with the format Netscape left behind. Most developers didn’t switch, very few used their format. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were discussions and arguments and lots of hurt feelings on the mail list, but the status quo remained for a couple of years. There was RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0. Most sites used 0.91. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years, we got lucky and found the people at the NYT who could license their proprietary feeds to us to use in our Radio UserLand product. We did a deal with them, and we were allowed to bundle their feeds with Radio. At first we stayed with their proprietary format, wanting to avoid dragging them into the arguments. But then we heard from other pubs that wanted to follow the NYT, and they wanted to know what they should do. We had a new version in the works, 0.92, that had a few new features, but as this was in development, we realized were doing all the work, and 1.0 was just sitting there as an obstacle, it would always appear as what we were doing was less than what they did, when the two really had nothing to do with each other. Since they never consulted us about superceeding the format we were using, we changed 0.92 to 2.0, waited for the flames, but they never came. People were tired of the arguing and there was too much potential in a publishing surface that was shared by bloggers and professional news. So guess what -- RSS 2.0 became the standard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The ex-Netscapers never talked with us, even though their big company no longer existed. We might have worked out something if they had talked with us as equals. But I guess we weren't good enough for them? Hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don’t care if they claim they created RSS, I've never claimed to be the inventor, and I don't there's much value in that -- and frankly I think The NY Times had more to do with its success than any of us. If they hadn’t decided to jump in simply because they liked my little company, RSS would be nothing but a bunch of geeks arguing about who did what about something no one cared about. We might be reminiscing about what might have happened if we could only work with each other and considered each others’ perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To this day, decades later, they still won't talk to us. But I guess from their point of view we had no right to use the supposedly open format their defunct company had left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a different view of the web. It is not made of companies, it’s made of people. Companies can use the web, but they can’t own it. And I suggest that the people here no matter where they work now or in the past understand that there are other points of view. No matter how big your company is or was, you are still just people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have worked for big prestigious companies and organizations too. So what. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so you all sent me a message by taking something I created and was proud of and called it your own without saying where you got it. You can do that, and hopefully this is the end of the vendetta. You can feel you got the win you are entitled to. You caused the pain you were hoping to. So now can we finally put the past behind us? Imho we have much bigger problems to solve and that can only happen if people work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can agree that RSS has done a lot of good for a lot of people. It isn't perfect. But it deserves a little peace and quiet, that I actually thought it had achieved. From here-on, let's try to make it better, not take things out of it for our own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How about a virtual handshake and finally put the past behind us?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I hadn’t considered the point of view of people who worked at Netscape when it disappeared just as RSS 0.9.1 was being adopted by the blogosphere in 1999.

				<source:outline text="After a couple of years, we got lucky and found the people at the NYT who could license their proprietary feeds to us to use in our Radio UserLand product. We did a deal with them, and we were allowed to bundle their feeds with Radio. At first we stayed with their proprietary format, wanting to avoid dragging them into the arguments. But then we heard from other pubs that wanted to follow the NYT, and they wanted to know what they should do. We had a new version in the works, 0.92, that had a few new features, but as this was in development, we realized were doing all the work, and 1.0 was just sitting there as an obstacle, it would always appear as what we were doing was less than what they did, when the two really had nothing to do with each other. Since they never consulted us about superceeding the format we were using, we changed 0.92 to 2.0, waited for the flames, but they never came. People were tired of the arguing and there was too much potential in a publishing surface that was shared by bloggers and professional news. So guess what -- RSS 2.0 became the standard." created="Fri, 19 Sep 2025 20:23:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/09/19/201705.html#a202319"/>

				<source:outline text="I don’t care if they claim they created RSS, I've never claimed to be the inventor, and I don't there's much value in that -- and frankly I think The NY Times had more to do with its success than any of us. If they hadn’t decided to jump in simply because they liked my little company, RSS would be nothing but a bunch of geeks arguing about who did what about something no one cared about.

			<description>When Paramount said firing Colbert was financial, I think they were telling the truth. Unless they dumped Colbert the $8 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_of_Skydance_Media_and_Paramount_Global&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with the Ellisons wouldn't happen. So it was Colbert or $8 billion. They went for the money. Pretty sure it's the same thing with ABC and Kimmel.</description>

I was explaining how I wanted to see a whole market of editors. You could see them as &quot;For WordPress&quot; but there's another way to look at them. They're plug-in replacements for the dreaded &quot;tiny little textboxes&quot; we see in twitter-like systems. Those awful little things. We know so many ways to make better editors. Now imagine that we store your Mastodon posts in WordPress documents (we do). And you see how the pieces start to fit together. Think of WordPress as the command line of the social web. And it really will be the web, not a promise of someday maybe being the web. It's like a Wordle puzzle. You have to move the parts around until you see a picture develop. Another fun thing, WordPress has a great simple REST api that's been around since 2017, and it covers most of the product functionality and is debugged, scaled and stable. It probably is the simplest API for ActivityPub. Now does that blow your mind? This is how you know this is the web, because your mind keeps exploding once you realize the things you could do just by connecting two things together and it works because they interop. Matthias has been working on this stuff since 2008. Our paths didn't cross until earlier this year.</description>

(It's not me, most of my job re RSS has been fairly thankless and not creative, and definitely not profitable, but still worth doing because the web is the only place independent developers can work without the interference of big tech companies.)</description>

Most of the stories miss the real innovator, and when you find out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/martinLeavesTheTimes.html&quot;&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; it is you will be surprised. (It's not me, most of my job re RSS has been fairly thankless and not creative, and definitely not profitable, but still worth doing because the web is the only place independent developers can work without the interference of big tech companies.)" created="Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:12:51 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/17/reallySimpleKetchup.png" imageLink="https://ketchup.reallysimple.org/" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/09/17.html#a131251"/>

			<description>A bunch of new people are trying out FeedLand news products. I haven't looked at them in a long time. I'm glad they're looking, but most of my demo news products were broken. Oy. It was hard to untangle. It should be a lot easier, and next time I can dig in and do it over I think it will be. Anyway as I convert my demos, I'll list them here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mlbriver.com/&quot;&gt;mblriver.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://politics.newsriver.org/&quot;&gt;politics.newsriver.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggers.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;bloggers.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dave.podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;dave.podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Here's an idea. Why doesn't Apple make a laptop with a light shining out to highlight the user's face so they look better when they're on a Zoom call. I bet someone makes a device like this to clip on a laptop. Right??</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is great at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt;. Describe the icon you want and in a few iterations you have it, even if it's not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I would have killed to have this a few years ago, before FA came out. This is the best of both -- use FA if they have the right icon, design your own if they don't. It also makes me think that now perhaps SVG-based user interfaces are within the realm of possibility. CSS is no way to design UIs. I have a podcast in the pipe about this. If you want to know what I mean, look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/misc/quickdrawApiSummary.pdf&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/19/152802.html&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>To people who read my blog. If you have a quick thought about something you read here, it's ok if you send me an email. It should be short and not personal, if it adds some info or perspective that might be interesting, or if you just agree feverishly (not so much if you disagree, please) drop me a line. My return address on the nightly emails is my real email address. And you can find the address on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=about&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. Also sometime soon I think there will be a way to read my blog inside WordLand, so you can post a response to something I wrote, on your own blog, and I can get a link to it. I think this is the best of both worlds. You maintain the integrity of your blog, all your comments are in the same place, and if I think my readers would benefit, I can link it into my blog. I don't think we need comments, in other words. I think our blogs are powerful enough with some new code.</description>

And so different from the web we were just beginning to understand at that time. I'm going to start going through the posts that I remember making a difference at the time. No better way for me to remember what the web is, going back to these memories when it was all fresh and new, before the leaders of tech realized what was going on. Google didn't ship for another two years. It probably wasn't even in development at the time. Yet I think the last section is a good anthem for the web, for those of us who think it's time to cut pop all the bullshit off the stack and get back to our roots.</description>

			<title>feedland.org or feedland.com?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This question has come up quite a bit lately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't know that there are two places you can use FeedLand, feedland.org and feedland.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of history here, and some uncertainty about the future, so there's not much I can do other than explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First you're welcome to use either of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;feedland.org is running on a simple small server on Digital Ocean, and feedland.com is on Automattic's VIP network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If feedland.org gets overloaded, it gets slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;if feedland.com gets overloaded, it adds more servers and should stay about the same at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You should pick one and use it and not have two accounts, but people accidentally create them, because in some places we point to .com and in others we the default is .org. It's because we haven't gotten it together yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are also performance issues on .com -- ones that we still need to address. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's about all I can say at this point. At the same time I'm working on a whole other product while all this is happening, and I'm not that young, and really can only work so many hours a day before I have to stop. A fact. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I'm really glad so many new people are trying FeedLand. I use it myself in so many ways. And it will be deeply integrated with WordLand in the next release. I'm not kidding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A very smart application of AI. Google could add it to the debugger. When my program crashes deep in jQuery code, with no stack crawl, it could suggest what the problem might be without me have to try to describe it for ChatGPT. The Google AI debugger would be able to look everywhere any anywhere in the virtual machine. Much faster than I can. As a programmer I hope they're working on this.

			<source:outline text="A very smart application of AI. Google could add it to the debugger. When my program crashes deep in jQuery code, with no stack crawl, it could suggest what the problem might be without me have to try to describe it for ChatGPT. The Google AI debugger would be able to look everywhere any anywhere in the virtual machine. Much faster than I can. As a programmer I hope they're working on this.

The name of the product was Really Simple Something. I said it was the first I heard of it. I did a little digging using ChatGPT and found they can do this, it’s not illegal or unethical. But it’s also true that you could invent a new format and call it HTML even if it isn’t what we think of as HTML today . The W3C would have no recourse. If you wanted to make a new CSS to compete with the existing CSS, no one can stop you, and you can call it CSS. Not a good way to run the internet imho. But that appears that's how it works. So as much as I didn't like what they did, esp the fact that the first I heard of it was a public announcement, and had no time to prepare or maybe even help them do something better, I guess we have to accept it. RSS has been through this before and came out okay. I just wish it would stop at some point. It's a useful thing, deserves &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/09/11/123936.html#a124132&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; and support, not just from me, but from everyone, esp people who run companies that depend on it. You benefit as much as I do. End of sermon.</description>

			<title>Embrace the creativity of others</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in October 1996 after attending a conference of the tech industry that as it turns out was in its final stages. This was one of the last times it met. I was coming from the web, and wanted to see if anyone else was ready to change how we work with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been following that ideal ever since, people seem to misinterpret it for subservience or weakness, or a pretense to cover another kind of greed, when it's really sincere, and all about strength. Sometimes people say yes, and when that happens magical things happen. I swear to god. I've been there. I've done it, it's not something you can do on your own, by definition. It's rare when people actually help each other and thereby create something. It's why the Beatles are such a great story. Someday I still hope to be part of a group like that. Right now, it's still &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; everyone for themself.  That is breaking. Read the news. But I believe if we did start really collaborating and not just talking about it, things would change very very quickly. Things would happen that can't happen until we work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had it figured out in 1996, but still haven't figured out how to make it happen, and time &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; running out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I had a great time, and learned a lot. It's interesting that while I am not a member of the WordPress community, there is a big intersection between that community and one I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; belong to -- the web. WordPress was founded on the principles and idealism of the web. It's baked in. So it might be the largest community of users, not exclusively developers, who have the same values as the web, which are very very powerful values. I'm rediscovering them and it's wonderful. It means I can plug your app into my server and they work first time. It's the &lt;i&gt;just works&lt;/i&gt; part that makes it the web. It makes you suck in your breath and go, I'm there now. One interesting thing that came up was the subject of altruism, which is something I reject re myself. It doesn't work if what I do is altruism, because we all must be somewhat committed to the success of our competitors, because if we don't we are locking people in. It's so important that users have freedom of movement. If they don't things stagnate like our 19 years of Twitter. I'm going to be Nathan's show again, and again if he'll have me, to check in on the progress of my humble project to create a new layer, combining WordPress and all the other good stuff that isn't hooked up to it yet. I could not have hoped for a better introduction to The Land of WordPress.</description>

			<title>It's really simple</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reminder: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;Sept 18&lt;/a&gt;, one week from today, is the 3rd anniversary of the 20th anniversary of the release of RSS 2.0. I often forget to mark that day. It's not an event that's marked by others very often, but in my humble opinion, it deserves more respect than it gets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Around the time of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; I decided to swing back and see what more we could do with RSS. It had been sitting there basically going nowhere for most of those 20 years. I want to be clear, there were good and useful products created and supported, but there was none of the innovation that would have happened if it hadn't been so severely injured by Google and the many VC-backed startups hacking away at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A format like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; has to be loved. And if you make it too complicated or vague, with too much political shuffling of the deck what you get is ActivityPub. That's what RSS would have become if it went down the path the tech industry wanted to take it down. We have a perfect artifact to look at. An A-B comparison. Couldn't be more stark. And, after almost 23 years, RSS is still simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, around the 20th anniversary, in the leadup to it, I decided if no one else was going to invest in RSS, I would, and let's see what comes of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The result was &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; which is fundamentally different from all the other feed readers in that its subscription model is patterned after the twitter-like social media apps. Everyone's subscription list is public. I can look at your list and you can look at mine. You can also put categories on the feeds you subscribe to and route them to other servers doing other things, through the magic of the web. And get this -- you can even subscribe to a category of my subscriptions. Lots of power there, but still it's simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FeedLand is the perfect back-end for a twitter-like system, for the feeds part. And for the words, the perfect back-end is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I only discovered that about 1.5 years ago. And I had to see what it looks like. No more &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;, WordLand is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;real editor&lt;/a&gt; that supports the basic writing features of the web. How do I know? Because it saves its data in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. That has come to be the defining format for the text-based web. One which has been totally ignored by the twitter-like systems. Markdown is like MP3. If you're mixing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html&quot;&gt;sound into feeds&lt;/a&gt; you use MP3 of course. It's there for you to use. As was Markdown. If you're mixing text you're mixing Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So while everyone was dancing on Twitter's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster_fire&quot;&gt;dumpster fire&lt;/a&gt; of a social network I decided to build on something much bigger. The web. RSS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. WordPress and FeedLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;i&gt;Really Simple Syndication&lt;/i&gt; is supposed to make you smile, while most techie formats make you want to pull your hair out. RSS reads pretty well even if you know nothing about feeds and XML. I wish the browser people hadn't insisted on masking it with ugly CSS style sheets. I like lifting the hood of a car to see what's there even though I don't know what many of the things in there do. I learn by doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;RSS isn't ugly, it's brilliant, and shouldn't be fear-inducing, hence the promise: it's really simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://climbtothestars.org/&quot;&gt;Stephanie Booth&lt;/a&gt;, an OG blogger of great renown, now has a FeedLand &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on her WordPress blog. It is I believe going to make her blog feel less &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/blogs-don-t-need-to-be-so-lonely&quot;&gt;lonely&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone else wants to get one going, I have more confidence that it's pretty do-able. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/10/stephanieBlogroll.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Heh. Yesterday I started writing a post about something Brent wrote on his blog, and then I must've gotten distracted and didn't finish it. I will now proceed to explain.</description>

			<description>Brent &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he cares about desktop software but not about phone and tablet versions of same. I found that liberating. It's always been a pain in the ass to do something beautiful on the desktop only to have to destroy its utility by squeezing it into a space with no keyboard or pointing device that's more accurate than my finger (I have huge fingers, and a normal size phone). I found it liberating, but -- I'm working on the design of an app that should work well on either a phone or a laptop, and I've had that in mind the whole life of the product. But now I realize in a new way that it's a choice. It always was, but it didn't &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; that way.</description>
