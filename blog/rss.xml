The fact that you can see this in my Mastodon account means that it's working at a new level.</description>

			<description>The blogosphere which was absorbed by twitter for $0 was eventually turned into a Nazi frat party for Elon. That was the end result, that and billions for Ev, Jack, Biz, Union Square and Spark, and we’re back where we were when they took over. 16 years wasted.</description>

			<description>I can't tell you how convenient it is that Mastodon has the same name as my first real internet presence on CompuServe in the early 80s, also Mastodon. I have a whole language already designed to go with that name. Mastodoctor, for example. For a while we were all adding &quot;bunny&quot; to our names, so I became Mastobunny and then Mastobun for short. Most of these names are available, so I'm tempted, but so far I've resisted. I have bought a couple though. Like most domain names I buy, I'll probably never use them. But it's nice they're there. I keep hoping someday to come up with a service that deserves the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://ou.rs/&quot;&gt;ou.rs&lt;/a&gt; which I've been renewing for many years.</description>

			<description>I had a great talk with Doc Searls yesterday. They're always expressive and irreverant. We had fun at the expense of New Jersey, Kevin Durant, The Nets and of course the current mess at Twitter. I keep thinking we should do a podcast. If there was anyone in the world I want to do one with it would be Papa Doc.</description>

			<title>Mastodon nomenclature?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bullmancuso.com/&quot;&gt;bullmancuso.com&lt;/a&gt; is an imaginary friend with a personal home page. This is a well understood concept. It could be a blog, or an about page, a resume. A web page that is associated with a person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There could be subdomains like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ftp.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;smtp.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;news.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If he set up a Mastodon server, what should it be called?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;social.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;masto.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;microblogs.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;friends.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or is the Mastodon server so important that it should take the top spot, with just the naked domain. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're also going to need domains that serve as API glue, just like we have for Twitter. What should those be called? That's a less important question because the only places such a domain would appear is in an app that interfaces with Mastodon servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/241&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have very vague but strong memories of the JFK assassination. I was 8, in second grade, my teacher, Miss Ruffino, rushed out of the classroom in tears, no idea why.

I understood Kennedy was President, but he was the only president I had known. The idea of someone other than Kennedy being president didn’t make any sense. I asked my mom, what now. Someone named Johnson would be president. It didn’t make any sense to me. Kennedy was president.</description>

			<description>To &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; users. If Twitter turned us off for some reason you’d still be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/11/17/122301.html&quot;&gt;read your news&lt;/a&gt; while we worked around the outage. But so far there have been no problems that I’m aware of, and rushing to change tested software is a sure way to break things. That said we're making good progress on hooking up to Mastodon. Planning to show off a new way to do news products with FeedLand, and I want to write Mastodon threads in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. Those will be the first steps. ☘️</description>

After a year, I still love driving it. but it's funny -- no Nazis or smelly wanna be dictators show up in the passenger seat when I'm driving .

			<title>Trump is all wrung out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had to say this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1594372293723045888&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is making the same mistake that Kevin Durant did when he signed with the Nets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First thing he did after signing, he had a press conference where he dis'd the Knicks. I guess he was thinking there was some kind of rivalry. There wasn't. No one had any feelings at all for the Nets. A complete zero among NY basketball fans. And the Knicks, well we have a lot of heart there and for the most part it's an ache. The last thing we have any energy for is an idiot who has no idea of the place he's entered, and where we're at, basketball-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Musk has no idea where Twitter users are re Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what led him to believe anyone had any more juice for Trump. Even the people who liked him are tired. He had a good run, as far as &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; go, but we're just tired. Not even remotely excited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump is all wrung out. Even he knows it. But somehow that fact escaped Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Jew Hate is all around us</title>

I had this idea before I was conscious, before I was in school. Yet I knew all along that I was a Jew. Where did I get it from? I guess I grew up in it. It must've come from my family and neighbors and schoolmates, even teachers, and on TV, in music and radio. Reading. Who knows. But it was there. It still is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that's why I don't use the word &quot;antisemitism&quot; any more. It sounds so technical, almost benign. Instead let's call it what it is -- Jew Hate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Jew Haters practice their hate, they're moving the needle towrd Holocaust, which even though it's a very strong word isn't strong enough. It's genocide. The killing of an entire ethnic group, systematically, with the goal of eliminating all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't think anything we do can eliminate or even reduce Jew Hate. But letting it out of its box and into the public conversation as it has been lately, amazingly coming from black men, that despite what Jon Stewart says, that is not okay. It's not liberal to allow Jew Hate to be laughed at on SNL. Or to allow an NBA star to shout it from his million-follower Twitter account, or for a pop singer to say he wants to kill Jews, again on a million-follower Twitter account. When you do that, you invite all the other Jew Hate to come out and play. And once it's out, that means Jews are going to die. Once out, it might not be possible to stop it. Something to think about Jon Stewart when they take you and your family away for your final solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm old and tired and fed up with accepting that it's too dangerous to speak up about this. If no one else will, I guess, I will. If no NBA star will reassure me that the NBA is not filled with Jew Haters, I'm going to assume it is. I will never watch an NBA game without thinking that every black man on the floor hates me because of my ancestry and blames me for their misery and would like to see me and my kin killed in a horrible way. I don't wish that for them. But I also can't enjoy a sport where the participants feel that way about me, and they don't even know me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think you're liberal and a fair-minded person and just another Good American, it 's time to say something. Otherwise you're going to have to explain to your grandchildren what you did as it was happening again, only this time in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Further Tesla users spend tens of thousands of dollars to become users, and Tesla could brick their cars any time they want, and we're not connected to each other. Same with SpaceX of course. And even worse than that, most of Twitter's users are either journalists, bloggers, or podcasters. So there's that too. And every one of them is sure Elon Musk is fucking it up. All of this foerseeable, btw.</description>

			<description>To all the old school bloggers, remember how you all used to hate me? This is how it works. It's very rare that in an online space people love the top person, if they are accessible. If they're aloof, hard to find, or speak in haiku, you love them. But if you can talk to them and they might respond, most of what you're going to say to and about them will be negative. I know -- I lived on the other side of that for a number of years. It was fucked up. Absolutely nothing I said would be interpreted as if it were said like a human, like themselves.</description>

			<title>FeedLand w/o Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have said they don't want to use FeedLand because it uses Twitter for identity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always forget to mention that you can access most of what's in FeedLand without logging in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, here's my feed list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can go almost anywhere. You won't see the features that make it easy to subscribe to a feed, or add to your own personal feed, maybe one or two other things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But most of the product does not require login.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to marry FeedLand to Mastodon via RSS and maybe later ActivityPub. In case you can't tell I love Mastodon. Everything about it so far. Maybe I wish ActivityPub were based on RSS, but I got over that when I saw how nice the software is. That's what really matters, that and interop and not locking users and developers in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FeedLand pushes RSS into lots of new places. RSS has been kind of stagnant for a long time. I decide to do something about that at the end of last year. The result is FeedLand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Marrying Mastodon does not mean divorcing Twitter. I love Twitter too. People should stop being so chauvinistic about software. Mastodon will never be Twitter and vice versa. Each are their own thing. What matters is the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mastodon and RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The more I learn about Mastodon, the more impressed I am. It's a very nicely done piece of software. And unlike Twitter, they have RSS feeds for every user. Just add a .rss to the end of the URL and you get a nice feed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://mastodon.social/@davew.rss&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. When I look at the feed I see something someone put some love into. Or if it was a team, they worked well as a team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do have a couple of suggestions to make, based on experience providing these feeds basically in all the software I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please give the user a way to change the channel-level title and description for the feed. The reason — my feed doesn’t say it’s from my Mastodon account, so when an update shows up in FeedLand it’s missing that context. The user has a better idea of the context for the feed, how many other feeds they have and how this one relates to those feeds. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There also is a simple instant notification protocol in RSS 2.0 called rssCloud. I’d be happy to show you how to turn it on.

I'd love to work with the people who do this part of Mastodon to make this feature even better than it already is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's what my Mastodon feed looks like as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; in FeedLand and as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>All the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; emanating out of MastodonLand is blowing my mind. We're all part of the same freaking religion. This has been an incredible day, and I expect tomorrow to be even more so. I have a list of things I want them to look at. For example I think Mastodon's outgoing feeds should support &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; so we can get instant updates. I would be happy to show them how it works and help them do the adaptation. Basically all they have to do is add some info to their feed, and ping a special server when they update the feed. We take care of the rest.</description>

Also repeating the text where the title goes is not useful or correct, and if your reader does that, it should be fixed.

			<title>Follower counts on Masto</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do they play around with follower counts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At twitter they most certainly do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are people with millions of followers who were given those for being friends of the founders. I don't know if they still do it, but in the early days it was very observable. All of a sudden one day a person who had 200 followers had 10000 and then a million the next day. And many of them were nobodies, and a lot of them were journalists who wrote puff pieces about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We even saw a case where a journo was punished for writing a piece based on leaks from their board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was not a secret. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Artists don't hide</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading a lot of music history. When a new album came out, every musician would listen, in the first days. They’d go to their shows. Listen and let it affect their own creative process.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Beatles went to a Jimi Hendrix show in London and heard him cover Sgt Pepper, a week after the album came out!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software years and years go by and no one looks. Can you believe a book about innovation in languages came out, and no chapter about Frontier. All the new ideas, still not in the vocabulary of designers, decades later, I hope not lost to history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think of themselves as friends of mine not willing to spend even five minutes to find out what FeedLand or Drummer are. The first has been out for a month, the latter, a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think you’re practicing software art, but you’ve got yourself cloistered and protected from outside influence, you are a pretender, not an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
