			<description>Here's something that matters. Somehow ChatGPT gets the story right about my various contributions. You'll see all kinds of BS in Wikipedia and other various highly rated sites. Somehow ChatGPT sees through the bullshit, and usually gets the story right. So when people say that human reporting is better than machine reporting, I think this may be one of those cases where conventional wisdom is wrong. The human record is relatively easy to manipulate if the researchers are lazy and/or dishonest.</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if there was a social web toolkit with the basic building blocks so we could experiment with different UI and behaviors. Why, after so many years are we still so controlled. When and why did we give up?</description>

How incredibly insulting. It's just like what Trump says about Jewish Americans being loyal to Israel. Such an un-American idea. We all got here different ways. Some for a better life, some for life at all, others as slaves. But the United States is a big-hearted idea -- the &lt;i&gt;United&lt;/i&gt; States. It's unfortunate that such a small-minded &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;united person is so powerful now. We still have a long way to go.</description>

			<title>Google and The Innovator's Dilemma in 2024</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's overwhelming how much ground Google has to cover to get AI into all their products, but that's what they think they have to do, and I more or less agree. They feel they have to because their main product, search, is threatened by ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/17/innovatorsDilemma.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/5ab4f305-0d0d-4cba-b7d7-0b5debf06a6c&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma&quot;&gt;Innovator's Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;  in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation-dp-1633691780/dp/1633691780/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; published in 1997. It's why Netscape was able to undermine Microsoft when the web came out. Microsoft had a huge beast they had to move, Windows, and all its apps, and while they had a hardcore, scrappy and rich culture, they couldn't overcome the inertia that comes from being dug in, with their cannons pointed at the already-vanquished IBM, not the upstarts that came from the VCs in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and the rest of the PC industry had written off Unix, but there it was, again -- ugly as ever, but with networking that really worked and was easy, and the users wanted networking even though Microsoft wanted them to want Office. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google did the same with AI. As did Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. They had AI projects, and used AI in limited areas, as did Microsoft with Unix in the early 90s. But they couldn't bet everyting on it like a startup can. Now they have to. But the they don't have the tools needed to fight the new war. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; the dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the toughest corner any tech company has to turn, but there is an approach that could work for Google. Their strength is distribution. They have all the users. They can take a product that's ready for the world to market in a day. But they can't develop it. You can't snap your fingers and have a good new UI for every one of their products, ready in a year, although they will try as MS tried to adapt Office to the web. They don't have the right people or corporate culture to do that. Instead you have to hope you can find a great bootstrapping startup outside to work with, and use their strength as a distributor to help them. This is what I recommended for Microsoft in the 1990s, and I think I was vindicated, it would have imho worked a lot better than the path they chose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But now, their third time around this loop, Microsoft has learned! With their OpenAI partnership they've done exactly what I recommended in the 90s. They still have to convert all the old software and their user interfaces around the new capabilities, but at least they also own a share of a bootstrap that's now booming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I am blessed to have lived long enough now to have been part of now six different rearrangements like this. I love that we have now gotten there again. There's absolutely no doubt now, imho. The six rearrangements -- minis, PCs, GUIs, web, Napster, and now AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is all my opinion, and from the polls I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/16.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, it's obvious that many of the people within earshot don't agree or have seen the light yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Knicks and the Epic Fart</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dave to ChatGPT: I just read a news story that the Knicks won the last game in the playoffs because of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=knicks+epic+fart&quot;&gt;epic fart&lt;/a&gt; in the locker room. Can you draw a light-hearted illustration of that event?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/17/epicFart1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Version 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I asked for a serious and dramatic illustration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/17/epicFart2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Version 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine you can bet on who the farter was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My guess would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein&quot;&gt;Hartenstein&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The thing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;Casey Newton predicts&lt;/a&gt; for Google and news has already happened for the huge base of reference info and know-how for software development. We no longer go to the sources, don't need to, the ChatGPT version is an order of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into the AI database. We're going somewhere here. It's worth going there, imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the now and near-future. But it's as big a step as the move to PCs, then GUIs, the web, mobile.</description>

What we do need is people to keep asking and answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into the AI database. We're going somewhere here. It's worth going there, imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the now and near-future.

I'd like to create a notebook of info I'd like it to have available for people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that sometimes don't make it into the docs. But when I'm working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine, my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow pre-digest it. I wish I had a panel of experts about this stuff, but I guess they'd have to be human, at least at this point in time.

I'm discovering new significance for it every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be simple from the user's point of view, and in order for it to work technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It's a tall order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I'm confident I've covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press release? If you want to understand a new technology, don't talk to the CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are whirlwinds, they don't have time or the capacity to understand how big the idea is, they just know that it is big. If you want to understand you have to use it and you have to talk with other users.</description>

In the meantime if they had let me pay them $0.50 to read the freaking article, I might have linkblogged it to people who follow me via RSS or email, or on Bluesky or Mastodon, thus giving them a chance to sell others on paying $0.50 to read the freaking article. Not promising I'd do that, but if they really answer the question, if I really learn something I certainly would pass it along. Come on USA Today, get conscious.

Also there never will be another Steve Jobs, it's too bad everyone is using his template for product announcements. It only works if you're Steve Jobs.</description>

We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.</description>

I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where &quot;future&quot; is less than a year away.</description>

			<title>Brunson as bad man or decoy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/14/brunson.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson&quot;&gt;Jalen Brunson&lt;/a&gt;, Knicks star, after having his ass kicked in Sunday's game. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season&quot;&gt;bench players&lt;/a&gt;, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been trying the new 4o version of ChatGPT. It's much faster. It certainly is a search engine. And it covers news. I asked it about Michael Cohen's testimony today in the Trump trial, and it gave me a summary. I asked for the weather forecast in Kingston NY. It wouldn't give me the lyrics to Martha My Dear by the Beatles. I asked it to draw a weather map of the mid-Atlantic states, but it drew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/13/205122.html&quot;&gt;usual garbage&lt;/a&gt; for technical images.</description>

			<description>Here's where we're headed now that we have AI programming partners. Creating software will be possible the way popular music is created. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt; was the Beatles sherpa, the same way my AI partner is my guide through unknown programming lands. It now doesn't matter if I have less experience building MySQL apps than others. I have the collective experience of &lt;i&gt;all of them&lt;/i&gt; here to help. My George Martin. What got me thinking about this is John Naughton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/11/chatgpt-ai-will-co-pilot-coders-to-new-heights-of-creativity?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about AI and programming.</description>

			<description>Pretty sure I understand why Jack Dorsey is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.piratewires.com/p/interview-with-jack-dorsey-mike-solana?data-crypto-dot-news&quot;&gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt; with Bluesky. The mistake they made at Twitter was taking responsibility for enforcing decorum, which is completely diseconomic. A fully decentralized system is very different. That was why he funded Bluesky, to make a social web that wouldn't have at its center a company responsible for content.</description>

			<title>The NYT runs on freedom and apparently they don't know that</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a hard idea to get across, but there's nothing wrong with a news organization favoring things they depend on to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, a news org that covers San Jose, CA is entitled to favor San Jose. It's okay for them to do things that help San Jose in competition with other cities. They could sponsor a food drive for the neediest in their community. It wouldn't be a conflict of interest, because it's understood that they have an interest in the success of San Jose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A columnist that covers the NY Mets can be happy when the Mets win the World Series, and sad when they don't. This is not an integrity issue, or something they need to disclose, unless it's not obvious that they cover the Mets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that sense, every news org in the United States depends on the First Amendment, so it can be assumed they're in favor of democracy, because without it they couldn't exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why the editor of the NYT's statement about not favoring democracy is so ridiculous. He can't be objective about that, because the existence of his organization depends on the continuation of democracy in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whether he knows it or not, he's against Trump and in favor of the Democrats in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's hard to see what's totally obvious. Ask a fish about water and they'll say there is no such thing. Same with free speech and the NYT. They are a product of free speech, without it, it makes no sense, doesn't work. But that's been true forever, so it feels like a given, but it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's a bridge too far for many people. In other words, your understanding of feeds (RSS, Atom, etc) can be of service to others. And by collecting useful sources of news, maybe even insightful ones, we can help upgrade the quality of news we all get. The first step is to learn how to use FeedLand, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md&quot;&gt;it's pretty easy&lt;/a&gt;, esp if you already understand feeds. And with categories and OPML subscription lists, you can organize your feed reading everywhere, not just in FeedLand.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.co/company/press/archive/openai-partnership&quot;&gt;StackExchange and OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; have made a deal. I used to use StackExchange all the time, now I never do, ChatGPT is much better. There's a lot of anxiety out there, it seems but this is like shutting the barn door after the horse has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close_the_stable_door_after_the_horse_has_bolted&quot;&gt;bolted&lt;/a&gt;. There was a time when StackExchange was a godsend for programmers. But that time has passed. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. I was trying to figure out why some ancient code wasn't working. I never understood how it worked, and now I had to figure out what was going wrong. So I debugged it, carefully, step by step, with ChatGPT. It's as if I was working with another programmer who had read and fully understood every StackExchange message, and was willing to work with me for no pay to get to the bottom of the problem. This is what we call disruption. It's a whole new level of programming. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134&quot;&gt;Voice Memo app&lt;/a&gt; to take notes while I'm programming. Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an &lt;i&gt;edited&lt;/i&gt; version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end). I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/&quot;&gt;$AAPL&lt;/a&gt; is depressed because the lack of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html&quot;&gt;AI story&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a use that every stock trader will understand immediately. Huge value. I'm sure others are doing it. But Apple has the high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I've owned a bunch of Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and I'm right.)</description>

And if I want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/08/blogrollscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;see what's new&lt;/a&gt;, I just click on the wedge next to its name to reveal the most recent five posts.

			<description>BTW, I was struck that famous editor and writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@semaforben@threads.net&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; said he was ashamed at starting out as a blogger, on an MSNBC show hosted by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough&quot;&gt;true hack&lt;/a&gt;. The quote was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who like me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303&quot;&gt;cross-posts&lt;/a&gt; to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it. My comment: &quot;I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. What’s wrong with people?&quot; Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
