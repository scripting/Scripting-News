Hours with ChatGPT, realizing it has a long way to go before it can manage code like I can. It gets fixated on an approach and never takes a step back to think maybe we're going about this the wrong way. It's extremely annoying all the times it tries to take you off track, and it works, it does take you down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole&quot;&gt;rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt; and then you realize it's only getting worse. The key is to not let it do that, but it's hard not to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism&quot;&gt;anthropomorphize&lt;/a&gt; so you don't want to hurt its feelings. In order to not be murdered as a small child you have to learn manners. And the bots push that too far. Really do take advantage. Still it knows far more than I do about everything, so if I could only get it to just shut the f up already and let me think! For something so capable it really doesn't spend enough time thinking, it's fully preoccupied with &lt;i&gt;doing.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons&quot;&gt;Detroit Psssstons&lt;/a&gt; were truly great in the first round of the playoffs. And I was really gratified, ecstatic even, to see the Timberwolves give the Lakers a complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2010/11/04/131075640/how-shellacking-came-to-mean-defeat&quot;&gt;shellacking&lt;/a&gt;. I am so fed up with LeBron James. I can't imagine another team would want him. I can't imagine why he wants to win &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; freaking title. And I was really pissed off when people started saying they were contenders this year. Bull. Shit. And the reason I'm glad it was the Timberwolves is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle&quot;&gt;Julius Randle&lt;/a&gt; is on that team now, and I hear he gets a fair amount of credit for their victory. The Knicks traded him for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns&quot;&gt;KAT&lt;/a&gt; last summer. They're a solid team. And while &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo&quot;&gt;Donte DiVincenzo&lt;/a&gt; isn't playing very well, we really need him back in NY, so maybe the Knicks can figure out a deal that makes sense. And why aren't the Knicks playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa&quot;&gt;Precious Achiuwa&lt;/a&gt;. He did great last year when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby&quot;&gt;OG&lt;/a&gt; was injured. The Knicks have a good bench imho, they just don't get to play enough to be warmed up properly. So sad the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride&quot;&gt;Doooooce&lt;/a&gt; performed in the Detroit series. Anyway it was exhausting. I would have been okay with the DP's winning, seriously -- I'm ready for baseball. And I don't imagine the next series, with the Celtics will be any kind of a walk in the park.</description>

And while it is a rewrite, for a lot of people it looks exactly the same. That's because of differences in how email clients deal with HTML.</description>

He was a novelty then, an American politician who was a socialist. He was asked if capitalism was the normal way for humans to relate, he said no. I wonder if he still agrees, because I think that's the goal, and the reason we're in so much trouble is there really isn't an impulse to work with each other. What I've seen mostly is that when there's work to do, it's hard to find help, but once something has taken off, there isn't much help available either, the people who could make the greatest contribution just want to take over. And they often feel they have, but usually it doesn't work out, it would have been better if we all collaborated. At this point, the hurdle the human race has to get over &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; working together. We will never get out of the climate crisis without it, or avoid the next pandemic without millions of unnecessarily lost lives. The cynics are winning, basically -- and there isn't net-net much of a will for our species to survive. It's only getting worse.</description>

			<description>I turned yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/&quot;&gt;Baseline Playground&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. I never made one of these before and thought it was worth sharing, or just writing about. I'm struggling to find the most readable font, size, line-height. I'm looking at the screen where I do most of my online writing, and I find this very readable, it just fades into the background, to the base of the spine, so intrinsic it occupies none of my conscious mind. Anyway the purpose of the baseline is to give WordLand a target to work out all the glitches in, so the writing experience goes fully end-to-end. I didn't find any WordPress themes that I felt worked really well for this, so we set out to create one. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde&quot;&gt;Scott Hansen&lt;/a&gt; who is using my work to build out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline&quot;&gt;WordPress theme&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeherve&quot;&gt;Jeremy Herve&lt;/a&gt; for helping us work with WordPress, which is more than a CMS, it's a network OS. There's a lot of value in the WordPress platform that has been widely overlooked, imho.</description>
