Google search, for example. I should have great search for my blog by now, powered by Google. It has been here for 26 years. They should have been doing R&amp;D on how they can be part of a better reading environment on the web. But reading on the web has just gotten worse over the years. It's why we don't like clicking on links, usually what we find at the other end of the link is obnoxious. To get some peace and quiet we had to go to Twitter of all places, but now that's gotten ridiculous too. The only corner of the web where there's real exciting innovation is ChatGPT. And what's tragic about that is we've never made search work on the web, and search is valuable too, not just the digested version of what was said that ChatGPT produces. But I'd like some of my writing to survive the Great Ingestion. Writing matters, how humans express themselves matters. In other words we still have work to do in search, AI does not fill that need, at least not yet.</description>

			<description>An idea for a news org. I want a for-pay site where I can ask a question about the news and get the most up-to-date answer. I'd like to link to that page from a blog post, and have it either be frozen, to document where we were on that day, or dynamic, so that it changes over time. I'm sure this product will be here soon, so obvious.</description>

			<title>Harris &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; win, but..</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had the same thought as &lt;a href=&quot;https://presswatchers.org/2024/09/what-if-the-media-has-the-election-all-wrong/&quot;&gt;Dan Froomkin&lt;/a&gt;, of course -- esp given how much voodoo is in weighting various things, the polls are junk. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But, she &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be winning much bigger than the polls say. And wouldn't that be nice. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But do you remember part of the 2016 postmortem was that yeah it was a problem for the racists among us that we elected a black president, and now they want a woman president. Many of us thought this is the price we're paying for the euphoria we felt in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All he says about Harris is true. She's a dream candidate, she had my vote at &quot;Hello.&quot; How could anyone &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; see what's so obvious, here's someone who organized her party's support in the blink of an eye, and she was ready to run, all the pieces were in place in record time. Such competence, drive, humor, did I say drive? :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I worry that maybe all that was enough to get her even with Trump because now we're pressing the race and gender button again, and they still don't buy the idea of a non-white-male, Christian president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh and btw her husband is Jewish, and... all the childless bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I worry that we may be borderline fucked again. Pray. Pray, even if you don't believe.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Because I plan to add functionality to this space. I'm tired of all the stupid limits these products have. Titles or no titles. 300 character limits. No links, etc etc and on and on. Where did they get the idea that taking features out of writing was something they could do. What a wrong turn we took there. And now that once we have a chance to erase the limits, maybe -- none of the companies running their products are doing it. I don't want the way they do it to be the only way, the products are &lt;i&gt;deliberately&lt;/i&gt; incompatible. Social web is the best name for what I'm working on. So I need to reserve this space. They didn't ask for my opinion, the first I heard of it was a press release. When I ship my thing I want to point back at this and say look -- I did tell you this was going to be a problem.</description>

When the PC first came out there was PC Mag and PC World and then PC Week. Same for the Mac. And there was InfoWorld that covered everything. Now we're basically using smoke signals between users. A few really interested users could bootstrap a blog to keep track of what's going on, and share what you learn publicly. That was the advice I gave &lt;a href=&quot;site:scripting.com arrington&quot;&gt;Mike Arrington&lt;/a&gt; and he started TechCrunch and that acted as the glue that hooked together the early blogosphere, feeds and ultimately twitter and its offspring. We need it again. Users and developers party together has never been more needed as now.</description>

It's going to start raining at 1PM and won't stop until Friday afternoon. It's the end of the season and both the Braves and Mets are in the same wildcard battle. Do the Mets stay in Atlanta to ride out the storm, or head back to NY? It's far more weird than I have time to explain right now.</description>

			<description>Now that ActivityPub is &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/09/24/launch/&quot;&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web&quot;&gt;Social Web&lt;/a&gt;, I feel like Lloyd Bentsen at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator,_you%27re_no_Jack_Kennedy&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; with Dan Quayle. ActivityPub is not the web any more than Dan Quayle was Jack Kennedy. The web is simple. That was hard to do. Very little since then lives up to that standard of simplicity, definitely not ActivityPub. The web is the web is the web is the web etc. Pick another more humble name. If it ever does achieve the utility of the web does we can take another look.</description>

			<description>It would be great if we could make voting a party, a celebration, something to look forward to, not something you have to make time for. That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because we are the stars.</description>

			<title>A Hello World for Bluesky?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, a couple of examples/case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;1. About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node made it click. It's server software, so there must be a way to write an HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has, but what I needed was a Hello World script. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt; gave me the script, and step by step &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to write it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.  That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is, and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP server, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with a server that ran in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. I was ecstatic. That's the key. If you have something that isn't truly new, that might have some analogies in other worlds, if you want people in those other worlds to know how to get started, give them the beginning. The first step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was 1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use it, but I didn't know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense, because they talked about things I didn't understand. What I really needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how to use. I found one, a service provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html&quot;&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;. You emailed a message to them and they put it &quot;on the web&quot; and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and there's what you typed. I tried &lt;i&gt;Hello World&lt;/i&gt; and got back a link to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated, I did a view source of Hotwired.com's home page, and copy and pasted it into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were relative). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything I've ever learned how to do required me to first understand it at this level.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay here we are in 2024, and I want to understand what Bluesky is. I know how to use it, but I don't know how to &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; it. But I would be surprised if it is any more complicated that writing a web content management system that uses feeds, something I've done many times. I know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We're all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I hear there's some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don't care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the same kind of aha moment I had with the web. I want it to work when I try it, and I want it to reveal what Bluesky is beyond what I can see from using it. I want to begin to understand the opportunities for interop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why do I ask? For one, I'm a student of this stuff, and I want to understand. But I also am very active in this area, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop is my product&lt;/a&gt; (really read that piece, I mean it, and I think it's Bluesky's product too). I'm into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; -- it happens so infrequently. So here I'm also trying to show not just you how to explain what you do for a curious but time-limited developer, but I want to make this a this.how document that explains how to do it for everyone, hoping that we as an art and industry start explaining ourselves better to each other, because we absolutely need to do this much better imho, ymmv, mmlm, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To summarize -- assume I know how the web works. I've worked with the structures and protocols for systems that are very much like Bluesky. Don't try to explain the design of the protocol, just use it to solve a problem that I will understand because I use the product and I have developed lots of stuff like it. It should be possible to show us, to teach us, what your product does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It could take a few days to put a Hello World together. Because once you do the first iteration, you may think of a more direct way to illustrate the idea, and you should do it, iterate until it works, until you can't make it any simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: And if you don't want to do it, that's okay too. I just thought it was worth the effort to explain what's needed to foster a greater understanding of what you're doing and what the opportunities for interop are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It shipped 17 days go. It was hell to just tell Google that the case was lost. I expected at that point they'd apologize and refund the money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return the case when it arrives. It's never going to arrive. Luckily this is a cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1300 phone, that would be a pretty big problem. It's amazing that a company the size and age of Google doesn't have a procedure for dealing with products that are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I've been through this with Amazon, they knew what to do, because UPS does lose packages, esp ones that look like they have phones in them. Anyway I have a fairly large credit with Google. I don't dare use it to purchase anything else, given how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer problems.</description>

That's enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not expecting much more to happen there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting &quot;both sides,&quot; how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for you all to get in sync with the actual American history that's being made.</description>

There was a bug in this one line of code, a call to &lt;i&gt;new Date ()&lt;/i&gt; in JavaScript, that was behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified it as 0.</description>

			<title>Health is nothing to screw with</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since I'm about to turn 70 (next May), and because my body is getting old in ways it never has before (of course) -- I've become a more active participant in the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned is it can be hard to get the attention of the doctors. And once you see your GP about a problem it's almost certain they're going to send you to a specialist. So you go to the specialist and it's pretty random as to whether they put the effort into understanding your situation in full. And they aren't trying to solve all your problems, just the ones they deal in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, a couple of years ago I had a condition that ChatGPT diagnosed in a second but it took the doctors who weren't paying much attention (my primary care doctor had retired and I was being shuffled between NPs and MDs until they could find someone to be my new main doctor) so they were all sending me to the wrong specialists, all of whom said there was no problem, yet I still had the symptoms which were getting worse. On the fourth try, someone sent me to the right specialist and they instantly diagnosed what ChatGPT had diagnosed at the outset. So when people say AI could hurt medical care, I don't think so, it would probably be a good idea to have an AI looking over their shoulders and asking if they've considered the Occam's Razor specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you have to be alert, and push to get them to pay attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And communicating with the system is ridiculous. Almost everything has to be done over the phone. They have email, but if you want to set up an appointment, you have to call. And wait on hold. And wait and wait. And then it's a dice roll as to who you get connected to. There are some people you talk to who seem to be trying to be annoying. It's a total pain in the ass, but you have to do it. (And since they have to ask for your birthdate to identify you they know how old you are and treat you accordingly.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the health care for a person my age seems to be directed at finding the thing that's going to kill you and treating it. That's good, and that's a shift in perspective from someone who until recently had a young body which basically took care of itself. Or so it seemed (I did have emergency heart surgery at 47 that saved my life, although that's a fairly distant memory now).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So right now I have a thing that needs to be looked into because it might be one of those serious things. And it's really hard to get the system to respond quickly, because if it's serious it's one of those things that you want to deal with asap. I don't think it is, but you have to act as if it might be. And it can be humiliating to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's no law saying the doctor, or any of the others in the system, could go to jail or lose their license if they treat any illness I might have. I can now for the first time really understand what it might be like to have to deal with that in addition to all the other &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt; stuff you have to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the point of this post. Throwing a wrench into the already broken wheels of our medical system is the crime. They should go to prison for doing this, the six Supreme Court justices and other Republican assholes who stick their noses where they don't belong. There should be a penalty for what they're doing, they should have the fear they're putting women through. They should worry about what happens when their decision is overturned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they should lose their medical care as should all the members of their families. Then they might get an idea of how sinful they have been.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first draft of this post appeared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02emJvNBVscbSVgUsRaxg6tCWPYcZnfsJy7W2Tp6WU6iKfNtLVgKU8Nh69z8vmkGf8l&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of a new server app that combines the functionality of several apps I used to run as separate servers. The goal is to be able to integrate the functionality of all the components. It's time to invest in blogging in a real way. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017 corner-turn&lt;/a&gt; was about getting back to the foundation I had before trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no longer high value targets for interop. So while I wasted a lot of time trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/08/152655.html&quot;&gt;peer&lt;/a&gt; with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup while developed &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and in doing so learned how to do scalable server apps with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;. I've wasted so much time trying to be compatible with apps that didn't want us. I have a feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let's get back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;Open Web&lt;/a&gt;, which gave us much hope before. I think we can do a lot with feeds and &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. They're to open systems what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt; is to open source. You don't get to be half-committed to being open, you have to be all-in or you can't play. (Same idea as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+podcasting&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, which of course is just an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.) You don't have to deal with a lot of confusion to find the interop. You just have to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post and look what it has become.</description>

			<description>Has anyone attempted to make a higher level language on top of SQL? It's taken me a few iterations over years to finally (I hope) figure out how to design a table to take advantage of the features that evolved into making SQL efficient for the applications people really deploy. If this were machine language, it would be time to start thinking about the HLL that it inspires. Actually long past time imho.</description>

			<description>My Pixel 9 Pro keeps giving me tips on using it when I bring it up, as I'm trying to read an important message, or change something at a red light. I'm always distracted when I use the phone, and by adding more distractions to sell me on something, that's not their right. I paid $1300 for this new phone. And also I can't figure out how to get the phone to ring when I get a call. I keep missing important calls.</description>

			<description>I keep discovering uses for ChatGPT. I think it would be very useful to learn a language, for example. I know how to say this in English, could you explain to me, in English, how to say it in French. I bet it's very good at that. I am using it to learn to write SQL code that takes advantage of all the arcane features they've added over the years to handle cases that come up in real database work. It's anything but a new language, and efficiency is everything -- so I think they pretty much have all the cases covered. I remember how frustrating it was to learn Algol when all I knew before that was Fortran and Basic. It would have been great to have ChatGPT to coach me on it.</description>

			<title>Driving on a mountain road</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/06/03/tinaTheBearNurseFromBojackHorseman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was driving on a mountain road yesterday to pick up a pizza in a nearby town. I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so I drive at the speed limit or a little above. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates, getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road, deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never hit an animal, but I have come close.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to pass on this road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been in the other driver's place when a tourist is driving 30 in a 45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don't freak out. It's perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their horn. I slow down more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking okay they'll pass me now, and I'll get a chance to see who this asshole is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we come to the next stop sign, it's the end of the road and you can go left or right. I'm going right, they're going left, and the road is wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last kind of person I would expect to make such a scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I don't speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn't in any kind of a hurry. It's not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when I slow down and add a few car lengths between us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these stories. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to &quot;just happen&quot; organically.</description>

			<title>How I cross-post to Threads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;The RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; is doing a lot of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links from the RSS feed show up on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;give&lt;/a&gt; it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; of the linkblogging feed, and then click on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png&quot;&gt;Add Threads&lt;/a&gt; -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;Feeds page&lt;/a&gt; is where you set it up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was recruited to speak at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti&quot;&gt;Ria Novosti&lt;/a&gt; conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn't, seemed like a fair deal. Something about it didn't smell right though, so I stayed home.</description>

For me, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for ActivityPub but that's more complicated than it may seem. As often is the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I think it's better if we, as users, remain diversified.</description>

			<description>If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had, where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for retaining practices that work. It's a shame to work something out, come up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again 23 months later when you encounter the same problem.</description>

			<title>Ignore polls</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want a better idea of how it's going, look at where the ad dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And make sure all your friends know that you're voting and who you're voting for. I think that makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm voting straight Democratic party line.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Could we agree that ChatGPT can ingest everything that's in Wikipedia? I particularly want the images. I'd like to ask for a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry&quot;&gt;Chuck Berry&lt;/a&gt;, and get something nice and be able to put him in a scene with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wordle+kitty%22&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt;.

We had that for the blogging layer of this onion, something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;.  All the popular blogging software supported it. And that meant you could write once and publish to many places. And you could write the script that did that in an afternoon or two. We started out with simple systems and the best of intentions. There's no technical barrier. And we could do it in a few weeks at most if there was a will to do it</description>
