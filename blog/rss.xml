I thought this is nice, I thought their cooking site was extra money, which I refuse to pay because I think I already give them far too much money for the value I get. But when I clicked on one of the pictures I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/10/nytBaitAndSwitchForAPayingSubscriber.png&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; this is a &quot;subscriber-only recipe.&quot; This is incredibly disrespectful and probably unethical, because I was being conned by an ad, thinking it was journalistic content that I actually paid for. I used to love the NYT. I grew up reading them along with everyone else in my family. Now they betray that every chance they get. Whoever is running the NYT now is running it into the ground as far as I'm concerned.</description>

			<description>I wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; tried to do a deal with ChatGPT to flow human knowledge through their database. Or were they caught as flat-footed as&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica&quot;&gt;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica&lt;/a&gt; was by Wikipedia, or how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera#Types_of_digital_cameras&quot;&gt;digital cameras&lt;/a&gt; were obsoleted by smart phones. Was there anything any of them could do, or was there no possible corner-turn? Also newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising&quot;&gt;classified ads&lt;/a&gt; and Craigslist.</description>

			<description>I asked DALL-E to help create an icon for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;Feed Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. I can't imagine an art director at an agency not using AI to play around with ideas for logos, symbols, ads, whatever. What I arrived at was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/09/feedHunterIcon.png&quot;&gt;tennis racket&lt;/a&gt; trying to hit a cheeseburger. I didn't end up using it, but the exploration was useful. I think this process still has quite a ways to go, I find it difficult to control the bot, I give it explicit instructions sometimes that it apparently doesn't understand. But it's still a miracle of technology. And a miracle for this human, because I've found an artist that is infinitely patient with me, and works for $20 a month.</description>

Later when I got in the car it smelled terrible. So I took a picture of the car with the mice in it, and I want DALL-E to draw that for me.

			<title>Janis, Yogi and David</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Several recommendations this morning with a common theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;500 songs podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-169-piece-of-my-heart-by-big-brother-and-the-holding-company/&quot;&gt;Janis Joplin&lt;/a&gt;. Of course I listened to Joplin in the early 70s, and I remember where I was when I heard of her death. I always assumed she was the freak she presented herself as, that her singing came from her soul, but I learned from this episode that wasn't what we were seeing. That's what makes this podcast so interesting, it tells me about myself before I developed my fine-tuned skepticism, as we review the music of my Boomer life. I tended to believe the stories I was told. When I was a kid I loved to read biographies, but as time went by I knew some of the people who had bios written about them, in fact short bios were written about me in magazines. Since then I understand that the story and the actual person often have very little to do with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A similar story, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81712015&quot;&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/it-aint-over/&quot;&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt;, that makes you want to cry for love of the man and for the tragedy that his fame as a character, obscured the fame he deserves as an athlete. This version of the story is that the personality and the player were the same person, that without the sense he had of other people and strong sense of self, he wouldn't have been nearly as great on the field. Very emotional for me, and it did change how I look at the Yankees (I'm a Mets fan from a family of Dodgers fans), and I never really appreciated him when he became a coach and then manager of the Mets. I always felt the two teams couldn't integrate that way. A well-told story, I hope some of it is true. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally a Fresh Air interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/11/01/1197958207/fresh-air-draft-11-01-2023&quot;&gt;David Byrne&lt;/a&gt; of the Talking Heads. A very different personality from Janis or Yogi, obviously. I love the Talking Heads music, esp these days -- it's the best Peloton music. The interview is eye-opening, as he explains how he put his stage personality together and why he switched from violin to guitar as a kid. He also exudes confidence from a person who packaged his discomfort with himself as his message. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize until I wrote this up how well these three bits go with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Since then I understand that the story and the actual person often have very little to do with each other." created="Mon, 06 Nov 2023 14:37:45 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/06.html#a143745"/>
				<source:outline text="A similar story, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81712015&quot;&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/it-aint-over/&quot;&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt;, that makes you want to cry for love of the man and for the tragedy that his fame as a character, obscured the fame he deserves as an athlete. This version of the story is that the personality and the player were the same person, that without the sense he had of other people and strong sense of self, he wouldn't have been nearly as great on the field. Very emotional for me, and it did change how I look at the Yankees (I'm a Mets fan from a family of Dodgers fans), and I never really appreciated him when he became a coach and then manager of the Mets. I always felt the two teams couldn't integrate that way. A well-told story, I hope some of it is true. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 06 Nov 2023 14:40:31 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/06.html#a144031"/>

A very different personality from Janis or Yogi, obviously. I love the Talking Heads music, esp these days -- it's the best Peloton music. The interview is eye-opening, as he explains how he put his stage personality together and why he switched from violin to guitar as a kid. He also exudes confidence from a person who packaged his discomfort with himself as his message." created="Mon, 06 Nov 2023 14:43:19 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/06.html#a144319"/>

When I look at it, as an amateur in everything but what I specialize in, I see new ways to express myself. This is what technology has been doing since our species started thinking and sharing ideas, thus creating our civilization. So which should I value more, the new ideas I'll be able to send and receive, or protecting the cash flow of others. I get it, I used to depend on the cash generated from my software. But it's funny almost none of that money came from individual sales of software. And value is manifested in many other ways than dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last month for me has been a revelation, as I can talk with ChatGPT and get it to express my wishes to DALL-E in a language it understands better than I do, and the net result is I can show you visually how I think about things I write about here. For example, I've been trying to come up with a way to visualize RSS. Not as some dead thing as Google and others tried to make you see it as. Rather as a bunch of balloons on a perfect day in the high desert of New Mexico. I asked that every balloon say RSS, but it could only manage one. Still the point gets through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/05/rssBalloons.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;RSS as balloons in the New Mexico high desert.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You should feel proud of RSS because it was something created by you, not by the tech industry. We can do a lot more stuff like that if we choose to work together. It's one of those weird things like making a balloon lighter than air so you, a flightless animal, can fly around in the wind on a gorgeous day with other humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the ChatGPT and DALL-E connection we're finally somewhere I honestly never thought we'd get, at least not in my lifetime -- you will be able to write your own software by telling a computer what you want. And it will be infinitely better at listening to you, with its full attention, its mind engaged 100 percent, able to talk with you at whatever level you are able to. With that, you can certainly create software, and through trial and error that used to take decades of experience,  you can get results -- in weeks and months.  I don't want to scare you, my programmer colleagues, but our craft is being reformed by this too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried an experiment a few days ago. I got a random question that made no sense, about RSS and local files and seemed to depend on magic. I get these all the time and I don't have the intellectual ability or patience to understand what they're saying. So I pasted the email verbatim &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/5eaed401-dec7-44cd-a2a4-9725c4d99e65&quot;&gt;into ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and it answered the question. I sent the person a link to the answer, and he responded, cryptically as before, but apparently ChatGPT understood what he was asking for, where I did not. Now we're getting a glympse at the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's this Silicon Valley expression -- A‚Äôs hire A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs hire C‚Äôs. Here we are presented with that conundrum, but we're the B and we could hire an A. I guess that's the question.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, Andrew Hickey, who has opened my mind to &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, has made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/thoughts-on-now-92258652&quot;&gt;mistake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/05/hickeyQuote.png&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that the same people who promoted  NFTs and Bitcoin are the ones promoting AI. I saw &lt;i&gt;Web 3&lt;/i&gt; as a cheap exploitation of something open and wonderful, the Web, purely for greed. Like Exxon laying waste to the Arctic for more oil profits. Or if I started a band and called it Beatles II, and journalists went along with the con. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;AI is more challenging, not as clear-cut, and at the same time incredibly useful even seductive, and we need minds like Hickey's to look at this carefully and think, and use it as a tool, so he can help us understand what's going on. I've seen this many times, people I admire who have dismissed AI, but when I tell them not to, and they try to use it, they immediately get it. Hickey will be one of those people, I'm sure of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: BTW, the future never ends up looking like you thought it would. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Future of RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/31.html#a214551&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; specifically for Tim Carmody. But you can listen to, and I hope you do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do this from time to time, when I want to work with someone, I often will speak directly to them in public. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+working+together&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; is the only way to bootstrap open systems. I did it because I saw Tim, who I know as a smart tech writer, a creative person and thinker, as someone who could appreciate how little it takes to start a bootstrap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It worked. Yesterday he wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/23/11/the-future-of-rss-is-textcasting-1&quot;&gt;piece on kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; that got a lot of coverage. It got a lot of people thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The coolest thing he said are the first four words in the headline. &lt;i&gt;The Future of RSS&lt;/i&gt; -- you know I've never seen anyone write those four words because RSS got so thoroughly maligned by the bigco's of tech, they really did a number on RSS, probably because it was so freaking good and so freaking simple. Who needs big tech companies to make it usable for you if it's basically usable all on its own. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tim made the point I couldn't make on my own. People must think I have a conflict with RSS, but I've never made any money from RSS, I advocate on its behalf because I think it's the right thing to do. And I wanted to show Tim that if he did it, people would listen. And they did! Oh my. I heard about it from so many people. Did you see this piece on Kottke!? I was told/asked yesterday over and over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And maybe people are now beginning to see that RSS would make the perfect connective protocol in addition to the more complex ActivityPub for the next generation of social networks. He also got me excited, now knowing that I am not the only person trying to push this boulder up a hill. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Feeds are still there to help tie everything together. RSS only exists because people want it to exist. The more you want it to exist, the more it will. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So Tim, let's keep beating the drum. The goal as far as I'm concerned is to craft the perfect environment for writers on the web. We still have not tried to do that, because the BigCo's have convinced us that we need to be locked-in to get anything out of the tech. Well I'm here to tell you that's not true. And in the coming weeks and months I hope to prove it to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's time to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; stuff. Let's all work together on this. You'd be amazed how few people it takes to get something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I don't agree with everything Tim said in his list of four needs. I don't need metrics or moderation. Believe me, I know about abuse, I knew about it before all of you did, because in the beginning I was the target of most of the abuse in the blogosphere. I learned some fundamental things about abuse, don't offer people a way to abuse you and you won't be abused. It means don't think of this as a conversational medium, and don't count on everyone hearing you. Use it for thinking out loud, and be happy when people hear you, but don't expect it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: At the end Tim asks what his role is. He's a writer and damned good one and one who thinks about how his writing gets to readers.

				<source:outline text="Last Tuesday I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/31.html#a214551&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; specifically for Tim Carmody.

				<source:outline text="I do this from time to time, when I want to work with someone, I often will speak directly to them in public. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+working+together&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; is the only way to bootstrap open systems. I did it because I saw Tim, who I know as a smart tech writer, a creative person and thinker, as someone who could appreciate how little it takes to start a bootstrap." created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:06:46 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/04.html#a150646"/>
				<source:outline text="It worked. Yesterday he wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/23/11/the-future-of-rss-is-textcasting-1&quot;&gt;piece on kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; that got a lot of coverage. It got a lot of people thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:08:24 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/04.html#a150824"/>
				<source:outline text="The coolest thing he said are the first four words in the headline. &lt;i&gt;The Future of RSS&lt;/i&gt; -- you know I've never seen anyone write those four words because RSS got so thoroughly maligned by the bigco's of tech, they really did a number on RSS, probably because it was so freaking good and so freaking simple. Who needs big tech companies to make it usable for you if it's basically usable all on its own. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:35:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/04.html#a153519"/>
				<source:outline text="Tim made the point I couldn't make on my own. People must think I have a conflict with RSS, but I've never made any money from RSS, I advocate on its behalf because I think it's the right thing to do. And I wanted to show Tim that if he did it, people would listen. And they did! Oh my. I heard about it from so many people. Did you see this piece on Kottke!? I was told/asked yesterday over and over." created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:09:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/04.html#a150923"/>
				<source:outline text="And maybe people are now beginning to see that RSS would make the perfect connective protocol in addition to the more complex ActivityPub for the next generation of social networks.

				<source:outline text="So Tim, let's keep beating the drum. The goal as far as I'm concerned is to craft the perfect environment for writers on the web. We still have not tried to do that, because the BigCo's have convinced us that we need to be locked-in to get anything out of the tech. Well I'm here to tell you that's not true. And in the coming weeks and months I hope to prove it to you." created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:10:44 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/04.html#a151044"/>

				<source:outline text="PS: I don't agree with everything Tim said in his list of four needs. I don't need metrics or moderation. Believe me, I know about abuse, I knew about it before all of you did, because in the beginning I was the target of most of the abuse in the blogosphere. I learned some fundamental things about abuse, don't offer people a way to abuse you and you won't be abused. It means don't think of this as a conversational medium, and don't count on everyone hearing you. Use it for thinking out loud, and be happy when people hear you, but don't expect it." created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:13:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/04.html#a151343"/>
				<source:outline text="PPS: At the end Tim asks what his role is. He's a writer and damned good one and one who thinks about how his writing gets to readers. I haven't found many writers who are thinking about that, but imho they &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; should be, esp right now when the dominance of tech companies is so iffy, when the possibilities are so open.

			<title>WordPress for identity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't believe a product like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; should do its own identity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Identity is one of those things you totally want centralized, because that's the benefit of identity -- you can be the same person in a lot of different places. And if we work that out well, the apps that you connect with that way can work with each other in interesting ways to provide new integrations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always been preaching this, let developers and users do the integration, let software developers create basic capability that we can wire together any way we like. That was what we were doing on the Mac platform in the 1988-92. And also what we've been doing on the web since 1994 . It's an idea as old as &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mamrak.1/CIS762/pipes_lab_notes.html&quot;&gt;Unix pipes&lt;/a&gt;. But it requires cooperation among developers, which we have seen sometimes happens. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/226&quot;&gt;WordPress for identity&lt;/a&gt; is a step in that direction. The hope is it could form a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone&quot;&gt;backbone&lt;/a&gt; for an internet of applications. I'm willing to step up and say okay let's give this a try and see what happens.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to visualize &lt;i&gt;FeedLand&lt;/i&gt; to work toward a great logo for it, and had the idea of playing with ChatGPT and DALL-E to see what would come of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I painted a verbal picture of a yacht in a port on the Adriatic, the water is choppy but the yacht is doing well. On the main sail would be the words FEED and LAND. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what it came up with and it's better than anything I imagined. Really.

			<title>Doc in Berkeley in 2006</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm helping my friends at Automattic make &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt; easier to read, esp on tablets which is where I end up reading most of his writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also never liked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/02/docblogpic.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; someone put on Doc's blog. I guess if you squint it kind of looks like Doc, but that isn't how I see him.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/292425043&quot;&gt;This picture&lt;/a&gt;, which I took at a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@37.8909372,-122.2875094,3a,75y,313.36h,69.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suaMTkzX9fdF13_oSiid1mw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;breakfast place&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2006/11/08.html&quot;&gt;Nov 8, 2006&lt;/a&gt;, is much more what I think of when I think of Doc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So is it fair to use a picture that's 17 years old?

			<title>DALL-E illustrated my story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a story ten years ago, posted only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0z317zwEGJKSRcLKR8b7acQeTCf6HhA8ZJsQcnwF3rLWEoGofBuqqtrjkohMyPsUbl&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A plot for a science fiction horror movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Takes place in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A young Zuck-like hacker not only understands how to write scalable server apps, and has no principles about people's privacy (or really anything, for that matter), he's also a lawyer. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He starts a Facebook-like service, but it's better in some way (still need to come up with this element), but there's a twist. The end user agreement is customized for each user. Not for everyone, just a few.
