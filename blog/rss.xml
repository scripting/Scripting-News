			<description>Journalism talks about Trump's trials, but they are trials for the Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call&quot;&gt;he is&lt;/a&gt;) then if he isn't punished we no longer have the rule of law. So don't miss that we are on trial too. And -- when journalism frames the faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</description>

			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; was a repeat of Saturday's. The reason was the switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time&quot;&gt;Daylight Savings Time&lt;/a&gt;. This happens every year. The fix is to edit stats.json in the mail sender app's folder, and change &lt;code&gt;whenLastUpdate&lt;/code&gt; to the day before, save it, and restart the sender app. It immediately sends out the correct email. I put this note here so I might find it next time it happens and I forget how to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Oh servers!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then this happened...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been having serious problems on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt; since Friday when I made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you'd get an awful error message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors. And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they still haven't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we're going to upgrade the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That won't happen today and probably not tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people probably don't know that feedland.com is a project I'm doing with Automattic. It's running in their cloud. This system should be able to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can't, where feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are many thousands of users, we should be okay. That's why I did the work to convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but it had to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on our main server in the last few days. I can't promise it won't happen again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases re-learned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's even worse than it appears and as they say -- still diggin! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism is missing the story of the century. Does the American experiment end here? That's the horse race worth covering.</description>

The same data. There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; advantages to doing it that way. For some people that is what news.scripting.com will turn into. It's an on ramp to the world of collaborative feed subscriptions. The open social web, in feeds. Which is why we call it Feed&lt;i&gt;Land. &lt;/i&gt;You know The Land of Feeds. I like &quot;land&quot; names for products and companies. I started a company called UserLand a long time ago. I was skiing in Utah in 1989 when I decided on two names: UserLand and Frontier. I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from the Mac -- where the &lt;i&gt;Finder&lt;/i&gt; is the app you spend a lot of time in. So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and began with F. I know it's weird. It's also why FeedLand feels like a homey name to me. :-)</description>

			<description>Good morning. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest3/&quot;&gt;next tabs test&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday's test showed that tabs that switching between images is fine. The tabs never get hung up. Today's test is the same except one of the tabs is a FeedLand timeline. I want to see if somehow click events are getting lost on their way to the tabs manager.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest/&quot;&gt;next test&lt;/a&gt; for finding the conflict in my tabs code. I'm trying to isolate a problem with the tabs code I use in my blog, and in various pieces of software. Late last year, I decided to stop making new tabs systems, and to invest in a single great tabs manager. This app tests only that code. So I want to know if this works. I may add another test after a while, based on the results of this test.</description>

			<description>I got a text message from an unidentified person saying they were coming to SF soon for some event so now we could go for a nice walk on the beach. At first I wondered who this could be. I have a 415 number, but I live far away from Calif. My first thought this was a friend who didn't know I moved (in 2009 btw, must not be someone very in touch). Of course it's just phishing. D'oh. It's clever. I guess. I guess it isn't really that smart to send a message to a random 415 number and assume the person might live in the Bay Area.</description>

			<description>There's a problem on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; home page. On a mobile device, sometimes you have to click several times on a tab to get it to switch. It doesn't seem to happen in desktop browsers. Yesterday I finally got it to reproduce on my own machine, when emulating an iPad Mini in Chrome on my desktop. I added debugging code and set breakpoints, and had a theory that tooltips were interfering, which turned out not to be the case, but now that I can reproduce it here, I really want to get this solved. If you have development experience, or just like a good technical puzzle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/287#issuecomment-1983757115&quot;&gt;here's the thread&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Evan Prodromou &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@evanprodromou/post/C4OkHjlveLn&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that he has access to a feature in Threads that we don't have, which allows him to follow his Threads account from a Mastodon account. This is the easy side of interop, the other direction is more difficult, not technically, but from a regulation and PR standpoint. Facebook (they call themselves Meta now) heavily regulates what people can see on their network, and it's hard to imagine them not having an App Store like the ones on iOS and Android that allows certain services to peer with them and disallows the rest. This should be factored into people's thinking about the benefits of federating. It probably will feel fairly one-way.</description>

			<description>BTW, in case you're wondering where &quot;still diggin!&quot; came from -- here's the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it's a lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there's more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It's like &quot;even worse than it appears.&quot; Still diggin is meant to say we know it's really futile, you don't have to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we feel somehow that next time it really will work. It's a Vonnegut-like or Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other words, realistic.</description>

			<description>I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted to be a writer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker&quot;&gt;Russell Baker&lt;/a&gt;. I was quoted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; in an op-ed. I have done some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html&quot;&gt;most successful work&lt;/a&gt; of my career with the NYT. I love journalism &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;like I love the Mets&lt;/a&gt;. I don't expect them to do great things every season, but I do hope for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; every once in a while. These days I don't have much hope for the NYT returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up in Queens in the 1960s. We &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing.</description>

			<title>How we learn to art</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it any other way? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever invented just to make something new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of that in software, people won't put in an API so you have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can make progress when people don't try to lock up their ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Individuals live just a short time, we can't do that much in a lifetime, but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and we build. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/selfportrait.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We learn by studying ourselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why shouldn't our machines be able to learn too? They already can do things vastly more complex than we can. We've invented a huge lever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar Galactica. But those are stories, they didn't happen. The future is rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has come before is now in our hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/weWillUseIt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We're going to use it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote the words, ChatGPT did the images. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's been a slowdown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;, I believe it's related to a limit reached on the database server. But for now you may see it take a long time to load pages. I have a ticket open with Digital Ocean. Update: Problem fixed.</description>

			<description>If the Democrats had a sense of the moment they'd run the campaign on a plan to regain control of the House and keep the Senate and White House so we can pass a law that legalizes abortion in the whole country. Give people a positive reason to elect a governing majority. Think powerfully.</description>

			<title>Biden &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a fine president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and proto-blogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just made it a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing about Gaza is that there's the rest of the world, and they're watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been such an asshole to the US. He's a freaking MAGA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure. The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there's another path, compassion and help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But they're doing it the only way we can, given who we are.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we never have. Journos seem to think Americans can't understand the basics of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn't really any more complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We need an analogous rule that says there should be no reporting on polls until after the election, to allow the people to form their own opinions, for the same reason. Also, people are less likely to vote if they feel the outcome is a foregone conclusion. People even form their decision re who to vote for based on the polls. That's not a very healthy way for a country to govern itself.</description>

			<description>The big deal with ChatGPT is that it's a huge improvement over search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the pieces together. I don't care how it does it, it's a much higher level tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a computer.</description>

			<description>When I was a grad student in Comp Sci, I was a teaching assistant for a class in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ece252.ece.wisc.edu/ch07_inclass_01_assembly_language.pdf&quot;&gt;assembly language&lt;/a&gt; programming for a couple of years. One of my responsibilities was to grade the work of the students. Later, I was the CEO and lead developer at a software company I founded, and there I had to review other people's source code. I was pretty fussy about writing understandable code, because it was my job in both places to understand their code, and I also knew, even when I was just a TA, how important it is that your code be human-readable, not just machine-readable. I just want to say if ChatGPT were a student of mine, its code would get an A+, with thanks from the teacher for making my life easier.</description>
