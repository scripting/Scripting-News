			<description>Do you feel powerless to communicate online unless it serves the interests of the people who own the networks you post to? Why not own your own means of distribution, managed as a co-op, and only responsible to you, as a member and customer. No VC, no billionaire, no government control.</description>

Wars are easy to start, hard to end. They actually called Bush a &quot;visionary&quot; on MSNBC, they were so in awe of his courage, but that would end soon. And this time, no doubt Trump started the war with the approval of China and Russia, which will be left alone by the US in their conquest of Taiwan and Ukraine. Leaders of smaller countries must be wondering where they can hide from this. A very depressing moment.

			<description>The war in Iraq started in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/03.html&quot;&gt;March 2003&lt;/a&gt;. That was also the month I arrived in Cambridge after driving cross-country from Woodside, CA. Because I did most of my blogging on scripting.com, I still have a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/03.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of how I experienced both those things. It's also the month we got the Harvard weblogs going, but they have not stood up so well. I wouldn't have predicted then that my personal blog would survive the system we started at one of America's great universities.</description>

			<title>The web after AI</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/02/frankfurterWithSauerkraut.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I still use Google. And I like the AI response they put at the top of the page, even though I get that it's bad for the web. Maybe there's a position for a web-only search engine. One where my writing has a chance of being seen by interested parties, rather than being converted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=slurry&quot;&gt;slurry&lt;/a&gt; to be fed to consumers as one would get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/hot-dog-stand-new-york.html?sortBy=relevant&quot;&gt;tasty hot dog&lt;/a&gt; from a NYC street vendor. Another level of processing. If I recall correctly one of the browsers is saying they're not using AI at all. But this would be different, it would be for search, not the browser. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Google, if you want to be fair about it, there should be a permalink for the AI-generated answers. This is something none of the AI vendors seem to be able to do. If so, I wonder why? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just tried looking up &quot;Regular Medicare&quot; on Google, I was looking for an official page and ended up using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicare.gov/providers-services/original-medicare&quot;&gt;Medicare.gov&lt;/a&gt; one. But I could have decided the Google synopsis was the best. No way that I can see to use that as a link. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should all start thinking about how we would like the new post-AI web to work? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am trying to reach the well-known political pundits to tell them we don't have to accept the web the billionaires give us. The costs are very low, their money doesn't help them as much as you might think, because they have different concerns from the ones you (writer) and I (developer) have. I don't care about revenue (disclaimer that doesn't mean everything will be free and there won't be a business model, it just isn't the reason I'm doing the work). This is my way of giving back, the area I have the greatest leverage. I always argued that Bill Gates who kept saying in the 90s he was going to be a scrappy competitor now and give away his wealth when he retired. He &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; doing that btw, but I thought man you're never going to have the leverage you have now. Your money as a way to end famine or fight the climate crisis is nothing compared to the power you had when you had the dominant operating system in a time of great transition. You could, I argued, make the web a breakthrough for self-government, so we could &lt;i&gt;systematically&lt;/i&gt; solve those problems with the resources of the United States, not just the resources of the world's richest man. That possibility really was within reach, I believed then and still do now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;choice&lt;/a&gt; Bill didn't and it worked. We were able to build something amazing, only to see it broken down into that slurry I mentioned at the top of the page. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love AI, I don't want to go back. But I also have big plans for human thinkers and developers -- writers, using the technology we never got a chance to develop while we were busy being dominated by Larry and Sergey, Zuckerberg, the Twitter founders, et al. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3mbgv3xaah22u&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky today, we're going to insist this time that the political punditry get involved, assuming they are serious about saving what's left of our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I am trying to reach the well-known political pundits to tell them we don't have to accept the web the billionaires give us. The costs are very low, their money doesn't help them as much as you might think, because they have different concerns from the ones you (writer) and I (developer) have. I don't care about revenue (disclaimer that doesn't mean everything will be free and there won't be a business model, it just isn't the reason I'm doing the work). This is my way of giving back, the area I have the greatest leverage. I always argued that Bill Gates who kept saying in the 90s he was going to be a scrappy competitor now and give away his wealth when he retired. He &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; doing that btw, but I thought man you're never going to have the leverage you have now. Your money as a way to end famine or fight the climate crisis is nothing compared to the power you had when you had the dominant operating system in a time of great transition. You could, I argued, make the web a breakthrough for self-government, so we could &lt;i&gt;systematically&lt;/i&gt; solve those problems with the resources of the United States, not just the resources of the world's richest man. That possibility really was within reach, I believed then and still do now." created="Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:50:53 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2026/01/02/144702.html#a145053"/>

			<title>Good Old Medicare</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This year I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicare.gov/providers-services/original-medicare&quot;&gt;Original Medicare&lt;/a&gt; for 2026 after being on super duper insurance industry enhanced Medicare for the first five years. I should've known that it's super duper for them but not so great for the insured person or the taxpayer, that is -- me. They have set it up so they can scam it 18 different ways, Some of the &quot;services&quot; they offer are just ways for them to charge the government more for your care, in return for doing absolutely nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So today I had my first Regular Medicare experience. I went to renew my prescriptions, and the vendor already knew my insurance info which was impressive use of computers. I was prepared to give it the new info. And in case you're confused, you still have to pay the insurance industry for Regular Medicare, even though that's actually a deal between me and my government. No way to deal them out, though I'm sure it would make total sense for us to do exactly that. Don't believe that when it comes to health care the US has been anything like a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where the old plan each prescription cost $0, this time I actually have to pay out of pocket approx $100 for a 90 day supply of five different medications. On the other hand, I'm paying much less for this insurance. I haven't done the math yet, but it feels like I'm not getting ripped off. See how many qualifiers there are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh the great old US of A where you can give your tax money and retirement funds to insurance companies who buy politicians etc and so on. Maybe the only thing to appreciate is that we get some health care for all our tax payments over our careers? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And one good thing is now I get to keep most of my Social Security payments instead of it all going to United Healthcare. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I’m never too old to make a young developer’s mistake.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of those times when you pay the price for working past your timeout, like a pitcher pitching too many pitches in one game. There's an item on your checklist, and you'd love to take it off before you start the next session. You copy paste something, get it to work, and close out your session for the day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While you're preparing to get up you decide to share a linkblog item, and when it boots up there's something severely broken. It has nothing to do with anything on your list! You roll it up for the day anyway, figuring it'll be easy to find when you start the next session. No sir. You have to work through complicated code you haven't touched in months! Where the fuck is this, and how the fuck did it happen. Drink more coffee. Keep stepping through the code to identify when things went bad. It happens in the most impossible place. You keep digging in. Even more impossible. Unfathomable. But you keep going in, making sure every bit of code does something you think it should and then boom! You left a copy in some DOM code in something you cribbed so now there are two of this thing you hadn't touched or even looked at in months. Delete the mistake, rebuild, click off all the breakpoints. And yup that was it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started work at approx 9AM and it's 11:41AM — wasted the best part of the day, all to learn the lesson that no more &quot;one more feature&quot; before I get up bullshit. If you're tired you make mistakes, and you can't not pay for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No doubt I will continue to learn this and other lessons all through what remains of my career. Some things you never learn, like &quot;I can always roll back&quot; — but where should I roll back to? When did I break this mofo? Oy. I'm never willing to go back that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
