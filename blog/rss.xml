Instead some people are, I assume, not raised to think creatively. I was challenged intellectually by my parents from a very young age, asked to think about things that maybe most kids don't get asked about. Somehow my mind was trained to ask questions. What a perfect time it was to be born. Because along come personal computers, where you don't have to use someone else's hardware to explore. And then the web. And now AI. At this point you can't see the horizon, you don't have an idea what the limits are, but you can see some of the paths that lead beyond where you are. It's wonderful to watch people explore this. We can do that because we have the web and personal computers. See how these things build on each other? We were able to do podcasting because we had a way to spread the word through our blogs. One bootstrap leads to others.</description>

			<description>On Threads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C2kb5UkLtV0&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Every day I ask myself at least once, 'How did we do this before ChatGPT?'&quot; He's writing database queries in his prompt. It won't be long before he has an idea for how spreadsheets should work, or a writing tool, and getting ChatGPT to write it for him. It'll be ready to download before he can load the page. We just have to make sure the open protocols are there for him to build on. It's possible that's not something the bots will be able to do on their own.</description>

I have no idea if the BDG helped, but it was the only way I felt I could be supportive of the protocol, without saying it was a complete failure. I was unusual in that among the developers of the protocol, I was the only one who didn't work at a big company, so if I wanted to do something badly enough, I could just do it. The basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; was: &quot;If you want to implement SOAP in your app, this is one way to do it. And if you do, your software will interop with mine.&quot;</description>

Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn't have said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy.

But I was embarrassed that there were far more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don't admit that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.</description>

			<description>I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and that's hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won't have a response to, since you can't control or spin how old you are. We can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I just want to say that she should continue to speak.

			<source:outline text="I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and that's hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won't have a response to, since you can't control or spin how old you are. We can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening people's minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA." created="Wed, 24 Jan 2024 13:37:54 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/01/24.html#a133754"/>

It was a huge day in my life, and in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I was there that day, along with Kandes Bregman from my startup, Living Videotext. We had a full page ad in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MACWORLD-Macintosh-Magazine-Premier-February/dp/B001OI6YL6&quot;&gt;first issue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/macworld-magazine&quot;&gt;MacWorld&lt;/a&gt;. We were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our &quot;idea processor&quot; ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people at Apple who believed in us, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boich&quot;&gt;Mike Boich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Yocam&quot;&gt;Del Yocam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Campbell_(business_executive)&quot;&gt;Bill Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. I don't know if we would have made it without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn't have to find out. Thank you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software developers.</description>

If we all watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy&quot;&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt; and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards&quot;&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt; for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;recent trade&lt;/a&gt; where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career&quot;&gt;Great Hope&lt;/a&gt; of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/&quot;&gt;hotshit kid&lt;/a&gt; with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; was something else. I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel&quot;&gt;Niners and Packers&lt;/a&gt; fans were emoting in other ways at the same time.

			<source:outline text="I realize that most of the people who read this blog aren't sports fans, something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series, give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st century that we don't get any other way to imho. If we all watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy&quot;&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt; and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards&quot;&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt; for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;recent trade&lt;/a&gt; where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career&quot;&gt;Great Hope&lt;/a&gt; of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/&quot;&gt;hotshit kid&lt;/a&gt; with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; was something else. I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel&quot;&gt;Niners and Packers&lt;/a&gt; fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate." created="Sun, 21 Jan 2024 16:24:25 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/30/quickley.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/01/21.html#a162425"/>

			<title>Bull Mancuso comics bonus!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law. She's a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck's, which she gets from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3818612,-71.1198074,3a,75y,313.45h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss6IPyoxMNQaPkqRfO8TULg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;store on Mass Ave&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus. Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first, because it's closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard Law School &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/classroom.png&quot;&gt;classroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/professorMancuso1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;#1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/professorMancuso2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;#2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn't what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds you're trying to change, and know you're in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: &quot;With electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering, innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in every journey.&quot; These people understand their product and how their fans see them.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they're always there, and not too busy to help out. They know everything you don't know and need to know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a human btw). It's remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human programming partner. It's the kind of helper I aspire to be.</description>

So if you have an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven't gotten used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as it seems it can.</description>

So if you have an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com.

			<description>I imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C2K6xlTpa3q&quot;&gt;ChatGPT must have&lt;/a&gt; an interface that allows me to send it a bit of text via an API, and get back the same response I'd get if I were typing it into their web page. I am a paying user, I don't want to do any more than I'm currently doing with it. I just want to be able to keep an archive of everything I do, in a format that's more useful to me.  (Update: They do have a simple API, &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction&quot;&gt;documented here&lt;/a&gt;.)</description>

That is sick. Here's what I want. I want to go to a pro-democracy event, where we do things like register to vote, and offer community service to each other. We need to belong to something great, not to study the degradation of our country. We also should use our communication systems to spread not only positive messages, but to position Hitler as the ultimate loser. We have to present the counter-argument, in a way that still has a chance of getting through. And I still want us to celebrate the symbols of our fight for freedom, which obviously never ends. That's why I'm wearing a MLK button, in real life and &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/15/blogscreenshot.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;on my blog&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to exist. It's possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they would arrange things this way. Just-in-time species reboot.</description>
