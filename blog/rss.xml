That's how we're doing it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for Brent's account on Bluesky, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It's too good an opportunity to pass up.</description>

			<description>One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account to feed we do with sites that support &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html&quot;&gt;feed discovery&lt;/a&gt;. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for Bluesky. I expect we'll do that for FeedLand via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;FeedHunter package&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>The last episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png&quot;&gt;Oh The Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

It was good. But this isn't a movie review, it's a review of the user interface for choosing movies on streaming services. Why can't we integrate a site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://metacritic.com/&quot;&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt; with Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Max, AppleTV, et al. Just let me know what Metacritic says, and make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I want more info. Don't make me look it up. People joke about how we spend our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it's true, I do it. Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online. How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of the links generated by their CMS are broken.)</description>

He's a great talker and story-teller and philosopher, and a great human being. I had never heard him interviewed before, or read anything written by him, but I watched all his TV shows in the 70s. The people in them were people from my neighborhood, but funnier. Why should it be surprising that the stories this man told in real life were the same ones he told in his scripts. Now I want to find more interviews with him. Great stuff.</description>

			<description>No matter how hard we try, no matter how much we want to make a difference, for most of us, all the difference we make happens when we're alive, there is no lasting value to our existence after we're gone.

			<description>I'm starting to scope out if it would be possible to create an Electron version of FeedLand. I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/e825efea-c271-4c24-8594-01a03c21f3af&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT about that. We did not arrive at a plan. FeedLand uses MySQL, I can't convert to another SQL, we have to use the same codebase in all versions. If, after reading the chat, you have ideas, please post a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/282&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Disneyland on the internet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/111591319022264255&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trying to wrap my head around the idea of Facebook in the Fediverse. This is a company that strives to deliver Disneyland on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who cares if a node blocks them, what's really going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVF4kebiks4&amp;t=50s&quot;&gt;bake your noodle&lt;/a&gt; is when they run access to the fediverse like Apple manages their App Store. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that is how it's going to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're also going to implement Facebook-only APIs, and you're going to want to support them, because they give you access to many millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might be better for the Fediverse if they're just bluffing, but don't be so sure you're going to like the way it works once they're fully in (if they ever are).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/16/threads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;How ChatGPT visualized Threads as I described it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/07/140505.html&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, I'm beggin you -- get those RSS 2.0 feeds in there asap, and hook up with Mastodon now. Let's go. It'll be so much fun and give people all they want without putting Facebook in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>You're supposed to know</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you all know, I was a math major in college. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the weirdest choice for me because, until my first semester of college, not been interested in math. I thought it was boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out math &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; boring, the teachers were boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a math professor in freshman year, at Lehman College, in the Bronx, who showed me first that I could do it, and then led me to the discovery that hey this is amazing. So I majored in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't do great, B-minus average. But there was one class I got an A in, a summer class (in New Orleans), and it was the only class I took. I think that made a big difference, I could just focus on this one subject. My mind has always been like that, I like to zoom in on things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I remember one day, almost 50 years ago, the professor was standing in front of the class, fuming, angry. We had all turned in proofs that didn't work and that included grad students, he pointed out (I was an undergrad). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He said this: &quot;You're supposed to know when you've proven it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Might be the most important thing I learned from all the math. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not math if your proof doesn't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years later I'm a grad student in Computer Science, and a teaching assistant for a class in assembly language. First semester I was learning it along with the students, although I had already had a class in assembly, you don't really learn it until you teach it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I promised to post example code on the door of my office for students to copy if they needed help on an assignment. I did. When I got back, one of my office mates, whose name I remember to this day, was, like my math prof at Tulane, fuming, this time at me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She said this -- you have to run your code before you post it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was fire coming out of her eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was right. I was shamed. And obviously never forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same story really. A proof that doesn't work isn't math. And code that doesn't run isn't software.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>So, with the &quot;Bloggers&quot; category not yet ready for prime time, I've replaced it with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=all&quot;&gt;All category&lt;/a&gt; from FeedLand, changing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/14/newstab.png&quot;&gt;title to News&lt;/a&gt;. I know it's confusing. I think there's going to be a fair amount of this kind of shuffling in the weeks and months ahead, as we try to fit news and blogs together in interesting ways. You can read the Bloggers category on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, even with &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; no longer on the home page of scripting.com, it still gets more hits than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;. There's something there to look at. I want to do more to integrate the blog and the news. To make some kind of new publication that has a bunch of voices, yet doesn't spin out of control.</description>

I started watching the new one, and all of a sudden the two princes, William and Harry, are actual people. I have a lot of trouble with that, because of course I remember when they were born. However I'm pretty sure I'll go all the way through. There are a lot of hours of entertainment in The Crown and a few scenes that are truly spectacular (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;). I remember the really good ones of course, but there's an awful lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schlock&quot;&gt;schlock&lt;/a&gt;. One scene I had not remembered was a pretty good illustration of how fucked up people can be. Princess Diana had just gone on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqe-SuyAyWI&quot;&gt;tour of NYC&lt;/a&gt;, her first international tour on her own, and it was (surprising to her) a huge success. Another British invasion. The people of NYC loved Diana (at least in the show, I don't remember this, I was living in California at the time). So she comes home, and the royal family, instead of cheering her, were angry with her for being so charming. Go figure. Her husband, Prince Charles is yelling at her and he asks her if she ever considered how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla&quot;&gt;Camilla&lt;/a&gt;, Charles' one true love, would feel about Diana being so popular. Diana is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gobsmacked&quot;&gt;gobsmacked&lt;/a&gt; (as am I). Why would she think of that. How totally fucked up is that. Why should anyone, being themselves, being happy, worry about how anyone else might feel about their happiness? I've been in Diana's position a few times, achieving success, much deserved, and was reminded that this upset people who (apparently) didn't want me to succeed? I have even been asked that question. If you ever feel that way, that someone else's happiness is meant to make you feel bad, remember Carl Sagan's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; video. Really, &lt;i&gt;no one cares&lt;/i&gt; if you are offended by someone else's happiness. Remember, none of this stuff amounts to anything in the big picture. We're very small, all of us put together, in the grand scheme of things. So if you're happy, good for you! And one other question -- is re-bingeing actually a word?? &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: 0.6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I addressed the How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write. I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love my writing. Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We weren't very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440&quot;&gt;hear from them&lt;/a&gt;, and that's especially lovely.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I addressed the How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write. I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love my writing. Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We weren't very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440&quot;&gt;hear from them&lt;/a&gt;, and that's especially lovely." created="Thu, 14 Dec 2023 21:58:03 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/14.html#a215803"/>

We have to think more broadly. What are the benefits we want from interop in social media. Federation isn't itself a benefit. It's an idea hatched by techies who aren't thinking about how people actually use these systems and which features are valued and which are problematic. Imho, what's valued is the ability to publish something quickly, and without much fuss, and follow others, again easily without having to have a deep understanding of how these things are architected. No one but us programming plumbers cares. I think the idea of &lt;i&gt;conversation&lt;/i&gt; not only is overrated, but it's where all the problems are, where all the abuse happens. If we focus on the benefits, quick dissemination of news, and the power of the individual to choose their sources and share them with others -- that's where the juice is.

Along the way he wondered how I find something to write every day. The answer -- I don't find things to write, it doesn't work that way. I don't sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write 1000 words and it doesn't matter what it's about. If I have something to say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say, because I'm always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get there. A lot of trial and error, let's see if this way of putting it works, or that one, etc. There's a slogan for this -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html&quot;&gt;Narrate Your Work&lt;/a&gt; -- and my work is narratable and creates its own record because I do my work right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it. And if I can get the people I need to listen to me, ie read my blog, then we can work together (a recurring theme) to make great communication systems out of the web and avoid flushing our future down the toilet, which we always seem to be doing.</description>

			<description>Another time I blog about is when I figure something out that I've been trying to understand for a long time, in some cases my whole life. That still happens. The other day I found myself talking with a friend about love, why when someone says &quot;I love you&quot; it doesn't mean what it seems to. Love comes from understanding someone well enough that you know what they desire, what they ache to have, and you to try to help them get it. See all the qualifications in that. Try. Help. Them. In other words, you can love someone when you know them. And you don't give them what they want, you help them get it. You can't love someone who your whole idea of is based on a dream you have about them. That's different. Anyway, lots more to say about all this. It's a recurring topic. It might be the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; topic. Someday they'll invent an AI that can analyze my writing and tell me if I've ever written for any other purpose than being worthy of love.</description>

In Frontier the database and the language are the same thing. And because Frontier did the rational thing with synchronization, it was handled in the kernel, the code you write doesn't have to worry about it, you can write reasonably readable code. In Node it's a real chore to come back to some code you worked on last a while back. Makes my mind tired, but I do it, because it's where I work now.</description>

			<description>Starting in September or so I start thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many people care, but it's a good thing for me to do -- to review what makes a blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me -- obviously. We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved. People think &quot;well it's just me and I don't matter&quot; -- which is totally true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least &lt;i&gt;they'll&lt;/i&gt; know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value, which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last year I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915&quot;&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; Heather Cox Richardson, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack site&lt;/a&gt; is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different times, and if I'm up and in the mood, I'll spend a few minutes with HCR and it's always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.</description>

And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy things for them to write about! We're not doing that. It started out well, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.&quot;&gt;Woman's March on January 20, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but that was it. We can and must keep showing up, and I'm not advocating huge marches, I want to see neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk (if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music, food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not against something but &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; all of us. All we have to do is figure out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our democracy would be in the best shape it's been in probably since inception. I had another idea that's worth considering. We should all wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a photo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;Martin Luther King&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but it didn't catch on. If we all did, it's omission would be noticed, and we'd know there's someone we should talk with about America and offer them a free button, nicely, if they'll put it on right now.

			<source:outline text="Before moving on to this year's BOTY, I thought HCR could help figure out how we could move past merely reporting on Trump's danger to democracy, something that was clear going back to 2015, the news could start reporting on The Resistance, what we're doing to prevent the end of democracy. And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy things for them to write about! We're not doing that. It started out well, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.&quot;&gt;Woman's March on January 20, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but that was it. We can and must keep showing up, and I'm not advocating huge marches, I want to see neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk (if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music, food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not against something but &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; all of us. All we have to do is figure out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our democracy would be in the best shape it's been in probably since inception. I had another idea that's worth considering. We should all wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a photo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;Martin Luther King&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but it didn't catch on. If we all did, it's omission would be noticed, and we'd know there's someone we should talk with about America and offer them a free button, nicely, if they'll put it on right now. Anyway, I'm putting this out there again, and I'll keep doing it." created="Mon, 11 Dec 2023 13:59:26 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/06/17/mlkButton.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/11.html#a135926"/>

			<description>There's an interesting recent development in the world of feeds and blogs -- blogs that are only feeds. Designed to be read in feed readers of all sizes and shapes. I have a few of these myself. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; for example. Also, FeedLand provides an outbound &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?myfeed&quot;&gt;feed to every user&lt;/a&gt;, which meets all the qualifications of a feed-only blog.</description>

If we want independent writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I can refer back to it. I really don't have a good way yet to find stuff I've written. It's all there on the web, for crying out loud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very little of that. It's amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by other developers. This is a huge problem, it's why we've always been dominated by big companies who don't care about what we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start with a search engine for bloggers. I'll help. And let's do lots of them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>General note</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for some reason I don't find out about the work until it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there's a reason -- I want to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course I'll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How we got here</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you through that. Now that it works on phones, I can see how nice it is to be able to skim the news while you're out and about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you're working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been some huge ones this year. The product's identity system had to be replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/&quot;&gt;Automattic VIP server&lt;/a&gt; required fairly large pieces of the software to be rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There's a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime environment doesn't include local storage. Everything has to be stored in a database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; we had to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with this product. And one more thing, let's get this mofo working on mobile devices as it was meant to, which turned out to be not as hard as I imagined, and very nice to have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new version of the software with all the new code turned on is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt;. That's the version that's running on Automattic's servers, and should be able to scale to far more users. The docs aren't converted yet, but the software is basically the same. You should read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of the docs, at least, so you aren't surprised to find out that your subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product, it's more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see what would happen if instead of building something complicated around conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see where we could go with that. That's what FeedLand is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I can't believe how fast Automattic's system is. I don't understand how it does all that work in so little time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The menus are different on the mobile version, by necessity. I included the Bookmarks menu, it's really important to have the news you want to read available one click away in mobile. I imagine doing setup on your home computer, with links you'll use when you're using the mobile version. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/10/feedlandScreen1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The mobile-ready &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is ready to use.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

So if you're using FeedLand on a phone, sometime in the next 24-48 hours you may see a significant improvement. I will of course write a blog post about it with screen shots when it does become available.</description>

This is where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt; came from. Some days Olbermann really nails it, this was one of those episodes, left me wanting more. This may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Impeached-President-Andrew-Johnson-Lincolns/dp/1416547509&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, I'm still looking for suggestions.

Some days Olbermann really nails it, this was one of those episodes, left me wanting more. This may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Impeached-President-Andrew-Johnson-Lincolns/dp/1416547509&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, I'm still looking for suggestions.

			<description>How I know Twitter was great. When something was going on anywhere, any kind of thing, I'd go to Twitter and it happened there 14 minutes ago. It was the pulse of the news. And somehow they couldn't figure out how to make a business of that! Amazing.</description>

I think Facebook's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads service&lt;/a&gt; is poised to replace Twitter in this role, once they add an API that allows pubs to post links to their stories on their service. We will, in a few weeks or months, wish we had proactively formed a non-Facebook news service, a place where by convention we know we can get links to the hot stories as they become available. I think Bluesky is the perfect place to go for this now, but it would require the company behind the service to work with news orgs and independent software developers to quickly build the network. It's possible. They already have the API, we just need to do a little marketing. It's even possible without the help of Bluesky itself, if a few leaders from the news industry got involved, either individuals like Jay Rosen, Emily Bell or Jeff Jarvis, or Richard Gingras who leads news at Google (who thankfully doesn't have a horse in this race) or a big news org or two, acting proactively against turning this valuable space over to a much untrusted big tech company like Facebook. (I don't call them Meta, I think that was a con to give them cover for exactly a move like this, who would ever trust Facebook with such power after what happened in the 2016 election, but &lt;i&gt;Meta&lt;/i&gt; is just confusing enough.)</description>

A fair price imho. I advertised I'd be willing to pay $5 to read all the articles in the special issue about the second Trump presidency. Driving one hour round trip raises the price considerably. 2. A couple of readers wrote to say that the full text of the Atlantic is available in their RSS 2.0 feed. I knew that, but that isn't the issue. It's very generous of The Atlantic to offer their publication that way, but I'm not looking for a free ride, just a fair deal. I might want to subscribe to The Atlantic, what better way to offer it than on a piece-price basis. I might end up paying more than the subscription price. If I was doing that regularly you bet I'd subscribe. 3. I really dislike the term &quot;micropayments.&quot; It's disrespectful of the customer's money, and businesses that do that don't deserve our patronage. When you add up the per-article expense of great pubs like The New Yorker or The Atlantic there would be nothing micro about the money I'd spend. It's the commitment I want to avoid. Magazines are notoriously difficult to unsub from. I'd rather pay more and stay anonymous to them. Anyway, as always thanks to my readers who always offer up good food for thought! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Grandma and the cat</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd like a drawing of a sewing room with a perplexed grandma looking at a cat who was playing with balls of yarn and spools of threads, all unwound. The grandma is tangled up in the threads. The cat is smiling, mischievously as if she planned to entangle grandma like this!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/09/grandmaAndTheCat.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Margaret the cat and grandma in the sewing room.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Goldberg said they are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/797774d7-4770-46b8-863d-b7c62da4261c&quot;&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, they're journalists. Well then my question is what good are you exactly and why are you using up all the airtime? Why is NPR even bothering to interview you. He said it clearly, he was just trying to save his conscience for after the Nazis came to power in the US. We have bigger issues than Jeffrey Goldberg's conscience. Why doesn't NPR and The Atlantic go out and find The Freaking Resistance and introduce us to them. My grandfather said something to me when I was a little boy, with such clarity, I can never forget it. He said David, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you need to go up on the roof with a gun, and shoot them. He knew. He didn't say &quot;David, run&quot; or &quot;David, write an article in The Atlantic so you have a clear conscience.&quot; He said I should fight. With guns. That was the lesson he learned from his experience. So where is our Resistance? What the F are we waiting for?</description>
