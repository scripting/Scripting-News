			<description>If the state of journalism is so bad from a business side, and if it's not serving the people very well, I wonder if we could work out some kind of deal here?</description>

			<description>If we want even a modest reboot of blogging, as a community thing, we're going to have to start with something like blogrolls. I wrote a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/28.html#a154126&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; about how blogrolls came about, then weblogs.com and how that led to RSS and feed readers. This time, we don't have to wait for feeds to show up, they're already here. It should happen more quickly.</description>

But they totally behave like a blogging community. I remember when I was starting &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000621103057/http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to get an idea of when sites were updating, so I didn't have to go hunting through a blogroll, clicking on links to find out if there was anything new. So I wrote a script that worked off a list of blogs, read each one in turn, and compared it with the last version we read, and if there was a change, it would move it to the top of the list. I didn't just make it for myself, I shared it with everyone. There was a mail list where people were freaking out about this. The server that would read their blog every so often was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subhonker&quot;&gt;subhonker&lt;/a&gt;. This was something new and they were scared. I couldn't show them the benefit until the script had been running for a while. Everyone got upset. I remember being confused and scared, but I guess from their point of view it looked scary. I don't know. In the end weblogs.com became really popular, it became the central place to find out what's new with blogs, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20010123225500/http://weblogs.com/stories/&quot;&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt; to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; so we could find changes in even more detail. I guess the thing is people should see the benefit before they see the price? And as an innovator, we have to be aware of this, people may not see the benefit until they can &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it.</description>

			<description>I'm waiting for someone to give me the tools to index my own content so ChatGPT knows about it. I want it to learn my codebase so I can ask it questions about places I've used a feature before. I want to write code in a very high level language I invent as I go and have it compile it to JavaScript. Come on, what's holding things up. This will be the ultimate productivity software. The first one who gets there owns the world or at least deserves a nice prize and our thanks.</description>

			<description>I use Safari on my iPad. The software just updated, and they widened the width of icons in the browser chrome. This knocked three of my links over into the menu, out of easy reach. Why did they feel they could change something so basic? After using the iPad for 14 freaking years, why shake up this tiny little corner of the system? What's the possible benefit. Or maybe this is just a bug and they'll fix it? This is the kind of thing that makes me put off updating. Yeah I know it sounds small, but I really use my freaking iPad. It isn't just for watching movies. I can't tell you how many iPads I've bought. It's ridiculous. Come on Apple, I'm a customer not a slave.</description>

Biden is a Democrat, and Netanyahu is a MAGA. Remember that. They are not friends, and Biden has dropped very explicit hints that he's thinking that way. So give him an excuse to kick Netanyahu in the ass, and he'll be happy to do it. But he can't openly threaten Israel now, not with Trump over there saying he'd cut NATO, and thanks to him we're ditching Ukraine, even though Trump isn't in office. All of our alliances are fragile now, and getting worse every time Trump says or does something awful. Biden has to take it steady. I listened to the interviews with advocates for uncommitted, and no one even remotely suggested they'll vote for Trump or a Republican. This is democracy. It's good. That's as American as it gets.</description>

			<description>Another way to think about it. What if, say in California or New York, 15% of the Democrats voted uncommitted to make sure Biden knows he's expected to stand up strong for reproductive rights. That helps clear the way with any Democrats who feel they should go slowly. Voters expressing their political strength. Again, that's pure democracy. It's the best.</description>

			<description>In the 80s there was a tech press that reviewed software, and explained OSes and hardware, so you really had a good idea what was going on. They just don't do that anymore. Haven't for many years. But along comes ChatGPT and I can get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/e8b8e861-4345-45c4-a5bb-8e5b7432b240&quot;&gt;comparitive review&lt;/a&gt; of hosting services that compete with Digital Ocean, just by asking for it. I wanted to get an idea of how easy it would be to create an open source app so it could be easily deployed, on any of them and what the pros and cons were. I asked for a comparison between Digital Ocean (where I host my servers now) and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and I threw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, just to anchor the whole thing simplicity-wise. Even InfoWorld wouldn't have done such an in-depth review. This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity&quot;&gt;productivity&lt;/a&gt; revolution, at least.</description>

She has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kara+swisher+burn+book&amp;hvadid=673834124081&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=4553868743109009067&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2231804831244&amp;hydadcr=22122_13323353&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_1th6nk73pi_b&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; coming out. I think she's popular with other journalists. Her theme appears to be that it's the personalities that matter, not what the companies do. I don't think she has a whole lot of insight into the products and technology. For some reason tech, which mystifies a lot of history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her.</description>

She has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kara+swisher+burn+book&amp;hvadid=673834124081&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvrand=4553868743109009067&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2231804831244&amp;hydadcr=22122_13323353&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_1th6nk73pi_b&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; coming out. I think she's popular with other journalists. Her theme appears to be that it's the personalities that matter, not what the companies do. I don't think she has a whole lot of insight into the products and technology. For some reason tech, which mystifies a lot of history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her." created="Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:45:37 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/27/burnbook.png" imageLink="https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Book-Tech-Love-Story/dp/B0CFYPHG5Z/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3A5HZAPQIQFN8&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FM8cBCpWVjk-hhWnwzpLlX0FMjTZPzKAoZCVc70s5piiJcGsYN7gIJYoFxVwo_4v0KHWDRlnMsEaF51rlZN16HeQKQMc4sW4J056RoRAXZT32fFR-c5UJ-4DqGA5dfnesjv2jr2CHTAoQwcR9r43FN43u9_5-gF_fmdDysqBV10WWx5CZ5yn3GManiF5uyQQrq4RX1ZecFx71TZJQPWulhU7jlhI5L1i7KZt2ckiiLeXV9zdCQ3sWXZBjyQb74URk6ltIZS9gZR0AuLOrM4VVI203z1ufKePtL3RPWzbs8E.wF9wf4LkD-HHDyWm9SSu_j9cDqNW_4bCxHA-p9izwIY&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=burn+book&amp;qid=1709038706&amp;sprefix=burn+book%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-2" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/27.html#a124537"/>

Is he listening to what Trump is saying these days? I didn't want to ask him. These are our Nazis. They've hated us their whole lives. Until now, I never knew they existed. And now they get to parade around in public with these obscene hats on. When will the swastikas start appearing on the hats. I wonder if this is the first of many.

I meant literally what I said. &lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; writing. Not that I was using ChatGPT to do my writing for me. I can understand that some people do that, writing isn't one of their things. However writing is one of my things. I've been writing every day for almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;thirty years&lt;/a&gt;. My writing style has changed a lot over the years. I don't necessarily think it's gotten better, it's just different. I would never post writing publicly written by a anyone other than me without saying it was. Writing for me is very personal. On the other hand, I don't draw very well, never have. I used to be good at box diagrams with arrows, but I'm really out of practice. So if you see something colorful here, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; drawn by a bot, unless it says otherwise. I think we all have to be very clear about that. Now, I do write a lot in ChatGPT because I'm trying to get it to help me solve problems, almost always technical. Basically you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/b4235922-c4e2-4996-89cf-48c34cf2af67&quot;&gt;sketch&lt;/a&gt; out the problem in English very specifically so it gives you back what you want. I never thought I'd be programming in English, but here I am doing it. I really want a copy of everything I write, because someday I might want to feed it into a bot other than ChatGPT. There's the lock-in. &lt;i&gt;They own part of me, and I don't even get a copy. &lt;/i&gt;Yes yes I know I can download individual conversations, but not if they include an image btw, did you think of that? And who has time to remember to download them. This is fucked up. One of my action items is to hook &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; up to their API so I'm not relying on their editor. Every time you find yourself typing into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt; the alarms should go off.</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0&quot;&gt;Beatles song&lt;/a&gt;, by John Lennon, that was written by cribbing promotional items from a 19th-century &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite!#Background&quot;&gt;circus poster&lt;/a&gt;. It's kind of like asking ChatGPT to give you some random phrases and presenting that as your creativity. I think I'm going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/4aafde35-2903-48e3-88c0-bcd8725ac702&quot;&gt;try that now&lt;/a&gt;. I asked ChatGPT to write a poem using ideas from a random song written by John Lennon. It chose Imagine. I asked that it write a poem using the ideas in Day Tripper. And finally I asked it to write a song based on the story of The Matrix.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I came up with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/22.html#a031907&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; for Joe Biden's presidential campaign -- Old Enough to Know Better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to draw a campaign rally with a banner that said that, but it wouldn't do it for Joe Biden, so I changed the name to Bull Mancuso, and had him run for governor of Calif instead of president of the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It still couldn't spell the banner correctly but it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; pretty inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/23/campaignAdForBiden.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The banner should read &quot;Old Enough to Know Better.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

How there's good and bad that come with getting on, and Repubs (of course) have been focusing on the bad but the journalists aren't getting the other side. One thing is for sure, it's hard to put one over on someone who's been in politics at the highest level for as long as President Joe has been. That's what the &quot;know better&quot; part is about. Whatever you can say about him, he knows a lot about being president. I've been using this motto as my own tagline for a while. But in the interest of protecting our democracy, I think the president should use it for his re-election campaign. No charge. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Another Beatles post</title>

Not the other Beatles, they all make sense to me. Sometimes they have longer hair or a beard or whatever, but it's still the same face as before. Also I have trouble figuring out which Beatle is singing sometimes. On some songs it's perfectly obvious, others I have no clue. For example Norwegian Wood, Come Together, Strawberry Fields and Lucy in the Sky, that's John of course. Right? Hey Jude, that's clearly Paul, as is Let it Be, Yesterday. But for years I didn't know who sang Lady Madonna. Martha My Dear? Paul could sing so many different kinds of music. John, not so much. I guess. I'm still pretty unsure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ChatGPT designed a civilization</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What I asked for: Imagine a version of The Sims or SimCity that had ChatGPT integrated,. You could create whole civilizations and then explore them, and if there was something you didn't like, you could have your way. No rule of law for you! You are the law. I wonder if you could draw me a Sims-like community as ChatGPT would design it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/22/simsGPTCity.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&quot;Here's a visual representation of a vibrant, utopian community as imagined with the integration of ChatGPT's design principles. This community blends futuristic architecture harmoniously with nature, featuring energy-efficient homes, community centers, and public spaces all connected by pedestrian pathways and lush gardens. Solar panels and wind turbines integrate seamlessly into the buildings, and the central plaza acts as a hub for gatherings, surrounded by parks, sports fields, and a lake for water activities. This illustration embodies an ideal balance between technology and nature, promoting health, well-being, and environmental stewardship.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I don't care if you're at a BigCo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't care if you work at a big company or are an individual developer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I care if you can make a contribution toward interop on the open web.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've found over the years that sometimes devs at bigco's can help enormously (eg microsoft, netscape, automattic) but more often they are harmful (apple, ibm, sun, google stand out as the worst). Sometimes companies play both roles (apple).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But i also know that bigco's because they are big, have lots of different ideas how the world should work. And that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter's big competitive advantage</title>

Re-posted here with minimal editing. The fact that I could write it on Twitter was the point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has one advantage over all the other social webs. no character limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started typing a post on Threads which has a large character limit compared to the others, but ran out of space and decided to write it over here in twitter instead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;yes they charge me $8 a month for it, but it's worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;we have to get used to the idea of paying for value, it's how we avoid the messes of the last 20 years. esp if we can make sure we retain copies of everything we write (guaranteed by using our own writing tools, btw) which is another requirement for the new blogosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;btw, i'm having a blast these days. it's like tinkerbell in peter pan. all the open web needed was people to believe it exists for it to come (back) into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;still diggin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ps: i also like they have simple styling, but where are the freaking links, twitter. do I have to pay another $8 to get those??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;pps: the worst character limit is bluesky, i can't write anything there. too bad, it's a really nice system otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ppps: it would be nice to give something like this a title so you don't have to read pgf after pgf to try to figure out where i'm going and if you're interested. so i gave it a title, using markdown syntax. maybe they could just support markdown. hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;pppps: i asked chatgpt to draw an illustration. that light in the middle of the room is the open social web. it's a vision of self-reliance, empowerment and cooperation. I asked for the light to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell&quot;&gt;tinkerbell&lt;/a&gt;, but i guess they were concerned the image might belong to someone. creeping shitification. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/22/tinkerbellAndKids.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;This is not a picture of Tinkerbell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I think I understand why journalism can't get there.

Do we want to let Republicans enslave women, 1/2 half the populace, or do we want to return to the way things were before Dobbs. I don't have to explain. Very few people on the fence here. What we need are people directly affected by this situation, women of childbearing age, and let them speak, over and over, every day, about all the ways their lives are turned upside down by the direction the Repubs are taking us. No longer &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to take us. There isn't much to argue about here, it's fairly black and white and it is a real division, not one of the bullshit devisions the Repubs have been able to trick the journalists to focus on.</description>

			<title>Are there any gutsy NYT op-ed columnists?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Certainly &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the NYT columnists must have noticed that the management is playing a dangerous game with our election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When are they going to write a column raising the question of how non-transparent the process is, and how dangerous it has become. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Might take a bit of courage to do that, and being willing to put your career on the line, for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just asking the question, even if they fired you, seems as big an issue as the question raised by the special prosecutor re Biden's age?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been a columnist for a somewhat major publication myself, and I promise you, if I were witnessing what's going on at the NYT, I'd submit the column, and if they didn't run it, I'd offer it to their competitors, and if they wouldn't take it, I'd run it publicly on a blog, and say that they wouldn't run it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can't really witness something like this without speaking up. They gave you the platform, you should use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Feed cleaning</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm doing a feed cleanup, unsubbing from broken feeds, and ones that haven't updated since last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are some people and orgs whose feeds no longer update who I miss.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that's great about ChatGPT is they can help you make a decision in an area you lack expertise and where there is no human you can ask for help making the decision.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/293&quot;&gt;Random thought&lt;/a&gt; -- maybe the fastest way to get full ActivityPub support for WordPress is to offer a feature in any WP site to cross-post to a Mastodon gateway operated by Automattic. It's possible I don't understand the problem of course. But Mastodon is open source, so it's not like depending on another vendor to do this for you. And then you avoid all the hassles with having to say what part of the protocol is ActivityPub and what part is Mastodon's API.</description>

			<title>I look forward to dumping Trump again</title>

I read today in the NYT that the resistance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;is exhausted&lt;/a&gt;. Bullshit. We're very well rested. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist, next year or the year after, Murphy-willing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other day when I was skiing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belleayre.com/&quot;&gt;Belleayre&lt;/a&gt;, I got to ride up on a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it wasn't a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but they deserve to live too. He said he didn't get vaccinated, he doesn't like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath. I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured appendix at 9 years old. I also said you're really lucky not to have needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to myself but didn't say out loud that what about your parents and grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real anger, but -- you also can't walk away from the other person. There's a lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/19/whatMagaReallymeans.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;What Trump means by making America great.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I posted the ChatGPT &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/16/174119.html&quot;&gt;explainer&lt;/a&gt; for blogrolls, but realized later there was an important use of blogrolls it didn't mention. I kept a blogroll on my home page because those were the sites I wanted to check regularly to see what's new. So I was thinking about my own use of my blog, not just helping out sites I support or giving ideas to people who read my blog. Also they didn't provide an illustration of what a blogroll looks like. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815061940/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; from August 2000, and sure enough, in the left margin, there's the blogroll. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/17/blogrollScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
