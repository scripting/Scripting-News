			<description>Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to Raptors. He wasn't the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them. He has a competitive grace you don't see very often. Quickley was one of those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team, he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side, if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks win they way they are winning now. That's what I want from developing software. I want to create a global team of truly independent developers, filling the void left by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation&quot;&gt;predation&lt;/a&gt; of the silos. There won't even be a business model for much of what we do, but there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We're going to play a game we started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can't produce end-user software much longer, but I don't want to leave until we have this thing rebooted.</description>

			<description>I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://politics.newsriver.org/&quot;&gt;politics.newsriver.org&lt;/a&gt; working again. Things got pretty shaky in news product land. I'm trying to figure out a general formula for getting things working again.  And as I update them, I'm switching them over to HTTPS. Once again I have to put in a plug for &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;. A real time-saver.</description>

			<description>When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties, because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate. Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it's a good question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.</description>

The thing that's great about this moment is that people are just beginning to get the possibility of not being locked into silos. They don't know how to parse my posts and screen shots, because I can do something they never thought they'd be permitted to do. Well we've got some visionary and lovable techies at Masto and Blueski who want you and I to be able to do that. And we've been building on that. And will continue to do so, Murphy-willing.</description>

			<description>Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features. Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.</description>

I once thought I could make server products or toolkits for people I called &quot;poets&quot; -- motivated writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results, I've seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; technical to work. If they knew what was required, my 2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/07/012112.html&quot;&gt;Julia Child&lt;/a&gt;, a hero of mine, believed she could teach anyone to be a good-enough cook.

I was pretty sure when I took my second guess, but that's just when the cursing started.  By the third guess I thought she's screwing with us! I should not have listened to the podcast.</description>

I was pretty sure when I took my second guess, but that's just when the cursing started.  By the third guess I thought she's screwing with us!

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112111808903353870&quot;&gt;On Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;: I've done this before, starting 25 years ago. Find some new connection I can make because someone was wise enough to add an RSS interface. I get to have an &lt;i&gt;aha!&lt;/i&gt; moment and a good laugh at how great this is and then write a freaking blog post about it, and people think man this web thing is pretty cool.</description>

Not to see some cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/thispageisnottherehahahah&quot;&gt;404 page&lt;/a&gt; (although it is pretty nice).

			<description>Saying the web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social&quot;&gt;misses&lt;/a&gt; Google Reader is like saying the United States misses President Trump. Why do I think that? Think of the mess Google left behind when they dumped the web. Putting all our cards in one basket in software is a very very very very bad idea. As everyone who misses The Orange Feed Reader is evidence of. It's like someone rips you off bad and all you can think about is how much you miss them. You, sir or madam, need to get your head examined.</description>

			<title>The big picture</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As I complete a big project I like to re-center, to remind myself what I'm working for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My goal is to create a &lt;i&gt;social web&lt;/i&gt; that includes blogs and twitter-like systems. To set a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;baseline&lt;/a&gt; where titles, simple styling, links, enclosures and the ability to edit are tools writers can use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Somehow twitter pushed writing into a tiny little box. If we work together we can dig ourselves out of this box. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is a nit, but it bugs me anyway. I'd love to know why Threads, which in every way is a modern JavaScript app running in a web browser, uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/exampleOfAThreadsUrl.png&quot;&gt;urls that begin with www&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Did you forget that quickly?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We've noted this before.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Established facts about Trump eventually lose their currency, reporters forget and report it as big news next time they see it happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fealty&quot;&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; to Putin for example. How could a reporter forget that?

			<title>Four things about threads.net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Four things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're selling ourselves out by letting Facebook own a new social network and not putting that energy into building something that preserves our choice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I understand that Facebook's claims of supporting the Fedisphere won't amount to anything. They will end up controlling what interop means, which means we end up with yet another app store, with all the nonsense that comes with. Welcome to CyberDisneyland.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You know all this, as well as I do. But we have decided not to care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly how we snookered ourselves into using Twitter for 17 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a screen shot of the new software that came out today, the blogroll feature on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2024/03/13/more-updates-from.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton's blog&lt;/a&gt;, viewed in the blogroll on my site, talking about stuff on my site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As we used to say in the Old School Blogosphere: &quot;Watching them watch us, watch them watching us, etc, etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/expandedBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Manton's blog is expanded, revealing the five most recent posts. The cursor points at one, showing the full text in a tool tip. Click the link to visit the post on his blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/itGetsEvenWeirder.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Shortly after posting this item, Scripting News showed as the top item in the blogroll.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/docShowsUp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Then Doc Searls posted on his blog, and I had to snap a screen shot. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Doc &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/blogroll&quot;&gt;coined the term&lt;/a&gt; blogroll? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/gruberFireball.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Then Gruber showed up from &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;. It's a bit like a party. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today was a very exciting day here, I think tomorrow will be too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/corectblogroil.png&quot;&gt;This image&lt;/a&gt; was the result of a late night collaboration with ChatGPT. For some reason it can't spell anything right, and when I asked it to correct the spelling it mocked me. But I loved the design. It understood the hard part of what I was asking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks have been slumping since two of their top players have been out with injuries for over a month, after having an amazing January. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; of the two star players came back last night, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39718456/og-anunoby-lifts-knicks-blowout-win-76ers-return&quot;&gt;what a difference&lt;/a&gt;! They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson&quot;&gt;one player&lt;/a&gt;, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab&quot;&gt;second injured player&lt;/a&gt; comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html&quot;&gt;MacWrite and MacPaint&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.</description>
