			<description>In 2014 I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/09/28/myManifestoForWebWriting.html&quot;&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; about web writing. A decade later later, I'm still trying to get writing on the web to work again. It was on a good track before &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/10/05/180457.html&quot;&gt;the rude interruption&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Before we were so rudely interrupted</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Before%20we%20were%20so%20rudely%20interrupted%22&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; this phrase a few times recently: &quot;Before we were so rudely interrupted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or, &quot;the big interruption.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Twitter&quot;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, when web writing was downgraded, to be 140 characters with no styling, no links, without the ability to edit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's when writing on the web started going in the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when I say it again I may link to this post, because out here on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/scripting/manila/bloggerCon/ruleoflinks.html&quot;&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt; is always allowed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I was surprised the one I liked best was the VW. It handled well, the others were sloppy, drive like the big cars they are. The Rivian had the best computer system, looked even nicer at first look than the Tesla. The Kia EV9 had a standard Kia computer system, far behind that of Rivian or Tesla. VW's computer was halfway between, it appeared they thought overall about the controls, but I was so impressed by the ride, and size, and the whole concept of it, and I always liked vans. I'm seriously thinking about swapping my Tesla for the VW. There are other disadvantages, I'm going to start reading up on it, until today I never gave it any thought, didn't think it would be a car for me. But I &lt;i&gt;realllly&lt;/i&gt; liked it.</description>

			<description>People are surprised that I'm trying to build the for-real social web as opposed to the aspirational social web. It &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; require a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt;. I feel that. Sometimes I put off doing things because while the coding is simple and straightforward, the immensity of it overwhelms me a bit. I don't remember feeling that way the first time around, possibly because we were doing it all step by step over approx ten years. Now it's all compressed into weeks. I know how to do it, and I've got or built the pieces I needed. But it just doesn't somehow feel right that the idea is actually becoming a thing. &quot;This can't be happening.&quot; But we live in that kind of time. Who knows what monsters lie within. We may find out. Heh. Maybe that's where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/68dfd79b-ab24-8012-86b6-d7941c09f02a&quot;&gt;goosebumps&lt;/a&gt; come from.</description>

			<description>With the advent of AI code development tools, maybe we should embark on a project to merge all programming languages into one syntax. To undo all the chaos and make humans more competitive with machines. The fact that there are so many development bubbles is a huge waste of resources. Makes us all net-net more stupid.</description>

			<title>Should tech run the world?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;With all respect to the tech industry -- why is the traffic in the Bay Area so awful. Why haven't they done anything about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't that be a good test before running the whole world? As programmer myself, I wouldn't trust the algorithm without a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance&quot;&gt;QA&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously. Think about it&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the strangest configuration for a metropolitan area, the center of the city is in the middle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/03/bayAreaMap.png&quot;&gt;the bay&lt;/a&gt;. (Same as Seattle, btw.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best answer the tech industry came up with was Uber, as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lived in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Menlo Park, Berkeley, Los Gatos and Woodside over 31 years and I did nothing to fix the problem either. My answer was to move to NYC where the transit system is pretty great. Then I moved to the mountains and got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tesla&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, the idea that the stars of Silicon Valley should run the world is not new. I first heard about it from Apple top level managers in the 1980s. They were not techno-fascists, but they did hugely underestimate what it takes to run the world, or even a small country in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/10/02.html#a131238&quot;&gt;preserving freedom&lt;/a&gt; by using replaceable parts to form a social web out of the web itself. Outside the silos. I'm getting comments on it. Nice to see other people thinking likewise. That's what we need to get a bootstrap going. People. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words &lt;i&gt;the social web is the web. &lt;/i&gt;It's made of people. Somehow we forgot that, and gave up so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking I might have coined &quot;let the web be the web&quot; as an obvious ripoff of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9-3NxTzQ8&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; slogan for the new President Bartlet. But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22let+the+web+be+the+web%22&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; reveals that it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; used, but all in very good ways, so that's cool. However a &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%22let%20the%20web%20be%20the%20web%22&amp;date=now%201-d&amp;geo=US&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Trends search&lt;/a&gt; shows up nothing.

			<description>I have a problem in the development version of WordLand. Sometimes when I bring it to the front, there's an error deep in jQuery, an event has fired and the handler is pointing to a string or number, not a function. It dies, with no stack crawl, because it was responding to a focus event or blur or something like that. Something got overwritten. I have no idea where or how it happened, but once found it will be obvious. I've been trying to figure it out with Claude and ChatGPT and I can see it's going to take a few hours of concentration and learning to figure it out. But then I realized hey -- I bet I could use the Chrome debugger to find this problem. It has Gemini built in. It has access to the running code. I don't have to act as an intermediary, gathering data, pasting stuff into the AI bot. Now I'm looking forward to doing this.</description>

When you use the web instead of a silo you are helping build community outside, where free speech is the default. The more of us who communicate outside, the more people will be attracted. Your participation helps draw people out, where independent developers can create new tools for you without waiting for permission of big companies who own the network you're using. It's like voting. The more people do it, the stronger we all are. I've spent the last 31 years insisting on that freedom for myself as a writer and developer and sharing it with others. As people flocked to Twitter and Facebook, etc, you thought I was gone, finished, a loser. I know they think that about me. But honestly, I also knew the open internet would come back, because I knew its value, and I knew eventually the silos would reveal their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/500716650/donald-trump-clinches-the-presidency-in-major-upset&quot;&gt;real cost&lt;/a&gt;. They may appear free, but there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_salute_controversy&quot;&gt;price to pay&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you'll consider using the tools. If you want to get started, create a free site on wordpress.com. Just create it. That will be your home on the open social web. And btw, you don't have to agree with my politics to be part of it. That's kind of the whole point. ;-)</description>

			<title>I have a very large head.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Normal hats don't fit. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I buy my caps from &lt;a href=&quot;http://BigHatStore.com/&quot;&gt;BigHatStore.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In prep for my trip to Ottawa later this month for WordCamp Canada, my first trip out of the country in a long time, I wanted to get a new hat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They don't have a big selection of NBA hats, so there's no Knicks hat that fits my head.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they didn't have any Mets hats for some reason. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought -- I'll get a Wisconsin hat! I went to grad school in Madison and loved it there. You know Fuck em Bucky! But they didn't have any Wisconsin hats either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was dejected, but noticed they &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; have Harvard hats. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I got one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me of a joke a famous VC told when we were walking around on the Stanford campus in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It goes like this...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How can you tell someone went to Harvard?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pause.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I give up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They tell you!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Haha. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or they wear a Harvard baseball cap.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to tell that joke a few times, while wearing the cap. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It’s true. They could get Repubs in Congress to fund Obamacare, but Trump could ignore it. That’s reality. What do the pundits think they should do?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the unvarnished truth.

That was possibly one of the first digital selfies.</description>

			<description>I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://palfreylaw.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; to hold some of the essays &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt; posts on Facebook, where they are out of reach of the tools of the open web. John is a longtime friend, for over 20 years, and we did some &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=palfrey&quot;&gt;great stuff&lt;/a&gt; together in the early days of the blogosphere. I will happily turn the site over to JP any time he wants, and provide personal support if there are problems. I want him in my online web family, and Facebook simply does not make that possible. It's a silo, as we know and that means it's basically a world unto itself. If we want to solve the problems of the world, we have to step out into the open space where what we write is not so local or controlled.</description>

			<title>Frum's dilemma</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Listening to today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/10/the-david-frum-show-sam-harris/684424/&quot;&gt;David Frum podcast&lt;/a&gt;, from a journalist who says he reps the facts-only brand of journalism. He says his guest invented podcasting in 2014, about 14 years after we started it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He then says that anyone in tech in the late 1990s made hundreds of millions of dollars. I didn't make very much money on those terms in the 90s, but I did a lot of the creating in that period. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both of which tell you more about who he pays attention to than anything resembling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the first thing journalism can do is let up on the arrogance, they represent their own point of view and nothing more. Humility.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Regardless I find that Frum is worth listening too, because he asks questions that are worth thinking about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In today's podcast he asks if the Dems ever get control of government, should they use the new norms to punish the Repubs who so damaged our system. He says it's a tough question, I say he's made it unnecessarily complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same people are also breaking laws that are on the books. Let the reconstituted DoJ do their jobs. And if there's one thing I'd insist on, they get an AG who doesn't dream a lot about how everyone means well, and they kick off the prosecutions immediately on taking office. And if the courts have been corrupted, then you have to deal with Frum's Dilemma, but not until then.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course I'm not one of the people he can hear, but if you're one of the people he does listen to could you send this his way. Thanks! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We like Twitter. So blogging must be dead.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation with Dan Knauss from the WordCamp Canada team. He said that people in the WordPress world don't think of it as a blogging community. I can see why they resist that, blogging has gotten a lot of bad PR in the last 19 years. The same bad PR that RSS got, and I felt that was so wrong, as wrong as what people said about blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We like Twitter. So blogging must be dead. I understand -- I get it. But that's marketing, and only necessary because Twitter wouldn't let blogging be part of what they did. I'd be happy to talk about that during my keynote if people want to hear why I think that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway until 2017 I tried to fit in between the silos. 2017 is when I realized it was hopeless. I couldn't write for the web and for the silos at the same time, I had to choose, so I went with the web. Instant happiness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so you don't emphasize blogging in the WordPress community. This imho is a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even if it was a community built around a style of sneakers or audio equipment I would say it's a mistake not to build a custom blogosphere just for the community. In the past we would have used Twitter for this, but I don't think anyone in their right mind wants to try to do that now. Esp a community, like WordPress, that has open web built into its bones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of time to write this morning, so let me leave you with this story. It took years to boot up blogging as a community. I thought everyone would want to do it as soon as they saw what it was, but there needed to be a critical mass before there could be a critical mass. Logically impossible, right, but somehow it happened anyway. But slowly, in fits and starts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But podcasting, in contrast, happened much more quickly. The reason? We already had blogging to build on. We had a way to communicate without the press in the middle. That's the power of blogging. We build our own news system. Do things the journalists don't understand or are counter to conventional wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So imho it's only coincidence that WordPress happens to be a great blogging tool. It can be that and all the other things it is. It's going to be something else too, if I have my way -- it's going to define the basic software that powers the social web. Not peripheral, but central. That and RSS. Incredibly powerful combination, and I think ready to be a strong alternative to the silos. In order for that to work, we have to reboot the blogosphere, so we will do that. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Cross-posted from &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/we-like-twitter-so-blogging-must-be-dead/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Canada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
