			<description>Could Kamala Harris look into the camera tomorrow night and say &quot;To Fox News viewers, they've been feeding you a load crap. Just thought you should know. And I wouldn't trust the others so much either.&quot;</description>

			<title>30th anniversary in a month</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the value in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to a reunion at Berkman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html&quot;&gt;after 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn't do it every year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;But I have a feeling there's a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I was writing for Wired). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;started blogging&lt;/a&gt; and believe me the icons of the Valley for the most part &lt;i&gt;did not like it.&lt;/i&gt; They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases. But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be buried, and I wrote about it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Woz&lt;/a&gt; liked it. I was popular at the parties, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen&quot;&gt;Heidi Roizen&lt;/a&gt; once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement (the one where Steve came back). There weren't many people there, maybe 20 or 25. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121&quot;&gt;upcoming book&lt;/a&gt; that I'm like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig&quot;&gt;Zelig&lt;/a&gt; of tech. This is what he meant, imho. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from tomorrow. You won't hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably won't hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special in mind myself. Hopefully it'll come together in the next month, or sooner. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to 1994, by looking to the future. You won't need an invite, btw. It'll open to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Peering in the social web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A very practical issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k&quot;&gt;BlueSky&lt;/a&gt; has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I cross-post to, namely:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads: 500&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS: no specific limit&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;WordPress: no specific limit&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BlueSky: 300&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This will be a problem when we eventually get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering&quot;&gt;peering&lt;/a&gt; working cross-network among twitter-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to start, although I don't think ultimately there should be any specific limits. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send messages across these boundaries, but wouldn't handle the engagement features, likes, replies, forwarding. It's what many people are starting to do now, by hand. There's no way to put it off, imho -- the Bluesky limit is already hard to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Do you think you've ever had an online chat with an AI impersonating a human without you knowing? Have you had such an experience with someone you know? If no, when do you think you will have such a conversation? Would you mind if a friend used an AI to front for them, so they could do other things while they were &quot;chatting&quot; with you? Would you be liable for anything your avatar did or said?</description>

			<description>It's a fascinating moment, somewhat like when the Berlin Wall came down. When it happened, we were all in kind of a daze. That wall had been there my entire life. No one knew, for many years, what its disappearance would mean. Same with the wall betw the Democratic and Republican parties. It was still the same US when one or the other was in power, there were constants that didn't change. There was an agreement that politics ends at the border. But now, are there two parties? What became of the one we call Republican?</description>

It was amazingly easy to move the data from the old phone to the new one. Just turn both on near each other, and click a couple of dialogs. Haven't used it for anything yet.

			<title>Why journalism doesn't come back</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a difference betw journalism in 2023 and 2024, it really is changing that quickly. They are a mechanism for delivering some really tragic lies now, without correction, and a lot of people will believe them. Esp the two Trump is pushing now about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2024/trump-abortion-roe-wade-overturned/&quot;&gt;Roe v Wade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-keeps-saying-some-states-allow-the-execution-of-babies-after-birth-they-dont-heres-how-that-falsehood-got-started-201129756.html&quot;&gt;Democratic states killing live babies&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't a fumbling Trump, the words were written for him, he's rehearsed them, they're powerful lies, and journalism is carrying it. When they comment, it's far away from the lie. They'll let him on again and again to lie. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first time they carried his lies we could excuse it, but not the 50th. They invited him to speak on their air to transmit lies. Transmitting lies is the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; of what news does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That means all the idealism we see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/04.html#a153237&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; was for nothing, we now know how it ended. I don't think this has caught up with most people yet, and it's not something the journalists are going to report on, so realization may come slowly -- but it happened nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We'd be fools if we believe anything that comes from channels that broadcast lies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what's so sad about The Newsroom. Their thesis was that an always-striving-to-be-true journalism that goes to jail to protect sources, the Woodward Bernstein, Edward R Murrow, amazing American news, what we were told we grew up with, probably wasn't even remotely true in 2011 when it was broadcast, and any pretense of it covering the truth in 2024, is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A program like The Newsroom has a new context, it's no longer a light feel-good comedy, today it's a tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've never written a review on Amazon even though I shop there regularly. I was about to write a negative review for a product they can't seem to support, that I depend on, but got &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/05/amazonReviewPage.png&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt;. Weird. I bought the product from the page I wanted to review it on. How else would they determine if I actually purchased the product? They don't say. They do offer to tell me a joke if I rate products I've bought. I've heard the company isn't doing that well now that Bezos has stepped aside. Hopefully this is just a bad set of coincidences.</description>

			<description>I'm watching the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; from 2012, it's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin&quot;&gt;Aaron Sorkin&lt;/a&gt; show. It's fairly insipid, but for some reason I keep watching. They have a multi-episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Newsroom_episodes#Season_2_(2013)&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; as they go crazy trying to source a rumor they've heard that the US bombed a town in the Middle East with sarin gas, and killed a lot of people. In other words they committed a war crime. Turns out they were set up by multiple people, and they went through all kinds of angst over who should resign and who should be fired, and how they would ever regain the trust of the viewers. It is a Sorkin thing so it is by definition overdone, but in the context of today's NYT and CNN and all the other schlock &quot;news&quot; that reports Trump's ever-more-egrious lies not only without fact checking, but knowing for sure the lies are coming. That this has happened to American &quot;journalism&quot; is worse than a war crime. It's what everyone told us is an essential part of an authoritarian state, we expect everything in the news to be lies. We have now gotten there. It's good to acknowledge that, imho and stop asking why it is, rather think about &lt;i&gt;what you can do&lt;/i&gt; about it.</description>

It's rare in things like this that you can point to a moment, but we can &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the record should make that very clear. You could say Hammersley was the first to publish the term in a piece he wrote, but he played no role in the bootstrap. I'd say that by the end of 2004 it was on its way, I basically stepped back and enjoyed the medium along with everyone else. Adam started a company. I would have liked to have started a company then, but it wasn't meant to be. That all happened 20 years ago.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/09.html&quot;&gt;September 2004&lt;/a&gt; was the month when podcasting became a real community thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html&quot;&gt;Twenty years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;podcasting got its name&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them &quot;audio blog posts&quot; or some variant thereof. You can see it in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; graph. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;special feed&lt;/a&gt; to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;Apple's podcast&lt;/a&gt; database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. &lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<title>Bluesky vs Mastodon as open APIs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Neither one is in a particularly strong position. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like &quot;fediverse&quot; get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working &lt;i&gt;together. &lt;/i&gt;It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:34:08 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a133408"/>
				<source:outline text="I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:34:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a133423"/>
				<source:outline text="Neither one is in a particularly strong position." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:34:57 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a133457"/>
				<source:outline text="Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:48:48 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a134848"/>
				<source:outline text="Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:38:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a133810"/>
				<source:outline text="As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like &quot;fediverse&quot; get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch)." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:50:24 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a135024"/>
				<source:outline text="I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working &lt;i&gt;together. &lt;/i&gt;It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies." created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:41:06 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/02/133332.html#a134106"/>

Put up a screen that explains why he was cut off, then go to commercial, esp during the debate on Sep 10.</description>

They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a &quot;market of one&quot; and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder, I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the success of the company.</description>

			<description>Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook&quot;&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>And for some companies, the founder of a company they acquire might make the best CEO when the founder of the original company isn't available. Again Apple is a great example. Steve Jobs ultimately replaced Gil Amelio, after Apple bought NeXT.</description>
