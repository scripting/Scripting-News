			<description>BTW, straight -- everything Kara Swisher claims to be, the insider with the best view of the industry, they got that wrong. The things that matter happen far away from her conferences and dinners. It's as if Silicon Valley were Hollywood. To some people it is. But the big changes are never recognized by those people until they're juggernauts. They don't make the changes. They soak them up and devour them. They best of the people she writes about are not creators, they're pirates.</description>

			<title>On Tesla, Nazis, X and the Macintosh of cars</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'd buy a Tesla today because of Musk's politics which he puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of people dying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who developed it, who I don't know. I hope they're not Nazis. I don't see how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the year I bought mine, could be anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be hard for me to do. I don't think my &quot;support&quot; of Tesla could mean that much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car (one of its innovations). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It's like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even if I wasn't one of Apple's top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs didn't design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did. Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial. That's a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don't want these products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those are some of the brightest people out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I'm looking at other company's EVs with lust. I might like a Kia or a BMW. If you're making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/&quot;&gt;Ben Wurdmuller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/2024/i-tried-tesla-fsd&quot;&gt;posted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I've had much the same feeling about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html&quot;&gt;FSD&lt;/a&gt;. This piece started out to be about FSD, but the preamble, like the one in his piece, got so long I decided to post it first as its own piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Something disturbing about America in 2024. Over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/&quot;&gt;million&lt;/a&gt; Americans died of Covid, but they aren’t on our minds. A million more have long Covid, perhaps. This suggests a million Americans could be killed by our government in the name of a conspiracy, and we’d shrug it off like good Germans. “We didn’t know,” a likely defense.</description>

			<title>How my workday flows</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;On Bluesky, Andrew Hickey &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the chaos. It wasn't until the work was over that I was able to start to get back into my flow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a good five or six hours before it's time to do the next thing.  The first hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about where I'm going next. By hour two, I'm not quite at my highest rate but getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I'm in a good groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I'm taking short breaks to check email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my attention to be available, for a short period.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After 5-6 hours of this, I'm wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my head. It doesn't take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole thing, and basically have to start over the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I'm sure of it. Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual achievement. If you're doing something that few other people do well, you're not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and a lot of detail, and memory, but you're sometimes inventing things that no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other. And you're doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you're burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they don't interfere at all. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won't edit it until the evening, when I do lite work that doesn't require much focus for any duration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Different kinds of networks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and tries out new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;With ActivityPub you know who's following you and in RSS you don't. This may sound like a negative until you think about it from the user's standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn't like RSS btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind of spooky but I guess ok. I can't recall ever receiving spam as a result of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I unsub begging me to come back. So it isn't a huge problem in a real way at least for me, yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You're just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don't abide that. Have a nice day.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sometimes it pays to start over</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think you can save time by starting over sometimes, and rebuild the complexity, carefully testing at every step. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Going back and fixing a poorly tested corner-turn, esp one you did a while ago, is a time-consuming and frustrating process. You need to have a fully consistent model to evolve. When you try to reorganize a complicated bit of code, and you find yourself scratching your head about how this or that works, that's a sign that it &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it's much more fun to add new features to a broken foundation than it is to either fix the foundation or rip it out and put in a new one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yes we're having an eclipse next week. Earthquakes often find other kinds of energy to feed on, like the one during Game 2 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Bridge_Series&quot;&gt;Bay Bridge series&lt;/a&gt; between the As and Giants in 1989. The Bay Area doesn't really get baseball. You have to pick sides. You can't root for both teams. So an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_World_Series#The_Loma_Prieta_earthquake&quot;&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; knocked out the Bay Bridge and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html&quot;&gt;screwed up&lt;/a&gt; the Bay Area for quite some time to come.</description>

Spectrum’s other ways of providing support are designed to get you to give up without using too much of their employees' time. On Twitter, they pretty much always stay with it to resolution. And on Twitter, they have real people who have access to network tools, so they can see the problem from their end, and can give you a clue of what if anything you can do to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty good at bug reports, and that appears to work with the online support people they have on Twitter. If you try to chat with them or call them on the phone they read from a script which has you completely tear down and rebuild your system before they'll consider thinking about the data you have. And all this after keeping you on hold listening to their insidious advertising for 15 or more minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think the other twitter-like systems have any critical mass with support people from ISPs. Not like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, support is one place ChatGPT would excel, btw. All kinds. And I don't think too many people will lose their jobs, because their support systems are so bad because they don't hire enough people, or give them enough time with customers, or training, to actually help them very much. I know how to completely tear down the network without them instructing me how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Understanding AP and RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What does ActivityPub does that RSS doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, it's not the ability to syndicate, RSS already does that. I can follow anyone on any server. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it's the timeline? And the ability to delete posts. Keeping all that in sync is a lot of work, and presumably a lot of traffic? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also replies. If I reply to a post when viewing it on another server, the reply should show up under any other view of that post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What else??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Only thinking about features that are used by Mastodon to federate, not potential future features. If that were the rule, then RSS could do anything AP could do, right -- because you can always add the feature. So, just the features that are in use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I posted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112213481032208332&quot;&gt;on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; and may post it elsewhere, if I do I'll link them in here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I want all the information</title>

Until ChatGPT, that was a totally unattainable dream. But now, for many topics, it's reality. For example, if I have a question about CSS, and believe me, I do -- if I can ask the question clearly enough, I can get a clear and complete explanation of why the browser did the crazy thing with layout that it did. It means I could do something beautiful and refined like the blogroll I worked on in February and March, and the UI stuff I'm working on in March and April. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't wait until ChatGPT can answer all those questions about my stuff. But then people who make music don't want their songs to be available the same way. As someone who wants to know as much as possible about songs I have always loved but had no idea how they were made, or what they meant to the writer, knowledge about the work is equally valuable as understanding technical topics. I think the big difference is knowing that life is short, and if we want to leave something behind of ourselves, having the information be available is a blessing, not something to fight against. I don't see why software designers in the future should have to reinvent what my generation has already figured out. I don't want them to have to. It keeps coming back to this one idea -- to solve the problems we have as a species we're going to have to &lt;i&gt;work together, &lt;/i&gt;and part of that means not being so guarded and selfish about sharing what we've learned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had this problem with music before, with Napster. The users of music, such as myself, found that the ability to program our own music was so liberating. To listen to a song a few times before moving on made a huge difference, or to choose a song to hear because we just thought of it for the first time in 30 years. But we were literally mocked by music promoters and artists. But ultimately, like it or not, the users got the power they wanted. It's got to happen that way too for ChatGPT et al. I guess some people must've felt that search engines were going to rob creative people of control of their creations. I guess this is something we always have to go through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The blogroll code includes the CSS for the Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a localized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/a&gt; of Bootstrap's styles, to be a better guest in other people's pages. That is now done. I expect we'll see more of that kind of thing. Web plugins are a new area for me. I guess that's pretty obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A new women’s march for reproductive health would be a great place to start. I'm not giving up on journalism yet, just knowing they need to see a resistance to report on it. That means big marches, streets filled with Americans, who will sound angry and determined when interviewed by reporters. And spokespersons who can be interviewed by Maddow and Blitzer.</description>

Let's not argue about what the press should cover. We can't change them. Just give them what they need to do the right thing.</description>

			<description>After a couple of tests, the fix below is implemented here. For some reason I wasn't subscribed to my own feed, which accounted for the fact that updates from this blog weren't getting into the blogroll. That troubles me, I have to try to piece together how that happened. In the meantime it's nice to have the instant updating working again. I didn't know that I had missed it, but I did.</description>

Probably the sexiest feature in the whole thing. The bug was introduced on March 21, so it's been there a while. You have to hard-reload the page to get the new version. So, when I post this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, it should move to the top of the list immediately. So a good use-case is to leave Scripting News open with the blogroll visible and every once in a while you may find something interesting to read. I like having it there, but of course, it's my baby, so that's understandable. :-)</description>

			<description>I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to one of Kara Swisher's interviews for her new book. The interviewer was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods weren't fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another podcast. She's got a great business model. Tell the press what they want to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.</description>

			<description>Started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/01/scriptingOutlineScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;new outline&lt;/a&gt; for the month of April, with March &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml&quot;&gt;safely archived&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. If you want to read the month in outline form, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drummer.land/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml&quot;&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; and it will open read-only in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. That's a pretty good approximation of how I edit it, except I use the desktop version of Drummer that writes files to the local Mac filesystem as well as to the cloud.</description>
