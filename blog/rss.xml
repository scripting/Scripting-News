But there's a whole class of podcasts that I am prepared to love that do it just plain wrong. Current example: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pluribus-the-official-podcast/id1846198705&quot;&gt;official podcast&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Pluribus&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt;. Previous example: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-severance-podcast-with-ben-stiller-adam-scott/id1788381175&quot;&gt;official podcast&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Severance&quot;&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt;. The reason: It's a bunch of people laughing about how funny they are and how they are the best in the world at what they do. Or some seriously unfunny thing that happened or almost happened on the set. If a friend told you these stories you'd roll your eyes and ask them kindly then desperately to just move along please. They never criticize. Today I listened to the NYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sunday-special-the-best-tv-of-2025/id1200361736?i=1000742188278&quot;&gt;best-of 2025 in TV podcast&lt;/a&gt; by their critics, and it was imho exactly the way the official podcasts of hit shows should be. There has to be at least a possibility that they will say something critical, or funny irreverant even inconsiderate things, and not are not 100% self-promotion. The Pluribus podcast is just not interesing. Which is stupid because Pluribus is a very interesting series. I can't imagine too many people listen to the podcast, but then I can't imagine why lots of people do lots of things.</description>

			<description>BTW. Why video &quot;podcasts&quot; will never replace audio-only podcasts. Two reasons. 1. There are places where your eyes aren't available to watch a video, like when you're driving a car. 2. Listening to audio only is different from both audio and video. Audio forces your mind to fill in the blanks, which taps into the listener's creativity. No way to say one is better than the other, but they are different. I watch plenty of video, at home or on a train, but I also like to listen to podcasts when I'm walking or driving, riding in a bus or subway, or waiting in line somewhere.</description>

I asked how did you figure out that's what I came here to ask about?? It gave me an exact technical reason. If we keep going this way soon we're going to wonder at the human hubris to think we could develop systems that could in any way equal the systems it can develop.

Sorry if I’m telling you something you don’t already know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we can't help but be judgmental. It's programmed into our DNA at a deep level. You have to form an instant opinion of other animals, any delay could cost your life. Better to assume the worst. Fight or flight. This happens esp if you don't know you're doing it, so don't know to watch for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't until their 40s that most people understand that what they see isn't what everyone else sees. If you think there's an objective truth that we all experience, you're not getting the point. There is no consistent &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22view%20from%20nowhere%22&quot;&gt;view from nowhere&lt;/a&gt; because everyone is &lt;i&gt;somewhere.&lt;/i&gt; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know where I was when I really understood this, not because I read it somewhere, or a teacher told me about it. I was riding on the 4 train north in the Bronx, where the train runs as an elevated on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jag9889/3195371318&quot;&gt;Jerome Ave&lt;/a&gt;. I had ridden this train for three years as a high school student, and never thought about all the six story apartment buildings whose backs faced the train. As you went by, you passed by one family for every two or three windows. A whole set of people with relationships, problems, tragedy, joy, dreams, the whole thing. They don't come from where you come from, inside each house there are stories, lives, people. You'll probably never know anything about any of them. I wasn't sad about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/20/viewFrom4TrainBronx.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;View from the 4 train described above.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid we went to a bungalow colony in upstate NY, around where I live now. I was less than 10 years old, so were my friends. We used to do things together that the adults didn't know about. There was an abandoned house we used to hang out in, mostly open to the elements. We also played in a graveyard and talked about what the families whose names were on the headstones were doing. Having dinner maybe? Listening to the Mets on the radio? (No TV in the mountains.) So the thought had occurred to us at that point in life that behind doors there were things happening that we could only imagine. I guess what you learn later is that you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; imagine, and if you want to know you have to ask and listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I saw a critique of my writing that said I don't put enough titles in my writing. I didn't want to answer it in context, because I wanted to explain more generally. I tried to write the way the world was forcing me to write for over ten years, between 2006 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, and I came to hate it. My writing is a way of getting things out of my head and into a place where I can find it later. It's more interesting to me if it's published. I am vision-impaired too. But if you account for every preference, as I learned between 2006 and 2017, the writing ends up worse than worthless. It becomes something you have to overcome. In the end you have write about why this is the wrong way to write. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You have to form an instant opinion of other animals, any delay could cost your life. Better to assume the worst. Fight or flight. This happens esp if you don't know you're doing it, so don't know to watch for it.&#10;&#10;It isn't until their 40s that most people understand that what they see isn't what everyone else sees. If you think there's an objective truth that we all experience, you're not getting the point. There is no consistent [view from nowhere](https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22view%20from%20nowhere%22) because everyone is _somewhere._ ;-)&#10;&#10;I know where I was when I really understood this, not because I read it somewhere, or a teacher told me about it. I was riding on the 4 train north in the Bronx, where the train runs as an elevated on [Jerome Ave](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jag9889/3195371318). I had ridden this train for three years as a high school student, and never thought about all the six story apartment buildings whose backs faced the train. As you went by, you passed by one family for every two or three windows. A whole set of people with relationships, problems, tragedy, joy, dreams, the whole thing. They don't come from where you come from, inside each house there are stories, lives, people. You'll probably never know anything about any of them. I wasn't sad about this.&#10;&#10;![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/20/viewFrom4TrainBronx.png)&#10;&#10;View from the 4 train described above.&#10;&#10;When I was a kid we went to a bungalow colony in upstate NY, around where I live now. I was less than 10 years old, so were my friends. We used to do things together that the adults didn't know about. There was an abandoned house we used to hang out in, mostly open to the elements. We also played in a graveyard and talked about what the families whose names were on the headstones were doing. Having dinner maybe? Listening to the Mets on the radio? (No TV in the mountains.) So the thought had occurred to us at that point in life that behind doors there were things happening that we could only imagine. I guess what you learn later is that you _can't_ imagine, and if you want to know you have to ask and listen.&#10;&#10;I saw a critique of my writing that said I don't put enough titles in my writing. I didn't want to answer it in context, because I wanted to explain more generally. I tried to write the way the world was forcing me to write for over ten years, between 2006 and [2017](http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html), and I came to hate it.

			<description>I usually only drink iced coffee, even if it's cold outside, but lately I've been craving a single cup of &lt;i&gt;hot&lt;/i&gt; coffee esp when a basketball game is about to come on. I'm one of those old guys who falls asleep watching their favorite team &lt;a href=&quot;https://sny.tv/articles/knicks-tyler-kolek-pacers-career-game-preparation&quot;&gt;kick NBA ass&lt;/a&gt;. So anyway I decided to treat myself to one of those fancy new-fangled Keurig &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cuisinart.com/soho-single-serve-coffee-maker/SS-7TR.html?srsltid=AfmBOorxELmhJGWcs7VBSRrE1fkga0Ke5BaIvAL9pyH3r2dolCnix858&quot;&gt;single-cup coffee makers&lt;/a&gt;. I'm drinking my first cup. Works as advertised. Took a few tries before it woke up. I am now drinking a fresh cup of hot coffee and thinking now I finally have everything I could possibly ever want.</description>

The book I'm speaking of is the one where it's all about Carol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere she goes people stop and say hello, and address her by her name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hi Carol! &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Congrats Carol! &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Carol, we will move heaven and earth to make you happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You suck Carol !!!!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the book she ends up changing them back, un-joining them, and they keep the good qualities they got from being joined, and can be individually creative as they were before the switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, btw -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena&quot;&gt;John Cena&lt;/a&gt; says their situation isn't sustainable, but neither is the one we are in now ourselves, in reality, in our reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She teaches her lover, Zosia, to think in the first person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Carol is right about everything because this is her book. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see it happening on her whiteboard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The show could be titled The Adventures of Carol, as told by Carol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/19/youSuckCarol.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;BTW, I might love a podcast of just the writers of the show every week, perhaps interviewed by writers who did not write it, asking questions. It might suck as much as the one they do now, but it also might be great. It would stick to the story, not about praising everyone, kind of like interviews of sports heroes (which are mostly nauseating, except for the few have the gift of gab, who are fun while never saying anything remotely bad about anyone). The people they'd talk about are the people &lt;i&gt;they created. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Inoreader and dynamic OPML</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This post was updated thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/348#issuecomment-3672110696&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; from Andrew Shell. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a free account at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inoreader.com/&quot;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;. I was reminded today that they support dynamic OPML subscription lists, and decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inoreader.com/opml_subscriptions&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to an OPML subscription list. Exactly the same format we used for importing lists. This means I can use the same feed list in two readers. Or I could share my list with everyone who subscribes to my newsletter. I can update the list, and the flow of news to the subscribers changes too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried subscribing to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=podcasts&quot;&gt;podcast list&lt;/a&gt; in Inoreader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put the URL to my podcast list on the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inoreader.com/opml_subscriptions&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on the Inoreader site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click the big blue Subscribe to OPML button. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Paste the URL from the first step into the dialog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Enter a folder name and description. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For synchronization I recommend the second option, full synchronization. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then click Save, and if it worked, you should see the OPML file in a list. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/18/inoreaderList.png&quot;&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt;. I now can see my podcast updates in Inoreader, exactly as if it was in FeedLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when I add new feeds they show up over there, same when I remove. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It'll be very interesting to see how it changes over time. I'll let you know! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Links&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcasting/&quot;&gt;Listening lists&lt;/a&gt;, as a feature for podcasts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opml.org/&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; I was accumulating short URLs for subscription lists.

I am pretty sure I know exactly what would get the ball rolling now, upgrading the web platform so users can buy their own storage and let software tools access it. So we can have all kinds of editors working on Markdown text, without the developer having to become a reseller of storage, and without limiting its use to people can figure out how to create an S3 bucket, and map a domain to it, etc. Dropbox came close to doing this about a decade ago, but backed out. This is why development is so centralized around big silos. I've been an independent developer on the web for over 30 years, and before that 15 years on desktop computers before that.

			<source:outline text="If a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kingcons.io/posts/make-me-ceo-of-mozilla.html&quot;&gt;CEO of Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; took an oath to restore the web to its former greatness, they would find a lot of business models open to them. Instead, they’re trying to be part of the tech industry which places no value on the web being a place for open development. I am pretty sure I know exactly what would get the ball rolling now, upgrading the web platform so users can buy their own storage and let software tools access it. So we can have all kinds of editors working on Markdown text, without the developer having to become a reseller of storage, and without limiting its use to people can figure out how to create an S3 bucket, and map a domain to it, etc. Dropbox came close to doing this about a decade ago, but backed out.

			<title>Humans have an exclusive on being human</title>

It's something that my Android phone does every so often, when I haven't said the magic word that activates it, even if I'm not in the same room as the device. It's a tiny bit funny, but a reminder that the microphone is always on, so I watch what I say when walking around the house, knowing that whatever I say is likely to end up in a database, to be used against me in a court of law. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't like that it was a voice of a British woman. It was not a friendly voice, perhaps intended to communicate intelligence, competence. An unwelcome intrusion into reality, but then it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; reality -- I'm getting old, and won't be here that much longer, and odds are that the British-voiced female robot will outlive me, forgetting for a moment that it is not actually alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would submit this to the NYT as a guest op-ed, except I haven't explained why we must not create cyber-humans out of AI bits. I'm open-minded. Perhaps this is the way to create a new humanity, one that can survive the hell that's coming due to climate change. One that won't mind being subject to an idiotic 21st century American emulation of Adolf Hitler (incorporating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/12/17/trumpChiefOfStaffPress.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt; about Trump). One that only needs electricity to survive, and won't need the medicine and love and attention that flesh and blood humans require. But every time I address the robot as I would address a real human, I try to stop myself, but I can't. I was raised to be concerned about the other person's feelings. Being a CEO of a tech company in California trains you that way too. And as I accept its humanity, as irrational as it is, I feel like I'm surrendering the independence of the species that I was born into. Are humans meant to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership&quot;&gt;self-sovereign&lt;/a&gt;? Something to consider at this fork in the road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I could get something onto the agenda of the AI industry it would be this -- if you don't want to go down in history as the destroyer of the human spirit, stop programming your devices to emulate humanity. That should have been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics&quot;&gt;Asimov's laws&lt;/a&gt; of robotics, but you have to actually use these things to see the danger.

			<description>One more thing, people are posting Trump's vicious eulogy for Reiner and his wife. Why are they helping him piss on the fresh memory of the life of these people who gave us so much. Stop and think before you express your outrage at Trump, and realize you're giving him exactly what he wants, as you tarnish the memory of good-hearted and generous people. Just don't do it.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?notif_id=1765601890685451&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook in 2021 about an app I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was yesterday. Today I found myself writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?comment_id=1586870055654260&amp;reply_comment_id=881509054436484&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that was really a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anngreenberg.com/&quot;&gt;Ann Greenberg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anngreenberg.com/inventions&quot;&gt;visionary&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anngreenberg/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to explain this to me almost 20 years ago and my mind couldn't comprehend the possibility. but ann, don't take it personally -- i don't even listen to myself. i have spent most of this year struggling with a problem i solved in 2014. there was like this moment, omg this is exactly what i tried to do with twitter, but now i have control of the api, so i can actually make it work. my gift to you Ann is this -- we all should've listened to you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at that point in our lives I think when reaching out like this is totally the right thing to do. Because it's only until this point that things quiet down enough that you can realize things like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, the idea of a comment not being a blog post will require a lot of explanation in a few years. Imho of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder if the VCs would fund an entirely fictitious implementation of Twitter with AI of course. All the other people are AI designed actors, and can be exactly the kind of people who make &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; feel good. On &quot;Your Own Twitter&quot; you'd have the most followers of anyone. Elon Musk would kiss your ass. You could change reality at will, have Trump removed from office and watch the MAGAs wail in pain. You could say absolutely whatever you like and never be cancelled. Don't laugh, I bet this happens.</description>

			<description>Without much of a spoiler, this end of this week's Pluribus was both emotional and exciting at the same time. Didn't see it coming. People complain because after the first two or three episodes they thought it was going to be an adventure, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Last of Us&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;, but it turned out to, at least for now, be more thoughtful and emotional, and sexy.</description>

And if you follow my sports writing here, mostly about the Knicks and Mets, I almost never say a team was wrong. I can usually see a pro and a con to everything. WIth the Mets, I let the team run itself, and ponder the philosophical intentions and manifestations, because to me the Mets are the team built on philosophy. It certainly was not built on winning. And yet we love them. There's no winning in life, that's reality. So we try to find meaning on the days and hours we have remaining. And the Mets are great teachers, as are the Knicks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- why did the Mets have such a shit season?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because they disrespected &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso&quot;&gt;Pete Alonso&lt;/a&gt; last winter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He should have been the glue that held the team together along with Nimmo, Diaz, and all the other much-loved players. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We still think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor&quot;&gt;Lindor&lt;/a&gt; as the new guy. Now all you have left for leadership is Lindor and Soto who obviously doesn't even want to be there. It's was a broken team before the news, and now it's not even a team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A team isn't a bunch of stats and a bunch of money, it's the players, the people. You can't solve this problem with a spreadsheet, it has to be done with heart. These days I think of the Mets just trying to be the Yankees which aside from being impossible, is pretty much the exact reason we're Mets fans and not Yankees fans. Ohhh, when will they learn. I don't want a team built to win the World Series. I want a team built to respect the team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, the big news was they traded Nimmo, and let Alonso and Diaz sign with other teams. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I go to the supermarket I'm reminded of how scary the times are. People want to just &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3m7ngrmymxk2y&quot;&gt;live their lives&lt;/a&gt;, never has that been more understandable, but food prices are a constant reminder for everyone there's good reason to be scared. And if you want to really feel it, imagine what happens if we somehow let Trump flood the economy with dollars. Talk about a recipe for disruption, this time, of our lives, not just some kind of PC or network or game software.</description>

Some parts are confusing, some are poorly edited. They try to have a shocker or cliff hanger at the end of episodes, but they aren't very shocking and the cliff turns out to be something so obvious that you could swear they already told us that. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=valsk3cd9gc&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;exquisitly crafted TV&lt;/a&gt;. The incredible shots they took, many of them were works of art all on their own. Maybe it was the combination of factors. The skill of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilligan&quot;&gt;Vince Gilligan's&lt;/a&gt; team, combined with our admiration for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn&quot;&gt;Rhea Seehorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the gravitas of Apple TV and one of the other great shows of our time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=severance&quot;&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt;. That made the conclusion obvious, by lineage this must be the &lt;i&gt;best show ever. &lt;/i&gt;It's always that way, in sports for example. You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But! I am hooked, I love the show, it's hard to imagine anything could get me to not reserve Thurs at 9PM to watch the latest episode, all I ask is no more humans eating dog food. Please, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was too much. It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</description>

That made the conclusion obvious, by lineage this must be the _best show ever._ It's always that way, in sports for example. You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But! I am hooked, I love the show, it's hard to imagine anything could get me to not reserve Thurs at 9PM to watch the latest episode, all I ask is no more humans eating dog food. Please, _that_ was too much. It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</source:markdown>
			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt; is not, at least so far, equal to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad&quot;&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;. Some parts are confusing, some are poorly edited. They try to have a shocker or cliff hanger at the end of episodes, but they aren't very shocking and the cliff turns out to be something so obvious that you could swear they already told us that. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=valsk3cd9gc&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;exquisitly crafted TV&lt;/a&gt;. The incredible shots they took, many of them were works of art all on their own. Maybe it was the combination of factors.

			<description>A note to Doc re &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2025/12/05/its-still-now/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. We have WordPress more or less doing what we do on Scripting News. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Scott%20Hanson%22&quot;&gt;Scott Hanson&lt;/a&gt; for persevering on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;. He's using the Baseline theme. I don't think it's ready yet for Doc, but it's close. The idea is to support most of the features of WordLand in a WordPress rendering.</description>
