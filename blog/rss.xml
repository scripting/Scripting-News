			<title>An open tweet to Keith Olbermann</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1812139277418971640&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still thinking about your last episode and how you don't know what to tell anyone to do. i think that's great. because no one knows -- in the meantime here are a couple of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;let's organize democratic voters. the better organized we are, the better we can get through the attacks from the nyt, cnn, msnbc, et al that are coming until the election. a web site for circles of friends, a buddy system that gets the word out. can use all social networks, email etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;encourage biden to take off the gloves, even more than he is. he should say the biggest problem is the supreme court. we have to fix it. make this a referendum on roe v wade and all the other stuff that's harder to explain.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ask joe to have fun. he's good when he's saying god love you and shit like that. hand out ice cream when it's hot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;level with people. biden isn't the best speech-maker and 81-year-olds can't run around like they're 50 (he's still figuring that out),  but he's a really good president. think about how it was when trump turned things over. the country was in really bad shape. he totally blew covid. that mattered. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;one more thing -- trump attacked the freaking capitol on his way out. that man has a temper and is a loser. a sore loser &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;biden has friends who help him. make the theme song for the election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C58ttB2-Qg&quot;&gt;help from my friends&lt;/a&gt; by the beatles. put the young stars of the democrats out on the road and sell them as the future that we are working on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the product isn’t just Biden, it’s a freaking goverment and social security, and owning your own body, freedom of religion, all that good american stuff. It’s the governors of pennsylvania, michigan, arizona, the senators from georgia, it’s the whole freaking thing!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;like it or not the debate &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; start the campaign. Everyone is listening to Joe Jobs now, so say things! Dont waste the attention. Never waste a good crisis someone said.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;have you ever seen a campaign speech with &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/whyVoteForBiden/&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; like a Steve Jobs keynote. Some good ideas there. &quot;One more thing.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;KO -- keep up the good work. and ad lib more. some of your writers are pretty lame. i can tell when you wrote the episode, but i like the ones where you ad lib even more.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Route around journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why journalists don’t bother trying to take Trump down, but do with the Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simple. Trump has routed around journalism as we have begged the Dems to by going direct to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The journos have no power over Trump and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They have total power over the Dems, and they know that too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If by some miracle the journos let us (voters) determine the president, we must &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; let them have this power again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had a post here about the inevitability of Biden stepping aside, then I turned on the news and saw how the press was humiliating the President at a meeting with the president of Ukraine. We can't give into this. How dare they insult the president as he represents the US in NATO. I can't get behind this. We're in a bad bad place.</description>

			<title>Nancy Pelosi</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I kind of like what Nancy Pelosi is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She's got a unique role to play, as a master of Washington and national politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and giving her blessings to how they go forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the election. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how she and Biden get along.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's much better to have her leading this discussion than the children who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they don't understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I trust Pelosi in this situation, we're lucky to have her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Resuming the Podcast0 feed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new episode for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcast0/&quot;&gt;Podcast0 feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After a break since June 20, we now resume my original &quot;audio blog&quot; from the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers -- we'll have an original audio blog post. That's when the pulse really starts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/10/upcomingEpisodes.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of upcoming episodes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;morningcoffeenotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quantum-light-breath/id1752527298?i=1000661785816&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; page for this episode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I got the title wrong, it's Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it, and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast clients, I'm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as this one is)? I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I wonder if links make it through to most clients?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; for Podcast0.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.</description>

			<title>Jon Stewart, yes you should STFU</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The problem is elites grabbing the wheel with no clue about what comes next.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/14/bidenActionFigure.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Every Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart's opening for the Daily Show on YouTube. It's always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There's never been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren't any smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that's been the real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we've gotten the tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And now we're at the last moment before it's all flushed away and the NYT et al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don't think I've ever done that in a podcast, and I'm not sure I like it. But the rage is real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/09/yesJonStewartPleaseSTFU.m4a&quot;&gt;16 minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.</description>

The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over." created="Mon, 08 Jul 2024 14:13:18 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/07/08.html#a141318"/>

			<description>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.</description>

			<description>I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of my blog to be an incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;way&lt;/a&gt; to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Most of the time we can turn our attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House, and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the journalists, get away with it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/butHerEmails.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We can't forget her emails, even though we never knew what it was about. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The SF newspaper strike of 1994</title>

I was part of that process, a step in the bootstrap that led to the social web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about that process as journalism system is losing its mind, like everything else, and we need to find a way to flow intelligent news to people who need it, so we can start to organize, and we need to do it &lt;i&gt;now. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The flow are out there, smart people who know stuff and have ideas, but they aren't getting heard amidst the mindlessness of the NYT, CNN, MSNBC et al. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a long story, and it starts off crisp like most of my stories and then rambles out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;16 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Now that the Supreme Court is no longer keeping up any pretense of respecting the Constitution, and journalism is either colluding, or preparing for their meeting with a military tribunal in March next year, followed by, if lucky, a re-education camp, we need help knowing what's real and what's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>It could happen!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; is also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/aPaneerOfLegitimacy.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if anyone else does that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The title of this episode is &quot;A peneer of legitimacy,&quot; but what I really meant is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_veneer&quot;&gt;veneer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I describe a dream where the owner of the NY Times is, in March 2025, being tried by a military tribunal for not sufficiently helping Trump get re-elected as he was told to do. Sulzberger, in his own defense, points out that they covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Biden%27s+Age&quot;&gt;Biden's Age&lt;/a&gt;, the official new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Hillary%27s+Emails&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt;, while ignoring other possible issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tribunal returns with its verdict and hilarity ensues as the punishment, secret until revealed, is administered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The crowd goes crazy! &quot;Too late! Not enough! Go to hell!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The host of the show is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson&quot;&gt;Bart Simpson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It wasn't until I looked at the synopsis of Olbermann's podcast that I learned that something had changed. For whatever reason, even though I have made a significant investment in time to stay informed, it isn't working. Fact.</description>
