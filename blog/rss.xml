			<description>I have an array built into every app I do, on server or in the browser, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/679fe7641178a7946f4b8aab806e0360f85f960d/daveutils.js#L828&quot;&gt;snarkySlogans&lt;/a&gt;. When I need a bit of text to test with I just choose a random snarky slogan. They are little truths that have occurred to me over the years. You're free to steal this code, they do come in handy at times. There's a snarky slogan to cover that -- &quot;Only steal from the best.&quot; Another one I really like: &quot;Just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right.&quot;</description>
