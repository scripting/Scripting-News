This required me to go through some very old code that my system still depends on. It's remarkable how much time this seemingly small feature took to implement. One of these days I have to move this code to one of my more modern servers. One reason it took so long is that a random package that does something that never changes, had a breaking change in it. The breakage culture of the Node.js world is just plain fucked up, no other word for it.</description>

			<description>I've heard that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Andor&lt;/a&gt; is great stuff. I'm on episode 6 of season 1, and it's the usual Star Wars bullshit. It was fun in 1978. But now? It's so freaking boring. Tell me it's worth continuing to watch, that it gets an actual plot at some point.</description>

			<description>I had a neighbor and friend a long time ago named Ann Doerr. I used to joke with her how her name was a combination of two of the main types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate&quot;&gt;logic gates&lt;/a&gt; in computers. I think that's what attracted me to the Star Wars Andor show.</description>

			<description>I now have the special ChatGPT function I've been waiting for. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/&quot;&gt;Codex&lt;/a&gt;. Give it access to my entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;GitHub collection&lt;/a&gt; and let it go. I stopped myself from authorizing, wanting to sleep on it. I know I'm going to do it, but.. Gulp. Do I really want to dump all my thinking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/04/samAltmanAndFriends.png&quot;&gt;Sam Altman&lt;/a&gt;?</description>

			<title>Can David Frum hear me?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been enjoying the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/the-david-frum-show/&quot;&gt;David Frum podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He's very good at thinking and does a lot of it, and expresses himself very well. I read all his columns and have read two of his books, even though I don't share much of his pre-Trump politics, I find it interesting to hear how he parses things. I also subscribe to The Atlantic. I listen to him. But in this week's episode it's clear that the listening is one-way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-showwhy-are-the-media-so-afraid-of-trump/683029/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; we heard from the elite journalist David Frum, interviewing elite editor in chief Marty Barrett, formerly of the Washington Post, and they both make what I believe are wildly inaccurate generalizations about the quality of the news reporting by professionals and the ugliness and inadequacy of bloggers and podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, they don't read widely enough to know that there are bloggers and podcasters with good intentions, ethics, deep knowledge and experience who are also well educated -- they don't know we exist and therefore can't hear about the huge mistakes they are making with their own self-perception of their role that we can see because we are not in their world. (BTW, I have been in their world, I was a contributing editor at Wired, a research fellow at Harvard and NYU, each for two years, and I have collided with Frum-like elites, the usual response is a hand-wave of dismissal, written off as not worth listening to, I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Frum, at the end of the episode talks about how the press covered Biden's incapacity, that led to the second Trump term. They should have stopped, once we were all informed of what happened, and let the &lt;i&gt;electorate&lt;/i&gt; decide, it wasn't up to them, or the celebrities they gave space to in their op-eds. In the United States, the &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; decide. Instead they put up a roadblock and wouldn't let the issue drop. We all knew, we were all informed, probably long before we read a single article about his debate performance. They should have stopped. That was their malpractice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their responsibility was to give us the information, and it was also their responsibility to stop right there. Once informed, they were wrong in continuing to harp on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We saw them do it with Governor Cuomo of New York. And Senator Al Franken. And Donald McNeil at the NY Times. And on and on. There's so much reporting that's lazy and incompetent, but they'll never report on that, because of their conflicts. And they never listen to their critics. And as a result they play a role they are not entitled to play.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They need to wake up to the idea that while reporting from their bubble is still important and is heard, they misuse it regularly, and we are fed up with it. If they want to control the government, do the right thing, and run for office. Don't do it from your byline in the Washington Post or NY Times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My keynote for FediForum</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fediforum.org/&quot;&gt;FediForum&lt;/a&gt; is a virtual conference that starts tomorrow. If they had asked me to keynote, this is roughly what I would say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho this stuff is pretty freaking simple, esp since there are well over 20 years of prior art to use, and not that many ways to do what we're trying to do. I'm impatient, so here's a quick set of observations with my opinion, take it for what it's worth, ymmv, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You shouldn't be reinventing so much. Always look around for &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. That will make it possible for you to interop more quickly at both a software level and at a human level. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't invent stuff you think you may need later. Save that for later. You have no intuition for what's needed and more important nothing to test against. You will get it wrong 100 percent of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't invent stuff you think you may need later that makes what you're doing now more complicated. I see a lot of that in ActivityPub.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only reason you're doing all this work is for interop. If you've been doing it for years and you don't have much meaningful interop you're doing it wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Write the software first. Use formats that exist, or if you must invent new stuff, make sure it's simple. Work on its simplicity as you would any other feature. Factor! If there are going to be 100 interoperable products and you make it a little more difficult to implement, that work will be multiplied 100 times. And it be a barrier to entry, so you may not get the most powerful interop possible with the most interesting products. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Read and follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. There aren't that many. But if you're breaking them, you're not going to end up with a standard. If your goal is to appear to be making standards, you should also read RFSM, and don't do anything in it. I've seen people do that btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Have you looked at the world outside the tech stuff to see how important this all has become? All the time we're wasting is very costly in everything that depends on the social web actually existing as opposed to just being talked about.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, what would I request if I could influence you??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon and Bluesky should support inbound and outbound RSS, and do it really well. Right now they do outbound only, and the implementations are incomplete at covering the functionality they have now, and there needs to be more (see the next item). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They'd support the basic features of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec, including Markdown because it's a great standard, very much of the same school as RSS. If it had existed when we did RSS 2.0 it would have been part of it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. Really not much work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From there we'd have 25 years of interop to explore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we could really call this the open social web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm ready to do it any time you all are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yours in not wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/04/talkVisualized.png&quot;&gt;visualize&lt;/a&gt; me giving this talk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I don't think it's good or bad, it could work out great. No one knows if this was The Season the Knicks were meant to go to the Finals, but if it was, maybe next year will be too? There's no right answer. Maybe this was Dolan's call. I hope not.</description>

			<description>If you followed the Knicks through the playoffs as I did, I recommend the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/indianas-incredible-finals-run-a-knicks-summer/id1043699613?i=1000710778336&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Bill Simmons podcast. It began with talk about the fan base and that got me thinking. We don't know what would happen if the Knicks were in the Finals. Honestly. It could be the antidote to the crazyness. Maybe the reason things are so fucked up is that it's been 52 freaking years since the Knicks won the title. Something happens every so often, the energy field around the Knicks shifts -- Patrick Ewing, Melo, Linsanity and now Brunson. It'd be interesting to map that out against events in the world at the corresponding times. We won't find out this year. In the same way I sensed that New Orleans was doomed when I went to school there, I have a strong feeling connecting the Knicks to something not sure what, but it feels big.</description>

The problem with Bluesky and Mastodon is that they're coming from Twitter, and think they're aiming toward the web, apparently -- but they must not understand the web, because they're going to have to break with Twitter's model in &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;so many ways&lt;/a&gt; to reach the web, they'll never get there if they go slowly. If you tried to develop the social web by starting with the web, you arrive at a different place, w/o all the problems of twitter-like systems.

This is exactly the kind of query I've been begging Google to support for decades. They could have figured out where my blog is, or let me tell it where it is. Famously they once asked if I had misspelled my mother's last name in a query. How freaking clueless can you get.&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/hating-new-york&quot;&gt;Krugman is right&lt;/a&gt;, living in NYC is amazing. When I lived in Manhattan betw 2010 and 2019, I had it great but toward the end I yearned to live in the mountains, the year before Covid hit (that was a bad time to be in Manhattan, btw). Now I yearn to again live in the city. Funny how that works. Even in the 70s I felt safe in NYC, and I commuted to school from Queens to the Bronx. It was safe enough to let a 14 year old kid ride the subway into Manhattan and up to the Bronx and back, every freaking day. I never got mugged. And I did all kinds of dangerous stuff that independent-minded teen agers do. If you can afford it, I recommend you spend some time in NYC before you believe the bullshit the Repubs say about it. They have reasons not to like the cities that have nothing to do with how nice it is. In NYC we don't trust our politicians to tell the truth. You shouldn't trust yours so much either, dear Republicans. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>In honor of the Knicks' very successful season, I temporarily put the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/27/knicksFansWithBagsOverHeads.png&quot;&gt;paper bags fans&lt;/a&gt; at the top of my home page as a reminder to anyone who wants to blame someone on the Knicks for how the season turned out.

			<title>Suggestion to WordPress devs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a screen shot of a post written by Doc Searls as viewed in Bluesky. It's jarring. The big picture of Doc gets in the way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;//s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/06/02/docInBluesky.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Doc's post as viewed in Bluesky. His picture dominates. Imho it shouldn't.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realize no one designed this, but it also is reality, it's how a lot of people see Doc's writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my suggestion. When the user specifies a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt; for a post, set the og:image element in the head section of the page. When they don't specify such an image, omit that element. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how we did it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/160323.html&quot;&gt;Baseline theme&lt;/a&gt;, and I, as the writer, am happy with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Your butt still stinks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Human beings spend far to much effort feeling better than some people or feeling inferior to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is understandable, I guess, as far as evolution is concerned, up to a point, but I think we've been past that point for a long time now. Now, evolution brought us to a point where in order to survive as a species we have to get over this need to rank people and work together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you feel other people are better than you, get over it. Same thing if you feel better than others. You aren't and they aren't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your shit still stinks and as the great Republican philosopher Joni Ernst so eloquently put it, she's going to be dead pretty darned soon and so will you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to remind myself of this when I see a picture of someone who is really ugly but acts like they're not. And when I say ugly, I mean ugly inside. I say to myself &quot;Davey, they are reflecting off something inside yourself that you don't like. On a different day they might seem very beautiful to you!&quot; So I can relax and stop worrying so much about what I think about them in the moment. It matters not one bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml&quot;&gt;month gone&lt;/a&gt;, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven't had a drink in months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen who isn't as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply &quot;Let's go Mets!&quot; I like that, though it will of course take me some time to get re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-highlight-jalen-josh-explain-why-the-yankees/id1729497779?i=1000710590814&quot;&gt;his podcast&lt;/a&gt; that New York has two teams, the Knicks (I agree) and the Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team without &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change some things over the summer, and I've heard that they might try to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22kevin%20durant%22&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt;. I sure hope not. I think the Knicks are benefiting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/&quot;&gt;the jinx&lt;/a&gt; he put on himself when he tried in vain to stir up a &quot;rivalry&quot; between the Knicks and the Brooklyns. No, that isn't likely to happen, unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the butt like KD did. Maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers&quot;&gt;Portland Trail Blazers&lt;/a&gt; will want him. That's about as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Portland,+OR/@41.7399086,-119.4458701,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6783853!2d45.515232!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; from New York as you can get in the NBA. And with that I now officially shut the door on the 2024-25 NBA season. We had a great run. See you all in October! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
