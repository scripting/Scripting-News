			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/14.html#a144157&quot;&gt;Last year on this day&lt;/a&gt;: We have too many modes of writing. I just wrote a blog post that's also a tweet. Why didn't it go to my followers on all the social nets I'm on? Why do I have to use a different editor to post to each of the services? That's the point of Textcasting, btw.</description>

			<description>We're going to open testing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; shortly. At first I only want developers who write great bug reports. My goal is to speed up development and reduce wear and tear on me. Once we're confident it really works as advertised, we'll open up the testing further. There will be a form you can fill out to get in the queue. The choice of the first testers will be highly subjective.</description>

			<description>BTW, start thinking of WordPress as a highly networked, deployed, debugged, widely supported &lt;b&gt;network operating system&lt;/b&gt;. It meets all the criteria. It also has storage. And can publish. And unlike other social web systems, it is textcasting-ready since it comes from the world of blogging where we competed to give writers the features they needed. We can build lots of apps on this foundation.</description>

			<description>I've been having a one-sided discussion with Bluesky asking they make their product less vulnerable to takeover by tech bros, and I can't tell if they're doing anything about it. They must be conflicted, on the one hand, they clearly could sell there service now for a lot of money, but when they do that they must know they're selling us out.</description>

			<description>I am working on a text editor for WordPress using MediumEditor, but I save the text in Markdown and when I reload the Markdown text I regenerate the HTML. I think the social web should exchange Markdown as the canonical form of web text. It has the right set of features, it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html&quot;&gt;Just Enough HTML&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>There isn’t a single social web network that I like pouring my creativity into. I feel like I’m being used not appreciated. There’s nothing in it for me. I had a similar feeling for Twitter, but they were the only one. Now there are a bunch, and I honestly don't care about any of them, esp now that the election is over. I think this whole idea of feeding the greed of a bunch of tech people is over. If there's a good place to gather, with a small number of people I relate to as people, then I'm up for that, but none of these services meet that need.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT can't remember my coding conventions. It always falls back to using features of JavaScript I told it not to use. I indent my code according to the way it works in an outliner, so I can't use their code without having to manually modify it. I haven't forgotten that I'm the human and it's the computer. Its memory is supposed to be perfect. And I am a paying customer, btw.</description>

			<title>Are you the nerd of the year??</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you ask for something with Bluesky they tell you about how a user account is like a website, you just have to make it work a certain way, that some devs have mastered, and I guess I could too, but right now all my attention is focused on WordPress and getting it to work well with ActivityPub so my editor can get directly into the Mastodon network and possibly with Threads too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what about Bluesky which is growing like a weed now??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might be easy for the right person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Come up with an interface that makes it so that a WordPress blog is just a user on the Bluesky network.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They have a nice API, I've just spent a year implementing on top of it. I imagine for someone who knows both WordPress and Bluesky this might be a weekend project? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Do it, and blow our minds! There's a lot of content out there in WordPress and a lot of people publish on it.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the best part of it is that it totally drives adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; which is my not so hidden agenda. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And for the people who are starting to think it's only an ActivityPub thing, think again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you do this you might not win the Nobel Peace Prize but you will be Nerd of the Year in my book! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>2024 is different from 2016</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/mobIncited.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It's good to have a record of the things you posted and when you posted it. On August 12 of this year, I tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3kzjvirjq3d2q&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the NYT makes Trump sound like a reasonable candidate that a sane person might vote for, remember this day.&quot; I included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/trumpIncitesMob.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the front page of the NYT on Jan 7, 2021. One in three Trump voters still &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/froomkin/status/1856384929476624841&quot;&gt;watch mainstream news&lt;/a&gt;, which follows the lead of the NYT, and if they had been straight with us, perhaps enough people who like Trump's style would have realized the danger, and voted in a conservative way, ie to conserve the Constitution. Because of how they covered it, we now get to re-run the 2016 experiment all over again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trump-won-what-now-with-heather-cox-richardson/id1583132133?i=1000676185735&quot;&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/a&gt; points out in Jon Stewart's weekly podcast (a must-listen) -- we have more experience too, and perhaps will know better how to deal with Trump and know that &lt;b&gt;his bark is often worse than his bite.&lt;/b&gt; I have to say as the new reality sinks in, I'm not as scared as I was on Election Night last week or even Election Night in 2016. A lot of people will sell out this time who didn't before. But the problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,  and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears. You think inflation was bad? This will be far worse and it's happening now, and nothing we can do at a human scale will make it go away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're dealing with a very unusual drought in the eastern US now. Fires are breaking out where we never used to have them. Yeah this shit is real, and even people who don't believe in science are feeling it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As someone once said, you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/xdc8t4/never_let_a_good_crisis_go_to_waste/&quot;&gt;never waste a good crisis&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of other people feel compelled to move. Unfortunately some are moving to the wrong place, as they always do. Making change isn't easy, but is possible, if you understand how people move. As they try to figure out what the Dem's failed at, that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Skate to where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1bvv11l/i_skate_to_where_the_puck_is_going_to_be_not/&quot;&gt;puck will be&lt;/a&gt;, not where it was, as another famous philosopher once said. And people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors (which I said, sadly, but then put that fact to use to get various standards to fly by without debate). There is a method to human madness, in other words, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A lot of people will sell out this time who didn't before. But the problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,  and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears.

			<description>Update: My guess is that they haven't released enough code to run a Bluesky of your own, because all the answers from people who say they know say the same thing -- &quot;It doesn't work that way.&quot; You &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; write your own, but if we were to do that, why use their one-off API, use a standard instead, and we might have a chance to interop with other systems in a meaningful way. I don't blame them for wanting to cash out, but I do blame them for conning people into believing it's some kind of escape. Until I hear otherwise Bluesky is a dead-end, not worth investing your hope in. If you're migrating from Twitter this is no better. Keep looking. But I promise to let you know if I get any info that changes my opinion, so if I've got it wrong, people from Bluesky, just answer the freaking question in the post at the top of this page. Thanks.</description>

			<title>Democratic mistakes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've actually written a lot, but haven't wanted to publish most of it. So many reasons why the Dems lost. Maybe I should just list them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden shouldn't have run again. There would have been a primary. Given the result of the election this week, we should have found out what support each candidate had with voters. We didn't get to choose the candidate. That said Harris ran a fantastic campaign. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden should not have shut down his campaign website. Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. &lt;b&gt;We were not part of governing&lt;/b&gt;. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama. This is probably the biggest single mistake the Dems keep making.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We needed a prosecutor at the top of Justice. I don't know what Garland actually did, but I'm sure it will all be swept out by whoever is Trump's AG. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Men's votes need to be sought and welcomed, specifically. So much has been done to alienate male voters, which is why so many voted for Trump. We could have had a bunch of them this year, if we had only spoken to them with respect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if we can reboot the Democrats as an opposition party given all these problems. Whatever comes next is going to perform very differently from the party that lost this election. If we try to do it again the same old way, it will fail even worse. I think everyone knows this by now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="Biden should not have shut down his campaign website. Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. &lt;b&gt;We were not part of governing&lt;/b&gt;. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama.

Rather than doing that, I'll quote the important part. &quot;I don't think it's about economics, I think it's about change happening too fast.

			<description>First thing -- &lt;b&gt;Don't shut down the campaign&lt;/b&gt;. We must keep communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down. Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing. And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero after election, whether we win or lost.</description>

There's no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat for all our problems. It's no accident that the Repubs own the men. We could probably have had ten percent or more of their voters if we stopped doing this. Key point, when you blame a whole gender, you hurt people who have no power to stop it.</description>

I recommended it yesterday as inspirational. Now that we know the outcome of the election, it's a marker of where we were before the results were known. A world that no longer exists. But like stories written in 2016, the markers are useful to see where we once were and how we got here, and what we can learn from what happened between. I wish it had turned out the way these two great friends thought it should have. But it didn't. But there was a hint that they knew what wouldn't work this time. No spoilers.</description>

			<description>Ben Thompson wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt; newsletter: &quot;What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective it’s a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!&quot; I wrote in 2017, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;some Repub would buy Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now. When I begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612&quot;&gt;didn't&lt;/a&gt; miss this.</description>

			<description>Speaking of Musk, maybe he will temper Trump's desire for retribution. It may be a vain hope, but I'll cling to it anyway. Doing business in a world of retribution might not be too conducive to the creativity needed to run innovative tech businesses. A climate of fear doesn't inspire great software. I know the quality of products Musk makes, I own and love my Tesla Model Y. Best car I've ever owned or driven.</description>

			<description>Final note (I think). The pain you feel at first may abate. It did for me. I had pushed down memories of 2020 and 2021. It was a horror show, and Trump was the main character. So the first thing I had to deal with is that I don't want to remember that. Too painful. But once I realized that's not where we are right now, it's a totally different situation, that's when the creative impulse rose as the pain receded. We have one short term thing to do -- keep the campaign running, and long term we have to recognize division we add, and counteract it. We are the party that welcomes everyone regardless or race, religion, country of origin, age or gender. &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of them. No exceptions. The election result represents big change. And it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;good time&lt;/a&gt; to make more changes.</description>

He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he couldn't share. I certainly understand that.

And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people who didn't use &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't know &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png&quot;&gt;how to find&lt;/a&gt; them.

That list should update every hour for any additions or removals from this list. I don't update the list very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me know if you do, I'd love to see what you do.</description>

			<title>Rebooting the news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My opinion: At this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know the basic rules of journalism, imho that's much easier than the know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/&quot;&gt;view from nowhere&lt;/a&gt;, trying to understand what they're writing about. They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt; and I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;series of podcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer. I think that's the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on current events. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this, the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn't now be owned by Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking with a few hundred. So they read each others' work, and try not to be too far off the consensus. It's at best an art, at worst they're just press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain directions. Don't overlook that the money is flowing to the same businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but there at least there's objective news to report on, you know -- the score of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded. In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the journalists we have don't report it. There's a lot of inputs that are connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/241102/p54#a241102p54&quot;&gt;top item&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/03/iowapoll.png&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt; is about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/&quot;&gt;poll in Iowa&lt;/a&gt; that says Harris is ahead.

			<title>Could a Musk buy Bluesky?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at will.&quot; It's a good practice, and while I completely support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community, and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that their pitch is a scam, and they're building value in a user base that they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the founders may have already sold some of their stock in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a&quot;&gt;latest investment round&lt;/a&gt; which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they're open, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the only way to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; do it is to &quot;provide a download that you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of confusion.&quot; (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too much into their promise of being open.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw had an open API too, and it's pretty good, but they never offered the option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else build one of those? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In early 2017 I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a president. This value wasn't on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it could possibly gain him control of part of the US government's $6 trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.. He could probably start borrowing against it the day after the election is called for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it's possible they have a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that's why it's a question.

			<description>People may question my credentials as a language designer. I've designed a very innovative system that unfortunately the academics don't think is worth studying. It's utterly ridiculous. Who says you can only learn from systems developed at big companies or universities. I cover a lot of ground, it's true -- no one gave me permission to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn't feel I needed permission. Or funding for that matter. I think what happened is Apple positioned us as less significant than their system scripting language, and people just accepted that, when Frontier is a far superior system. Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier&quot;&gt;ideas are there&lt;/a&gt; anyway, and you're welcome to learn from them.</description>

			<title>Government should work quietly</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I kept waiting for Kamala to say what we're not going back to is Trump. We've paid our dues. He's had enough of our attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Government should do its work quietly, making things better for the people and that's all, and until there's a crisis that demands our attention, stays out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/02/ygritte.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Keep the drama on Netflix and HBO.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
