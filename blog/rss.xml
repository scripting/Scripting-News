They're right. It is a small piece that can be hooked into lots of places, as is WordPress a big place that can host lots of apps many of which haven't been written yet. Products that look outward that can be hooked up in a million ways to everything, and leave the door open for those who follow. Such products are rare in our world. People always try to own their users by locking out competitors. I found a perfect spot for me to put some software, and I am having fun watching people use it, and coming up with new features that build on what we have. I think the writing tools market for WordPress will be huge, and I firmly believe that will turn into what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, which you could also think of as just the web. Ben thinks of it as the &quot;indie web,&quot; and that's fine. It's all just the web. Anyway, I should have put something here a long time ago, but I didn't look inside WordPress until a couple of years ago and I really liked what I found.</description>

			<description>Mini-spoilers follow. I'm a Severance lover, it's definitely one of the best shows ever, and I feel even more so after the season 2 finale which I watched last night on AppleTV+. I think there are two types of Severance users. One whose focus is on the evil and the other whose focus is on the love. If you think nothing happened in the finale then you're the first type, if you are the second type, this episode was incredible rich. And we learned what the goats were about and that's not nothing.</description>

A ChatGPT with instructions on how to help a user with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. Try clicking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; and see what happens, esp if you're a regular WordLand user. I discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right. I've been using ChatGPT to develop the product, so it's possible it has retained some of the info. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; are on the web. This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to ingest everything it can find. Worried about hallucinations. But with a product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests are not problems with WordLand itself. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/62&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where you can report on your experience. Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/commentGuidelines/&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks!</description>

			<description>I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeffcnichols.net/2025/03/20/the-writers-web-aka-blogging/&quot;&gt;Jeff Nichols' piece&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't agree that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt; is blogging. I think it's bigger. Blogging is &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the writer's web. Today's writing network is much more powerful, the software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn't exist last time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better because it's of the web, with &lt;i&gt;no limits. &lt;/i&gt;We've got the beginning of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing and reading environments, and we don't need federation because the web takes care of that.</description>

So Twitter made subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky, etc mostly can't get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking about it and while they do, we're losing everything that's important to us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can't all be masters of our own silo'd domain. We need a web for words that's simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn't lose the essential features writers need. I don't know what we need to win, but I do know what we need to get started.</description>

			<title>Using ChatGPT for tech support</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong.

			<description>A piece that Paul Krugman should write. How what Musk is doing to the US is worse than the 2009 near-collapse of the world economy. People who think he's going to bring down just the US, should recall how close we all came to falling into the abyss. But this time there will be no one to save us.</description>

			<description>The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things that don't belong to them. There's no policing. The richest people are the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people's creations. That's the common theme. Now they're in DC, going for all of it. The whole thing. But they're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0&quot;&gt;dog that catches the car&lt;/a&gt;. They don't have the slightest idea what to do with what they're taking. How could they? It's incomprehensibly vast.</description>

I'm publishing these so people get an idea of the structures we're working with. It's basically a WordPress post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS, Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out, there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2, Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol, Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol designer, don't try to plan for things you don't have a working model of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together will work much better. And only add things you're willing to live with forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the format we work with inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, and more important, in the new APIs, that build on and simplify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpcom&quot;&gt;excellent API&lt;/a&gt; that Automattic had already produced.</description>

			<title>John Palfrey on the moment</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn't happened yet. A lot of people weren't yet aware. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt;, who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I'm going to publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the places I'm hooked into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out loud in public: &quot;we believe in the rule of law in America&quot;? That seems not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this topic is what is striking me most at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing, to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with impunity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves just one. This is not &quot;fancy law stuff&quot;. This is &quot;4th grade civics stuff&quot; -- separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we don't teach civics enough in America...).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It is actually *not* more complicated than that. It can't be that hard to say out loud: &quot;we value the rule of law in America&quot; -- no matter your politics or party.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Get back on the air</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Dems highest priority should be to get the Kamala Harris campaign back on social media, 24 by 7, with the truth and snark, irreverance, disrespectful of the Repubs, as a matter of principle. They were great. Perfect. We need a voice for the Democrats on the social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would someone please send this to AOC, Jasmine Crockett, Bernie Sanders, Mark Cuban, James Carville, anyone else you can think of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems only problem is there is no voice, no pulse, no heartbeat. Even without this, they almost won the last election. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything you like about government came from the Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We miss you. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22on%20the%20air%22&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; on the air! No time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Poking around on old servers I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsonify.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;this cute little app&lt;/a&gt; that jsonifies an RSS feed. Not sure why I did it. Postscript, it only works for one feed, mine. I replaced it with a template in the feeder app which was a useful version of the cute little app. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/?template=jsonify&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjeffmilner.com%2F%3Ffeed%3Drss2&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of it viewing the contents of a feed in JSON using a special template.</description>

			<title>Blogging is due for a refresh</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Websockets have replaced long polling. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SQL is fast and the tools are much better.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from  twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to get a list of old school bloggers who are still at it. How would you go about that? I decided to give it to Gemini, limiting it at first to 100 bloggers. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/finding-old-school-bloggers-who-are-still-at-it/&quot;&gt;prompt&lt;/a&gt; I wrote. For a while I was wondering what &quot;deep research&quot; was for, but as it's starting the work, I'm thinking of resources that would fit in -- like blogtree.com -- a fascinating site, gives a clear picture how blogs emerge out of the community of an earlier blog. Anyway it's working on it while I write this post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An application ChatGPT is great it. You're staring at some code, it's really straightforward, you've done this a thousand times, but it doesn't work. Stare at it some more. Try re-entering it. Change the names of things. Still doesn't work. Copy and paste the problem code into ChatGPT and in an instant it tells you without you even having to ask that your comment isn't properly terminated, so the runtime was never seeing the code, and nothing I did made the slightest difference. The information was there. I had been staring at it, but humans see what we expect to see. Machines don't have that problem, at least not in this way (thinking of hallucinations).</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/07/05/pinkyFacingLeft.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Why is scripting.com not https? I hope you can see that I have no trouble deploying https sites here. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; on my Linux servers, and I don't see why anyone uses anything else. It's really easy and requires none of the work people complain about. Anyway the reason scripting.com is http and not https is that the site dates back to 1994, before there was such a thing as https. Google didn't start their push to get the web to convert to https until 2014, 20 years after I started blogging. Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/12/31.html&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, the're pretty much all there. This is something I'm proud of. I wanted to create a record from the start, it was very deliberate. I was already an experienced developer when the web started up, so I had an idea what I was doing. I also use images on my site, in the right margin of posts, and lately as &quot;inline&quot; images, in their own boxes with a caption. It's a way for me to play with the ideas, and adds color to pages that are almost all text. So if I were to move the site from S3 to one of my hosted servers, which would be a fairly major undertaking on its own and add a lot of overhead because Amazon takes care of a lot of the bullshit you have to deal with, there would be a small matter of what about the images? They would all break if scripting.com was hosted on https and they were served from http. Now you might say -- Dave all you have to do is move all those images to a place with https support and remap the domains, and take care of all the michegas that's going to pop up. Or suffer with broken images. I decided to instead tell Google to stop trying to own something that belongs to no one and everyone. If they want a more secure web, create it, and make a browser for it, and respect the original web alone. Hopefully this clears it up.</description>

			<source:outline text="Why is scripting.com not https? I hope you can see that I have no trouble deploying https sites here. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; on my Linux servers, and I don't see why anyone uses anything else. It's really easy and requires none of the work people complain about. Anyway the reason scripting.com is http and not https is that the site dates back to 1994, before there was such a thing as https. Google didn't start their push to get the web to convert to https until 2014, 20 years after I started blogging. Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/12/31.html&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, the're pretty much all there. This is something I'm proud of. I wanted to create a record from the start, it was very deliberate. I was already an experienced developer when the web started up, so I had an idea what I was doing. I also use images on my site, in the right margin of posts, and lately as &quot;inline&quot; images, in their own boxes with a caption. It's a way for me to play with the ideas, and adds color to pages that are almost all text. So if I were to move the site from S3 to one of my hosted servers, which would be a fairly major undertaking on its own and add a lot of overhead because Amazon takes care of a lot of the bullshit you have to deal with, there would be a small matter of what about the images? They would all break if scripting.com was hosted on https and they were served from http. Now you might say -- Dave all you have to do is move all those images to a place with https support and remap the domains, and take care of all the michegas that's going to pop up. Or suffer with broken images. I decided to instead tell Google to stop trying to own something that belongs to no one and everyone. If they want a more secure web, create it, and make a browser for it, and respect the original web alone. Hopefully this clears it up." created="Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:16:03 GMT" type="outline" image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/07/05/pinkyFacingLeft.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/15.html#a131603"/>

			<description>I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67d580b2-8a68-8012-ad1a-65f2553978bb&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; when Google started making HTTPS a requirement. Then I asked when was HTTPS first deployed, and was surprised it was in 1994 in Netscape Navigator. But apparently it was really buggy and wasn't codified until much later. Then I asked when HTTPS became the norm? 2017. So there's a lot of web out there that isn't being maintained by anyone, it just works, that predates HTTPS being widely adopted, if you believe the timelines ChatGPT produced.</description>

Every time I see a condescending TikTok story about them, I think about how that takes us further from getting where we must go. We have to reconcile, we share a country, and our interests are totally aligned. We need each other, that will become completely obvious, and the sooner it does the better.</description>

			<description>Saw an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6h6QGVfrgQ&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Mark Cuban where they asked why would Elon Musk do something that would cause Tesla stock to tank. He's got the power to play with the biggest financial thing that has ever existed, and quite possibly that ever will exist. In comparison Tesla is just one car company, with a lot of competition, a market-leading product for sure, but the competition is catching up. They're constantly lowering prices to keep the volume up, so eventually the stock will have to come down anyway. He certainly knows stuff about the company that no one else can see, maybe their new product pipeline is empty? He also has had to deal with short-sellers who have the incentive to drive the price down, and he can't bet alongside them (how would that look, a CEO betting against his own company). No matter what, there is nothing bigger than the USA, and he's got it, and plans to keep it. But he's human, and thus has frailties, and he loses as often as he wins and knows it. Unfortunately for us we're all in his boat now, unless somehow we can wrench it back.</description>

			<title>&quot;It's the people, stupid!&quot;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing pundits and incumbent Democrats missing the point, that the people are the ones whose opinion matters about the Republicans dismantling our democracy in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to celebrate those leaders who totally get that the power is with the people, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. They are an inspiration! I live in New York and while AOC doesn't represent me in Congress (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)&quot;&gt;Pat Ryan&lt;/a&gt; is my rep), in a political and spiritual way she most definitely represents me. She should be the next president, as far as I'm concerned. She has all the leadership abilities we could ever want. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My contribution for today is the slogan that's the title of this piece. It's derived from James Carville's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid&quot;&gt;slogan&lt;/a&gt; when Bill Clinton was running for president in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, updated for 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's the people, dummy!&quot; was always the right slogan.

			<title>The writer's web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The web was initially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt&quot;&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; for writers. Styling, links, paragraphs, titles (at all levels). The ability to edit. No character limits. That's what we had to work with when we started blogging in the mid-late 90s.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then there was a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/22/tenYearsUsingTwitter.html&quot;&gt;corner-turn&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. In an instant the web shrunk to almost nothing. No titles, no style, no links, 140 chars max. Enough to say &quot;I'm waiting in line at the bank.&quot; Nothing wrong with that, but it isn't what I think of as writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I decided to focus on writers once again. I started developing ideas of what &lt;b&gt;the writer's web&lt;/b&gt; would look like if we used today's technology. And here are the three main directions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;New technology&lt;/b&gt;. Since the last time we looked, Markdown was invented. RSS feeds had become instant.

We'll use all the best new technology.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modern interfaces&lt;/b&gt;. We'll borrow the best ideas from twitter-like systems. Writing a new post should be as easy as writing a tweet, but with all the features writers need at-hand, easy to access. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open, for real&lt;/b&gt;. And best of all, it'll be open, for real, now -- not some day. Each component will be completely replaceable with simple APIs, and lots of example code. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use WordPress as my basic back-end technology because it is reliable and broadly deployed, but you don't have to.

The only question is whether we &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Best way to get started -- write a blog post about what the writer's web means to you. Send me a link.

			<title>Bluesky is not billionaire-proof</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First I want to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; is nice software, good design, attractive, they have a goal and stick to it, and it stays up, no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/?gift=f35zZN0v_gDFE8xNwlQAHSNkdwehtNpsP-bh1d4EoU4&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&quot;&gt;fail whales&lt;/a&gt; that were so vexing of early days Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That said, I have two criticisms:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They are implementing the same limits that Twitter designed into their product, no styling, no links, you can't edit, no titles, enclosures, and a limit of 300 chars per post. Simple stuff that, if they broke through the Twitter design, would make it a decent platform for writers. I don't see any reason to duplicate the mistakes that Twitter made, in 2006, in the design of their product.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They repeatedly claim to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html&quot;&gt;billionaire-proof&lt;/a&gt; but as far as I can tell, and I have built software on their APIs, they are not. Yet they tell users they are safe, and what choice do the users have but to believe them, esp when tech journalism repeats the claims without challenging them. As a result, people believe that if Bluesky were to be acquired by a billionaire, something they might not even be able to stop, they will be able to quickly migrate to something that's the same as Bluesky and keep all their connections, people they follow and people following them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of this would be nice, if it were true but imho it is not true. I'm going to go through the recent statement from their CEO in the remainder of this piece. I invite them to rebut it, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/user/mmasnick/&quot;&gt;Mike Masnick&lt;/a&gt; of Techdirt, who has journalistic integrity, is widely respected, and is on the Bluesky board of directors. Honestly I can't understand why Masnick puts his integrity on the line here, I've tried to discuss it with him, and I guess he doesn't take me seriously enough to give a serious response. I would also like to know what his deal is with them, does he profit personally if Bluesky is acquired. That needs to be disclosed, imho. I would do it if I were in his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you read my blog, I hope you know that I wouldn't challenge something like this unless I was pretty sure there is an issue. I don't imagine for a second that people would abandon Bluesky if they knew they were locked in and would have no path out if it was bought by a billionaire. I know we can't get out and I still use Bluesky, because that's where the people I want to network with are. They won. So they don't have to deceive. They can stop making this claim. Yet they continue to do it, in pretty much exactly the same terms as they have been doing it all along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the statement that appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/at-sxsw-bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-pokes-fun-at-mark-zuckerberg-with-latin-phrase-t-shirt/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The quote is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber&quot;&gt;Jay Graber&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of the company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go through it, point by point&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;they could fork it off and go on to another application&quot; -- in this sentence &quot;they&quot; applies to developers, because you have to be a developer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)&quot;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; an application. Assuming Bluesky is available in source code, with an appropriate open source license, and they have released enough code so that a developer could quickly launch an exact Bluesky clone, maybe this part is true. I can't evaluate it without going through the exercise of forking their code, but I do know this -- no one has. Why not? I would think that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/bluesky-statistics&quot;&gt;27 million users&lt;/a&gt;, by now someone would have tried it. Maybe this post will uncover such an instance, or motivate one. I would be happy to try it out to see how it works. But it has to be completely independent of Bluesky. It would have to work, without loss of functionality, if Bluesky's network disappeared.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;there’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network&quot; -- this is true. But they don't do very much nor do they have many users. They are basically experiments that show that you could build something else with the format they have defined. This isn't unusual. You can make a lot of different kinds of websites with HTML, for example, but very few of them have millions of users. Same thing with apps built on the Bluesky protocol that use data types that Bluesky itself doesn't understand. I don't think this adds anything to the claim of billionaire-safety. Also if these apps are in the same network, that doesn't give us any independence from Bluesky. So I think this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)&quot;&gt;no-op&lt;/a&gt;, it adds nothing but confusion to the claim.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;[our] openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative&quot; -- this is not true, and it's the crux of the concern. There is no such guarantee. If there were, we would be able to move to an alternative now. Where is it? It's not there and imho it can't be there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are other problems. Mastodon, via its API, actually does what Bluesky claims to do. There are lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-server-instance&quot;&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; of Mastodon servers and they interop with each other. It's an incredible proof of concept. But its federation ability adds enough complexity that most people prefer Bluesky, which doesn't have those complications. There are always tradeoffs in technology. You can have flexibility but it comes at a price. Bluesky would have you believe you can have the flexibility of Mastodon without paying the price. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There may be a way to do what they promise, but it would mean removing features, which isn't a bad idea, but they have decided they have to do everything Twitter does and there is the conundrum. Twitter was designed around centralization, and because of that Twitter is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; billionaire-proof as has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Business_career&quot;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, and neither is Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I read this quote from their CEO it gets my bile up, and I say things &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; that I regret later. Instead I decided to take the time this morning to carefully explain the problem and now when they make the claim, I can point to this piece. And maybe I'm wrong, and they can show me an instance I can switch to and not lose access to my network of friends on Bluesky and not depend on the existence of Bluesky itself. That would actually make me happy (I think) and give me a completely new understanding of computer science. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative.”" created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:45:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a114510"/>

					<source:outline text="&quot;they could fork it off and go on to another application&quot; -- in this sentence &quot;they&quot; applies to developers, because you have to be a developer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)&quot;&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; an application. Assuming Bluesky is available in source code, with an appropriate open source license, and they have released enough code so that a developer could quickly launch an exact Bluesky clone, maybe this part is true. I can't evaluate it without going through the exercise of forking their code, but I do know this -- no one has. Why not? I would think that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/bluesky-statistics&quot;&gt;27 million users&lt;/a&gt;, by now someone would have tried it. Maybe this post will uncover such an instance, or motivate one. I would be happy to try it out to see how it works. But it has to be completely independent of Bluesky. It would have to work, without loss of functionality, if Bluesky's network disappeared." created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:46:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a114610"/>
					<source:outline text="&quot;there’s already applications in the network that give you another way to view the network&quot; -- this is true. But they don't do very much nor do they have many users. They are basically experiments that show that you could build something else with the format they have defined. This isn't unusual. You can make a lot of different kinds of websites with HTML, for example, but very few of them have millions of users. Same thing with apps built on the Bluesky protocol that use data types that Bluesky itself doesn't understand. I don't think this adds anything to the claim of billionaire-safety. Also if these apps are in the same network, that doesn't give us any independence from Bluesky. So I think this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)&quot;&gt;no-op&lt;/a&gt;, it adds nothing but confusion to the claim." created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:49:15 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a114915"/>
					<source:outline text="&quot;[our] openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a new alternative&quot; -- this is not true, and it's the crux of the concern. There is no such guarantee. If there were, we would be able to move to an alternative now. Where is it? It's not there and imho it can't be there." created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:54:12 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a115412"/>

				<source:outline text="There are other problems. Mastodon, via its API, actually does what Bluesky claims to do. There are lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-server-instance&quot;&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; of Mastodon servers and they interop with each other. It's an incredible proof of concept. But its federation ability adds enough complexity that most people prefer Bluesky, which doesn't have those complications. There are always tradeoffs in technology. You can have flexibility but it comes at a price. Bluesky would have you believe you can have the flexibility of Mastodon without paying the price." created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:28:14 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a122814"/>
				<source:outline text="There may be a way to do what they promise, but it would mean removing features, which isn't a bad idea, but they have decided they have to do everything Twitter does and there is the conundrum. Twitter was designed around centralization, and because of that Twitter is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; billionaire-proof as has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Business_career&quot;&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, and neither is Bluesky." created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:15:44 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a121544"/>
				<source:outline text="Every time I read this quote from their CEO it gets my bile up, and I say things &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; that I regret later. Instead I decided to take the time this morning to carefully explain the problem and now when they make the claim, I can point to this piece. And maybe I'm wrong, and they can show me an instance I can switch to and not lose access to my network of friends on Bluesky and not depend on the existence of Bluesky itself. That would actually make me happy (I think) and give me a completely new understanding of computer science." created="Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:16:27 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/11/113838.html#a121627"/>

			<description>BTW it's worth &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html&quot;&gt;calling attention&lt;/a&gt; to a bit I linked to yesterday. &lt;i&gt;Cross-posting to Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.&lt;/i&gt; They are too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that's like stereo to mono. We're not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo'd boxes in order to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan, if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don't know. But it's a bizarre situation that I've decided to try to fix.</description>

			<description>The word is starting to spread about &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. And the product is holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me think it's not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful. His respect means a lot to me. The positioning -- it makes WordPress as easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it. That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and it's right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting memorandum&lt;/a&gt; (or manifesto, whichever you prefer). I'm glad people are seeing this as an enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I want &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of them. I want people to feel that it's an essential part of WordPress, for writers. The writer's web. Remember that, you'll be hearing a lot about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There's also an API that comes with WordLand, I'll be talking more about that later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in the browser.</description>

			<description>I did a restoration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.userland.com/&quot;&gt;discuss.userland.com&lt;/a&gt;, the discussion group for scripting.com between 1998 and 2001. I think now finally it works. If you find anything interesting in the archive, send me a link. A lot of the early blogs started from discussions there, heated at times. But a lot of good stuff came from it.</description>
