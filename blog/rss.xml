			<description>We should try &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opml.org/issues/22#issuecomment-2211828371&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; someday: A twitter-like system built with feeds, with all their limits. People can link to my posts, but not attach themselves to my flow. Goodbye spam and the motive for abuse, attention. Something I'd like to try someday, but first you need people who are interested. It's a chicken and egg thing.</description>

			<description>I cancelled my NYT subscription. They can't hear their readers. It's time for a new journalism, and we're going to have to do it without them. I haven't cancelled my Washington Post subscription yet, but I'm pretty sure that's coming soon enough.</description>

			<title>The SF newspaper strike of 1994</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/06/theSanFranciscoNewspaperStrikeOf1994.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I tell the story of the move from print to the web in 1994 when the San Francisco newspapers went on strike. I was part of that process, a step in the bootstrap that led to the social web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about that process as journalism system is losing its mind, like everything else, and we need to find a way to flow intelligent news to people who need it, so we can start to organize, and we need to do it &lt;i&gt;now. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The flow are out there, smart people who know stuff and have ideas, but they aren't getting heard amidst the mindlessness of the NYT, CNN, MSNBC et al. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a long story, and it starts off crisp like most of my stories and then rambles out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;16 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This year I'm thinking how we can boot up a source of news that has the balance we deserve. Now that the Supreme Court is no longer keeping up any pretense of respecting the Constitution, and journalism is either colluding, or preparing for their meeting with a military tribunal in March next year, followed by, if lucky, a re-education camp, we need help knowing what's real and what's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I hear that cancelling a NYT subscription is wicked hard. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;alone&lt;/a&gt; makes me feel like cancelling. I cancelled their morning email of things I need to know about. It's one thing for them to exclusively report on Biden's age in their space, but my mailbox is mine.

I wonder if anyone else does that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The title of this episode is &quot;A peneer of legitimacy,&quot; but what I really meant is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_veneer&quot;&gt;veneer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I describe a dream where the owner of the NY Times is, in March 2025, being tried by a military tribunal for not sufficiently helping Trump get re-elected as he was told to do. Sulzberger, in his own defense, points out that they covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Biden%27s+Age&quot;&gt;Biden's Age&lt;/a&gt;, the official new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Hillary%27s+Emails&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt;, while ignoring other possible issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tribunal returns with its verdict and hilarity ensues as the punishment, secret until revealed, is administered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The crowd goes crazy! &quot;Too late! Not enough! Go to hell!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The host of the show is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Simpson&quot;&gt;Bart Simpson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We go into that in the second episode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not enough to win the election. We have to get the Supreme Court back to a semblance of what it was. They're behaving in a way that's inconsistent with the continued existence of the country they're supposed to be part of the government of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we can have a laugh along the way.

			<title>Plan for Biden re Supreme Court</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a lightly edited version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C864lCsuwbK&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Threads. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I understand why the Dems don't want to be the first to use the new rule passed by the Supreme Court, but I think they should consider this plan:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Arrest the members of the Supreme Court who just voted for the new rule about presidential immunity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nominate six replacements, sorry no Repubs this time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Senate ratifies them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Once they're installed, they hold an emergency session to restore Roe v Wade, and to undo all the other crazy BS they did and then revoke the new rule, and re-assert the rule of law that &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; applies to the president.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And I don't know what they do with the ones they arrested but frankly I don't care. Leave them in jail until they figure it out.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it's about time Trump was arrested and held without bail, so he can't do any more damage to the US while awaiting trial. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@palafo&quot;&gt;Patrick LaForge&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime friend who works at the NYT: &quot;I think the distinction here is that the president can't be prosecuted for violations of law but they would still be acts unsupported by law that a court could block or an agency could refuse to carry out. But they sure have created a mess.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C87TO13pkO_&quot;&gt;My response&lt;/a&gt;: Maybe starting to do it is enough to get the courts to undo the mess asap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Our challenge is to make sure the really interesting stuff happens on the open web, outside the silos. If that happens we can go on. Otherwise we go right back to where we were when Twitter and Facebook dominated. Not a good place. 17 years of stagnation</description>

You can now go directly to the OPML version of a blogroll, and to the HTML page we discovered it in. I know all this must seem strange, hard to figure out what's going on. That's how I feel about it too. But I know there's interesting data here, how people are connected to people. I'm still trying to figure out how to make a browser that engages the mind in that. It can take a long time to figure these things out. I had the basic idea for a blog in 1994, but it wasn't until 1999 that we really had it figured out and implemented for non-techies. This may be like that, or the browser might be just around the corner.</description>

			<title>Jeff Jarvis and Dave in conversation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just did an approx 40 minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/jeffJarvisDiscusses.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; interview and discussion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;. I know Jeff from the early days of blogging. He was one of the best discussion leaders at BloggerCon. And he's an accomplished author and educator. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We talk about how to organize news for people who are information starved by whatever it is that our news sources are doing, which is really hard to figure out, but in the end (I argue) who cares why, we have a problem to solve, so let's get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I talk about the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, that's how they got around journalism. I'm sure that's where we have to go, put together what we think would be the Biden blog if the campaign was being run by Joe and Nicco, and I'd be on board, so would Jeff, and we'd help Heather Cox Richardson, and amplify anyone who is making sense and supports democracy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could be funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/01/1342.html&quot;&gt;People's PAC&lt;/a&gt;, or something like it. It wouldn't take very much money, it's just a blog. But it would have powerful ideas that cut through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/03/bullshit.m4a&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;, and great videos, and we'd organize marches where people show up to help people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the campaign would never stop, we'd always be organizing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the discussion I wanted to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Jeff's mike is much better than mine. Gotta work on that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
