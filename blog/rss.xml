			<title>WordPress for identity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't believe a product like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; should do its own identity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Identity is one of those things you totally want centralized, because that's the benefit of identity -- you can be the same person in a lot of different places. And if we work that out well, the apps that you connect with that way can work with each other in interesting ways to provide new integrations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always been preaching this, let developers and users do the integration, let software developers create basic capability that we can wire together any way we like. That was what we were doing on the Mac platform in the 1988-92. And also what we've been doing on the web since 1994 . It's an idea as old as &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mamrak.1/CIS762/pipes_lab_notes.html&quot;&gt;Unix pipes&lt;/a&gt;. But it requires cooperation among developers, which we have seen sometimes happens. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/226&quot;&gt;WordPress for identity&lt;/a&gt; is a step in that direction. The hope is it could form a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone&quot;&gt;backbone&lt;/a&gt; for an internet of applications. I'm willing to step up and say okay let's give this a try and see what happens.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>FeedLand's identity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to visualize &lt;i&gt;FeedLand&lt;/i&gt; to work toward a great logo for it, and had the idea of playing with ChatGPT and DALL-E to see what would come of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I painted a verbal picture of a yacht in a port on the Adriatic, the water is choppy but the yacht is doing well. On the main sail would be the words FEED and LAND. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what it came up with and it's better than anything I imagined. Really. The art is all over this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/03/feedLandAsYacht.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;FeedLand as a yacht.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Doc in Berkeley in 2006</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm helping my friends at Automattic make &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt; easier to read, esp on tablets which is where I end up reading most of his writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also never liked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/02/docblogpic.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; someone put on Doc's blog. I guess if you squint it kind of looks like Doc, but that isn't how I see him.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/292425043&quot;&gt;This picture&lt;/a&gt;, which I took at a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@37.8909372,-122.2875094,3a,75y,313.36h,69.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1suaMTkzX9fdF13_oSiid1mw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;breakfast place&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2006/11/08.html&quot;&gt;Nov 8, 2006&lt;/a&gt;, is much more what I think of when I think of Doc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So is it fair to use a picture that's 17 years old? Sure! Most of the stuff on his blog was written then or before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/02/docInBerkeleyIn2006.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Doc in Berkeley in 2006 via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/292425043&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>DALL-E illustrated my story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a story ten years ago, posted only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0z317zwEGJKSRcLKR8b7acQeTCf6HhA8ZJsQcnwF3rLWEoGofBuqqtrjkohMyPsUbl&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A plot for a science fiction horror movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Takes place in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A young Zuck-like hacker not only understands how to write scalable server apps, and has no principles about people's privacy (or really anything, for that matter), he's also a lawyer. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He starts a Facebook-like service, but it's better in some way (still need to come up with this element), but there's a twist. The end user agreement is customized for each user. Not for everyone, just a few. They know where you live, and whether you own the house or not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the nasty thing they do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They plant seemingly innocuous language in the agreement (that no one reads anyway) that says you sign over all your property to them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Not sure where it goes from there exactly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Probably not all that great an idea.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visualized...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I fed this story to ChatGPT and asked it to ask DALL-E to visualize it. Had to change Zuck to Buck to get past its filters. And here's what it came back with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/01/buckbook.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;i&gt;BuckBook,&lt;/i&gt; by DALL-E, as directed by ChatGPT, screenplay by me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2125543310986396&amp;set=a.113966572144090&amp;notif_id=1698842698080932&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;Full-size visual&lt;/a&gt;, on Facebook -- seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
