			<description>I'd like to have an OPML subscription list with feeds with news about specific feed-based products. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/21&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple repo&lt;/a&gt; for people to post links to such feeds. Once I have enough feeds, I'll publish the URL of the subscription list. We should, in this community, of all communities, a good way to communicate about developments. Too many good ideas get lost without this.</description>

			<description>I think the really big money in AI will be helping all the commerce sites get competitive again. Their sites are breaking, and are anemic compared to what you can do with AI. I think the WordPress community is in great position to get a huge amount of business here because many of these people are your customers. If you're a WordPress developer I'd love to hear what you think.</description>

			<description>I've taught ChatGPT and Claude.ai how to properly indent code so I can paste it into my outliner, and it will represent the structure correctly.

			<description>They all say podcasting‘s open period is over and one or another huge billionaire-owned platform is the new owner of podcasting. This time it's YouTube. How many times has this happened? Many. But not enough for journalism to respect the power of the people. So here we go again.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Brainerd&quot;&gt;Paul Brainerd&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of Aldus, publisher of Pagemaker, died.

Pagemaker was a milestone product, it was the first popular desktop publishing app on the Mac, the first to really make use of the graphic OS and laser printing. We worked with Aldus on scripting via Frontier. The ability to automate Pagemaker and then Quark XPress (its main competitor) was very important in the prepress market. I once said no one wants that (referring to Pagemaker) just shows how little I know. There are good reasons to believe that one product saved the Mac and Apple.</description>

			<description>Just noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ranchero.com/2026/02/17/new-rss-reader-current.html&quot;&gt;Brent mentioned FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; (my own product) that does things differently. Thank you. I don't read most of the pieces that come in via RSS. I scroll through the updates, and if something catches my eye, I stop, read the first part, and then if my interest continues, I read the rest. That's the way I've always read news, going back to the kitchen table at my childhood home where we subscribed to the NY Times, print edition (this was long before the web) and we all sat around the table in the morning reading it and telling each other what we found. News isn't like email. But FeedLand does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ffeed%2Fall%2F&quot;&gt;mailbox reader&lt;/a&gt;, patterned after Brent's NetNewsWire (only steal from the best). There are times when that's what you want. And mostly I wanted to thank Brent for the mention. BTW, that's not the only new idea in FeedLand. Let's get to know each others' products. That's one of the mistakes we made last time -- thinking each of our products was a self-contained universe. We are part of a community that grew from the web. So by definition we are all just part of a very big world. All our products work together, and to preserve that we as people must all &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt; too.</description>

That's the way I've always read news, going back to the kitchen table at my childhood home where we subscribed to the NY Times, print edition (this was long before the web) and we all sat around the table in the morning reading it and telling each other what we found. News isn't like email. But FeedLand does have a [mailbox reader](https://feedland.com/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ffeed%2Fall%2F), patterned after Brent's NetNewsWire (only steal from the best). There are times when that's what you want. And mostly I wanted to thank Brent for the mention. BTW, that's not the only new idea in FeedLand. Let's get to know each others' products. That's one of the mistakes we made last time -- thinking each of our products was a self-contained universe. We are part of a community that grew from the web. So by definition we are all just part of a very big world. All our products work together, and to preserve that we as people must all **work together** too.</source:markdown>

			<title>The Spurlocks of RSS-Land</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a product announcement from Jake Spurlock -- a new feed reader called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakespurlock.com/2026/02/today-comes-to-the-mac/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;. From the description sounds well-thought-out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He explains -- &quot;Google killed Reader in 2013. I've been chasing that feeling ever since. So I built it.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also know someone named &lt;i&gt;John&lt;/i&gt; Spurlock, who I &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22john%20spurlock%22&quot;&gt;worked on&lt;/a&gt; some OPML and RSS stuff for Bluesky in 2023. I sent a note of congrats to him, when I really should've sent it to Jake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/18/spurlockScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the conversation I had with ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And text of the email I sent congratulating the wrong Spurlock.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the new product!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Haven't tried it yet, I don't generally use Apple's store on my Mac, not sure why. I will do it though.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your product looks nice and well-thought out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And there are some ways we could work together now that I think you'll find interesting, like using FeedLand to get you instant updates based on rssCloud, assuming you haven't figured out how to support it from a client. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also OPML subscriptions are nice too. Another thing I'd like to get going, and need someone to work with on to make it happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I wonder if they're related? Have they met each other? Do they know of the havoc they are bringing to the formerly simple world of RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20171005153425/http://forewordbootstrap.blorkmark.com/&quot;&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bootstrap-Responsive-Development-Jake-Spurlock/dp/1449343910&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; Jake Spurlock wrote for O'Reilly about the Bootstrap Toolkit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Maybe they worked at one time. I used ChatGPT as I often do to get help on one of these antiquated sites.

If they start spending more money than a subscription costs, you could offer a subscription then, as a way to save money. Kind of the way Amazon lets you buy a certain amount of coffee beans without requiring you to sign up for monthly delivery. They do tell you how much you'd save if you subscribed. Everyone appreciates a chance to save money, but still might not want the commitment. And asking someone from upstate NY to subscribe to the Atlanta Journal Constitution is a total bullshit.

It's much easier to write utility scripts, where the user writes the code for themselves. That is very possible, esp if you use a scripting language created for it, and the AI bots are really good at that, they speak the same language we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But to make something easy to use by humans, I think you actually have to be a human.

That was a long time ago, and it did not work out that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>New RSS feature from Manton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I asked Manton Reece if he could add a feature that gave me a feed of replies to me on his service, micro.blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I post a lot of stuff to micro.blog via my linkblog RSS feed. Every one of those items can be commented on. But unless I visit micro.blog regularly, I don't see the comments. I guess people have mostly figured out that I'm an absent poster, and don't say anything. Even so, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; some replies. Wouldn't it be great if the responses could show up in my blogroll. And of course if there was an RSS feed of the replies, I would see them when I was looking for something possibly interesting, one of the main reasons I have a blogroll, and keep finding new uses for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The feed is &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/16/blogrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; now, I'm subscribed and new comments are posted in the feed and Murphy-willing I will see them.  &lt;i&gt;Bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/feeds/dave/mentions.xml&quot;&gt;https://micro.blog/feeds/dave/mentions.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a killer feature for sure. But the best part of it is this -- here are two developers working together. This is how the web works when it's working. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW a suggestion. Right now the title on my feed is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Micro.blog - dave mentions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a problem in the limited horizontal space in the blogroll. A more useful title would be: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;dave&quot; mentions on micro.blog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you were building a social network out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; this would be an essential feature. It also validates Manton's intuition to allow people like me to be absentee publishers to his community. But the missing piece was allowing the conversation to be two-way, which it now is. That deserves another &lt;i&gt;bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reducing tab clutter in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, when I get too many tabs open from things I haven't looked at in a while, this is what I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I choose Add Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The menu opens with the new bookmark at the top of the list&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it's the first time I press Return and enter &quot;Tabs I Closed Recently&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I drag the new bookmark under that headline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Close the Bookmarks tab.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remove the tab I just bookmarked.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Voila!

			<source:markdown>In [Drummer](http://drummer.land/), when I get too many tabs open from things I haven't looked at in a while, this is what I do.&#10;&#10;1.  I choose Add Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu&#10;2.  The menu opens with the new bookmark at the top of the list&#10;3.  If it's the first time I press Return and enter &quot;Tabs I Closed Recently&quot;&#10;4.  Then I drag the new bookmark under that headline.&#10;5.  Close the Bookmarks tab.&#10;6.  Remove the tab I just bookmarked.&#10;7.  Voila! Clutter Reduced.</source:markdown>

			<title>Ideas for the fediverse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Bullet items for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fediforum.org/2026-03-growing-open-social-web/&quot;&gt;Fediforum conference&lt;/a&gt; in March.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Subscribing must be easy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some things will work better if they're slightly centralized, esp subscribing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use DNS for naming people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Support RSS in and out, and test it once you add the feature, so many easy things to fix remain broken (like titles of the feeds, look terrible in a list of feed titles). RSS is how you earn the &quot;web&quot; in your name. &quot;Web&quot; means something, it's just an intention, there are rules. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't need &quot;open&quot; if you have &quot;web.&quot; The web is by definition open. Water is wet. Raises question re what the not-open web is. (Silo.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Support the basic features of text in the web. If you shut off the writing features of the web, as Twitter did, you're not really part of the web. Especially linking.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Listen to users, listen to other developers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Automattic is doing heroic work connecting WordPress to ActivityPub. This means that WordPress APIs are now ActivityPub APIs. Not a small thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Look at text coming out of WordPress into Mastodon, the HTML used definitely could be improved.

Every once in a while I get reports from people who looked something up on my blog's &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=NaN&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; search engine saying that where they expected dates they see things like this: NaN. The reason you see that is that the archive has a mistake in it, where there was supposed to be a date there was something else. Usually I shrug it off, yes there are mistakes in the archive, 30+ years of OPML files, it's a miracle there aren't more errors.

Provide the term and a screen shot of what you saw. And then other people who have some extra time, could look through the archive, find the post, and then show me what needs to be fixed. I would then fix it, and over time the archive would get fixed. I posted a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/350&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the Scripting News repo, if you want to help, bookmark that link, and when you see an error, post the note and we can get going.</description>

I have no way of knowing if anyone has commented on them, but if there were a feed I'd add it to my blogroll. So it would be great to have a feed of all the comments on my posts on micro.blog. Would fit into my flow perfectly.

No links. So guess what the Back button one of the best inventions ever, isn't part of your reading and writing world. I guess this is like the street cars in LA &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy&quot;&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, that the car companies bought and shut down?</description>

			<description>To my WordPress developer friends. How about making the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/14/rssfeed.png&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; prettier and easier to read. Properly indenting it would make a big diff. I prefer encoding individual characters to CDATA. Those two things to start. It really does matter how readable this stuff is. Comparison, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt; generates, the software that renders my blog.</description>

			<description>It's all-star weekend in the NBA which I've never seen the point of. As if sport is anything but a simulation of what we were born to do -- compete and cooperate. My team is great, your team sucks. It's fun the same way slapstick for some weird reason is funny. All it takes to get a laugh is trip and fall on your face. It's funny just thinking about it. Doesn't seem very nice but there it is.</description>

			<description>One more thing and then I gotta go. I think it's time for the AI's to compete with Wikipedia. It's filled with hallucinations. Make it a community thing, let the people be involved, but do a better job of presentation, and validate what's written, don't let these things become so territorial. We want the facts, not who has the best PR.</description>

When I first put them on and played something I had a jolt. The sound appeared to be blasting from the speaker on my laptop. I rushed to try to turn it down and realized it was in my head. Never been so impressed. They don't go inside your ear, the speaker is poised above the ear. Later when I got out of my car and the headphones automatically connected via Bluetooth -- it was a podcast -- I thought the person was talking to me on the street in the middle of nowhere. I laughed at now I had been tricked so thoroughly, twice. It keeps happening. Music is incredible. The best sound I've ever heard from headphones. So totally worth the money.</description>

			<description>When I was a kid I had a penpal in Scotland. It was kind of interesting but after a while it became tiresome. One time I got a letter from my penpal with the usual stuff, school, sports, the Beatles, other kids, but this time there was no mention about how stupid the adults were. I found out why at the end in a PS. &quot;Sometimes my mom writes these for me.&quot; Obviously I never forgot this.</description>

			<description>I no longer even think of debating whether the AIs are intelligent. I might as well argue about your intelligence, or even my own. We have no idea what intelligence is or how to test for it. So if you think you're so intelligent and you say things like &quot;AIs aren't intelligent&quot; as if it were an indisputable fact, well I'm pretty sure that proves you are not actually very intelligent, which indicates how intelligent I am (not). And if you're worried about what happens if you stop insisting that AIs aren't intelligent, you can relax, nothing depends on what you or I or anyone else thinks about that, or pretty much anything. Have a nice day.</description>

I think every news org should have one of those, to tell your readers who you read. Work together, we need it as we reboot the news.

			<description>I just watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Our_Planet&quot;&gt;Life on Our Planet&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80213846&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, loved it. Lots of takeaways, but this one will surprise you probably -- I think the AIs are our successors. We should at least try to preserve them so they can run on the Moon if we're in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction&quot;&gt;6th Mass Extinction&lt;/a&gt;, which of course we are. There's been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/life-on-our-planet/&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleontology/comments/17q31z6/why_does_everyone_hate_life_on_our_planet_so_much/&quot;&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; of the show, but it got me to think about evolution not necessarily in the terms they offer, but the scale of it. And the CGIs were fantastic.</description>
