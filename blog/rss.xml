			<description>My guess is that every billionaire is going to try to compete with Musk, maybe some will join together. If you know how to write a TWTR get busy.</description>

			<description>AWS should have, long ago, written a faceless TWTR clone, and let a million flowers bloom. As with many other things, I beat the drum ceaselessly for this, as far as I know they never heard me.</description>

			<description>That's why it was interesting to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1518734031566778368&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; poke Elon Musk  in the eye last night. That's exactly the kind of thing a competitor would say, and the fact that he said it so publicly, on TWTR, says he's going to do it. He wants to reserve the space in our minds.</description>

			<description>Another thought, making a federated twitter will be hard. No one knows how to do it. But I bet a lot of people know how to clone twitter. That's the way this will go. And we should make sure all these clones can peer with each other. I'm available to help with this.</description>

The Nets might've fared better if at least some of NY's long-suffering Knicks fans were behind them. But this team has no idea what NY is, and our relationship with basketball, and our Knicks, who we love like family. It doesn't matter if KD thinks they're cool, and if you think that matters, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518880919762919424&quot;&gt;you can have&lt;/a&gt; the Nets. But last night's crowd at Barclay were mostly pulling for the Celtics, and that's a shame. It tells you how much the owners of and players for the Nets have to learn about the city that they are supposedly playing for. And btw, forget about a cross-town rivalry. You might want to see if the arena y'all were using in NJ is still available.</description>

			<description>Why Musk bought Twitter: There’s tremendous value that does not show up on a balance sheet. He was smart enough to see it, gutsy enough to buy it, and had the means to do it.</description>

			<title>Peering</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad&quot;&gt;Golden Spike&lt;/a&gt; was a very simple form of peering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was a rail system in the east, and one developing in the west. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So in the middle of the Civil War if you can believe that, they started building a branch from each to meet up somewhere in the middle. And then you could ride a train from New York to San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering&quot;&gt;Peering&lt;/a&gt; means you can get from one system onto another. Peering is what makes the internet the internet. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's past time we built another layer on the net. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The packet basically will be an &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;item&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from an RSS feed. A title, simple styled text, links, enclosures. A very simple concept, well-understood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It'd be a shame not to plan this out now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A big patch of blue sky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518701984265687045&quot;&gt;last night&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, when I unexpectedly felt pretty sad about what had happened. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter inherited the blogosphere, in a sense, and the chaos of the company hid the fact that it was owned, all that we put into it, we owned none of it. It could all be sold. Now it’s glaring.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Although Twitter was never a living thing, it feels like something died, in an instant, unexpected, shock, the end. When Jerry Garcia died, also suddenly, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“Like the big tree that fell last March, the death of a huge human being like Jerry Garcia frees up a huge amount of space. Once there was a tree, now there are seedlings. After the sadness, there will be huge creativity.“&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That’s my wish. With this passing, a big patch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22&quot;&gt;blue sky&lt;/a&gt; opens.

			<title>The latest news from MuskLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of talk on Twitter today about what to do if Elon Musk ends up owning Twitter. Based on an article in the WSJ, it appears that might happen very soon, maybe even later today. The Twitter board is carefully studying the offer. Presumably after looking at their lack of success of getting Twitter to grow like other tech industry social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1518559177093926912&quot;&gt;Benedict Evans&lt;/a&gt; described Twitter as the  &quot;Craigslist of Web 2.0, coasting on network effects, building nothing much, and getting unbundled piece by piece.&quot; I think that's a good synopsis of the last decade or so in TwitterLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally there's a lot of discussion about where we'll go, which is good. We could have been talking about this long ago, and be more independent of Twitter now. But this is when people get creative. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1518574700611264513&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; suggests we all go back to Tumblr, presumably where she started blogging. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518575186383101952&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;Let's all go back to what we like, and meet up in the middle.&quot; Honestly I think that's what Musk must be thinking of. Unbundling Twitter. Turning it into an identity system and an aggregator of lots of sources of bite-size ideas from all kinds of people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1518559637553008644&quot;&gt;Evans suggests&lt;/a&gt;, as do many others. that the moderation problem on Twitter is insurmountable. I don't think it actually is. My Tesla car can drive it self, somewhat, with my assistance, guidance and supervision. Couldn't an algorithmic approach to moderation work just as well? If we're willing to trust our bodies to an algorithm, why not moderation? I think the problem is solvable. Musk's other companies solve bigger problems adequately. Amazon can deliver packages to millions of addresses in the US every day. I just don't think Twitter's are that much harder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Musk has shown himself to have a childish personality, I can't imagine people who are serious about doing hard jobs are willing to work for him, but apparently enough are to make SpaceX and Tesla very successful companies. A paradox I expect we'll learn a lot more about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said to Jeff Jarvis yesterday that we need a Plan B. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I suspect if Musk buys Twitter, we'll all get used to grumbling about him, and Twitter will continue to work more or less, and will gradually improve over time, as basic software development principles, which have evolved over many decades, will get Twitter growing and actually doing new things, which will be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I am a Twitter developer and shareholder. As a shareholder, I don't want to sell out. Just thought I should get all that on the record. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I own a Tesla Model 3 and a StarLink dish. I'm very happy with both products, so far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: In the early blogosphere I wrote about them watching them watch us watch them watch us, watch them watch us, watch them, etc. Same old same old. The more things change the more they stay the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPS: A lot of people are saying they will leave Twitter if Musk buys it. I've been through this before. Very few if any will leave. It's why I have this motto: &quot;Don't slam the door on the way out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPPS: Finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html&quot;&gt;at 3PM&lt;/a&gt;, the age of MuskTwitter has begun. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518666782608867329&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There weren't many people rooting for the Nets in the arena. There was a lot more enthusiasm for the Celtics, because they're an exciting team and they're going somewhere. Boston is close and NYC is so huge there are already a fair number of Celtics fans here. Today's Nets don't have a home court. They haven't sold the idea of the Nets to the NBA fans here. NYC is huge, even a team without much of a following should be able to fill the arena with enthusiasm. But Kevin Durant, the leader of the team, the reason the Nets are supposedly contenders, never approached the city as something he had to win over. They must've thought fans are simple. They loved me in Oklahoma and Oakland, of course they'll love me here. I don't think anyone in particular loved KD in Oakland, they do love Curry, Thompson and Green. KD was a carpetbagger in Oakland as he is in NYC. He came to the city with disrespect for NBA fans here. He could have said hey it's great to be in NY, love the energy of Knicks fans, I hope some of you will come out to see the Nets. That would've been appropriate. Instead he disses the Knicks, the Garden and by implication those of us who have suffered with the Knicks all these years. Yeah we know they suck, but we &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; them. They're family. You don't get to dis them. So this is the price. No one here cares if this year's Nets win. And some of us want them to lose. At this point it seems unless there's a miracle, the Nets are eliminated. If he's going to stick around KD should ask for a reboot with Knicks fans. Forget about a crosstown rivalry. For now the Knicks own the city, even if they suck. Ask for our support. You might get it next time you're in the playoffs. But you'll have to earn it by showing up in our city in the meantime.</description>

			<title>Ugh Musk</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was kind of in favor of Musk running Twitter, but this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/23/disturbingImage.png&quot;&gt;disturbing image&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/23/disturbingImage.png&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Body shaming sucks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Gates is smart, a powerful person. I don't see why he'd want to blow him off like this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't want Musk having power over me, even though I guess he does already.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What I want to hear: Audio of Trump talking with Congress people from the White House, in the Capitol, while the riot was taking place. I want to hear the fear in their voices, and the pathology in Trump's. If the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/21.html#a021116&quot;&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; have that audio, release it now.</description>

			<description>I'm working my way through Paul McCartney's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)&quot;&gt;first solo album&lt;/a&gt;. It was as big an event in 1970 as Elon Musk tweeting that he wanted to acquire Twitter in 2022. The album amounted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Press_release_and_the_Beatles'_break-up&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that the Beatles were broken up. In fact, Lennon had already quit the group, but hadn't announced it publicly. But it's a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; album. I listened the hell out of it when I was a teen and in my 20s, but never really &lt;i&gt;listened&lt;/i&gt; to it if you know what I mean. Like try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCppWWmIGQ&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; out. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. So much to listen to. And he did the album, in secret, and on really low tech hardware with no mixing board. Just four tracks straight to tape. Much more lightly produced than Beatles songs, no grand George Martin productions, just McCartney and that's worth something.</description>

It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondlife.com/&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;. And Second Life was boring. All kinds of people said it was the next big thing, but they were people who generally didn't correctly spot big tech things. But there are life simulations that did catch on. I loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity&quot;&gt;SimCity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims&quot;&gt;The Sims&lt;/a&gt;. Poured endless hours into them. The difference is that they are third person and Second Life was first person. In The Sims you get to play god. It must not be a lot of fun for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/22/sims.png&quot;&gt;virtual people&lt;/a&gt; in The Sims, but it sure is fun to play god. Maybe Zuck should check that out. An online system where everyone gets to be a tech trillionaire with a massive family &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/23/mark-zuckerberg-hawaii-land-lawsuits-kauai-estate&quot;&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii and nukes (like Putin) and you get to do whatever you want with the poor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schnook&quot;&gt;schnooks&lt;/a&gt; (who aren't actual people, btw). That's where the &lt;i&gt;virtual&lt;/i&gt; in virtual reality is fun, when you get to be Elon Musk and own your own Twitter for example. Isn't that the dream we all had as kids, that we'd grow up and then we'd show them. I used to have images of my father, locked in a tiny bathroom, with a bowl of spaghetti poured on his head. I would say to him &quot;You're staying in there until you learn some manners, young man!&quot; It was a nice dream then, truthfully it still is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'd love to see some publication do a comparison of legal cannabis in various different states. How does the quality compare, prices? What states have public places like bars and coffee shops where it's legal to hang out and consume as in Amsterdam (where it's not legal, I know, but tolerated). New Jersey just opened yesterday, and I was interested in seeing how prices compare to those in Massachusetts. Too early to draw any conclusions. But I can tell you that it's way more expensive than in Washington or Oregon.</description>

			<description>We should just discount the president's approval rating down to zero and then we could view 39% as a historic high. But seriously folks, the president's approval rating is just how the news, as it's reported, bounces off the minds of the people the pollsters talk to. You could model it like they model weather reports, and tune up the news coverage to create any approval rating you want.</description>

			<description>We're curing ourselves from Covid the way people who smoke while they quit smoking aren't actually quitting. To quit, you stop. If you take your masks off, that's like buying a pack of cigarettes, and having one or two and then finishing the pack and then getting another. I speak as an ex-smoker for over 30 years. I had all kinds of plans for quitting, but the only way to do it is to quit. We'll never get out of the Covid hole until &lt;i&gt;all of us&lt;/i&gt; commit to it and then follow through. Otherwise it's going to continue to be a lingering tragedy.</description>

My face feels naked without it. The other day I went into the supermarket without a mask and had to go back out to the car to get one. In that moment I got to think about why I wear a mask even when others aren't. It's because I want to send a message to my fellow shoppers that I care about their health. I was raised to be a considerate person. So many people were raised to be self-centered and pissy. I never want to see myself that way. Anyway it was really annoying how quickly the airlines took down their mask requirements. I suggest if you want to make your feelings known to them, stop flying until they bring the mandates back.</description>
