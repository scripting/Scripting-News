			<description>BTW, in case you're wondering where &quot;still diggin!&quot; came from -- here's the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it's a lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there's more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It's like &quot;even worse than it appears.&quot; Still diggin is meant to say we know it's really futile, you don't have to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we feel somehow that next time it really will work. It's a Vonnegut-like or Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other words, realistic.</description>

			<description>I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted to be a writer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker&quot;&gt;Russell Baker&lt;/a&gt;. I was quoted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; in an op-ed. I have done some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html&quot;&gt;most successful work&lt;/a&gt; of my career with the NYT. I love journalism &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;like I love the Mets&lt;/a&gt;. I don't expect them to do great things every season, but I do hope for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; every once in a while. These days I don't have much hope for the NYT returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up in Queens in the 1960s. We &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing.</description>

			<title>How we learn to art</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it any other way? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever invented just to make something new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of that in software, people won't put in an API so you have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can make progress when people don't try to lock up their ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Individuals live just a short time, we can't do that much in a lifetime, but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and we build. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/selfportrait.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We learn by studying ourselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why shouldn't our machines be able to learn too? They already can do things vastly more complex than we can. We've invented a huge lever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar Galactica. But those are stories, they didn't happen. The future is rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has come before is now in our hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/weWillUseIt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We're going to use it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote the words, ChatGPT did the images. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If the Democrats had a sense of the moment they'd run the campaign on a plan to regain control of the House and keep the Senate and White House so we can pass a law that legalizes abortion in the whole country. Give people a positive reason to elect a governing majority. Think powerfully.</description>

			<title>Biden &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a fine president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and proto-blogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just made it a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing about Gaza is that there's the rest of the world, and they're watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been such an asshole to the US. He's a freaking MAGA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure. The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there's another path, compassion and help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But they're doing it the only way we can, given who we are.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we never have. Journos seem to think Americans can't understand the basics of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn't really any more complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We need an analogous rule that says there should be no reporting on polls until after the election, to allow the people to form their own opinions, for the same reason. Also, people are less likely to vote if they feel the outcome is a foregone conclusion. People even form their decision re who to vote for based on the polls. That's not a very healthy way for a country to govern itself.</description>

			<description>The big deal with ChatGPT is that it's a huge improvement over search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the pieces together. I don't care how it does it, it's a much higher level tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a computer.</description>

			<description>When I was a grad student in Comp Sci, I was a teaching assistant for a class in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ece252.ece.wisc.edu/ch07_inclass_01_assembly_language.pdf&quot;&gt;assembly language&lt;/a&gt; programming for a couple of years. One of my responsibilities was to grade the work of the students. Later, I was the CEO and lead developer at a software company I founded, and there I had to review other people's source code. I was pretty fussy about writing understandable code, because it was my job in both places to understand their code, and I also knew, even when I was just a TA, how important it is that your code be human-readable, not just machine-readable. I just want to say if ChatGPT were a student of mine, its code would get an A+, with thanks from the teacher for making my life easier.</description>

I don't have an opinion about whether he will or won't have one, but for me, the process of putting this together in 2024 has been a really good thing. I'm better in touch with what other people are doing. My blogroll does more than it did 20 years ago. Actually it's a lot like his &lt;a href=&quot;https://sources.werd.io/&quot;&gt;Sources page&lt;/a&gt;, but more compact. I'm glad we're having this discussion. It's &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what I hoped would happen. And of course my feed list is behind my blogroll.</description>

			<title>Blogs for social web apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In a new product I'm working on, I'm including links to the blogs of the social media apps I use. I notice that most of them have one. This is why:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can put a title on a post on a blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can include links (invariably announcements have links).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can edit posts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Simple text styling.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blogs have feeds.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking for the official blogs of the social apps I use -- Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, Threads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If so, what's the feed URL? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It seems dumb to have two places for writing. &lt;s&gt;Also I bet Bluesky wrote their own blogging software, which is why there's no feed for their blog, which is awkward because Bluesky itself has feeds. As a programmer, I don't think I could maintain both codebases, and i'm pretty sure the blog is the one that'll get abandoned.&lt;/s&gt; Update: they do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294#issuecomment-1973571777&quot;&gt;have a feed&lt;/a&gt; for their blog.

That should be fixed to something like Twitter Blog. I know how this happens, obviously they're maintaining more than one language, so the title is given from their point of view.
