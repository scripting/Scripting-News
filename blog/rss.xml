The apps were offline until I could restart the server, and that sometimes meant hours of downtime.  That no longer happens. But now there's a different problem, sometimes I go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my news page&lt;/a&gt; on feedland.org and for a minute or so there's no response. Eventually I give up and try again in a new tab. Same thing. Eventually the problem clears and the server returns to it's normal performance. I'm starting to think about how I might isolate this problem. My theory is that the problem is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;appserver&lt;/a&gt; layer, not in FeedLand itself, because when it happens nothing is returned. If it were at a higher level, the lockup would be in the code that gets a timeline or feedlist or whatever, so you would see a menu at the top of the screen. But it's always the news page this happens on, come to think of it. Maybe I should start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/270&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on this in case other FeedLand users who are also developers (please) might have some ideas.</description>

			<description>It has been pointed out that I could use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/&quot;&gt;OpenAI platform&lt;/a&gt; to add commands to my outliner that are based on results of ChatGPT questions. For example, I could say (hypothetically) &quot;add a list for 10 random states under the bar cursor headline&quot; and it would be done. I hope to try that soon. In the meantime if you'd like to do it, the outliner I use is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, so you can do it, and share it with me and that would make me even happier. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Do I still use..?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Basically the answer is yes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have Facebook, Twitter, Bluesky, Masto1 and Masto2 in my browser chrome, and I check them roughly in that order.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since masto and bluesky have &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, the really important ones are in my main timeline in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't a political statement. No one cares which systems you use. I use these systems because the people there who I am connected to are interesting, or we have a personal relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People overestimate the value of their choices in social networks, as they also overestimate the value of their vote. Do what works for you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Albert Shanker in Woody Allen movies</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/1291023b-fd7e-4e48-b43e-79d8b025e0b8&quot;&gt;written by ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; at my request. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker&quot;&gt;Albert Shanker&lt;/a&gt;, the influential American labor leader and president of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), made unexpected cameo appearances in the form of references in two Woody Allen films.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the 1973 comedic sci-fi film “Sleeper”, Shanker is humorously alluded to as the man responsible for the apocalypse. When Allen’s character, Miles Monroe, is brought up to speed after being cryogenically frozen for 200 years, he learns that civilization fell when “Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead.” This jest exaggerated Shanker’s reputation as a contentious union leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later, in the 1977 romantic comedy “Annie Hall”, Shanker’s name emerges again when Allen’s character shares a humorous quip about two magazines merging to form “Dysentery”, recounting that he told the joke to Shanker.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both references underscore Shanker’s significant presence in the socio-political landscape of the 1970s, immortalizing him in cinematic satire.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why can't I have an editor that I can give ChatGPT commands to. I do it anyway, I just have to copy-paste the result into my editor. Couldn't it save me that step by being integrated, or even better if we had good standards for scriptable apps. We were getting started on that in 1990 when Apple blew it all up, btw. Just sayin.</description>

The interop we have with the web wasn't created by Googles or Mozillas or the EFF. The web was created by accident, when the tech industry of the early 1990s wasn't looking. And of course they've been trying ever since to dismantle the interop gift we got from the accidental network.&quot;</description>

The interop we have with the web wasn't created by Googles or Mozillas or the EFF. The web was created by accident, when the tech industry of the early 1990s wasn't looking.

			<description>People whose careers began after the advent of the open web probably have no idea what a miracle it is, and imho once it's gone, it'll never happen again. The BigCo's are too entrenched, and have nothing to gain from the freedom and interop it provided. I know, because I was there, and know what a wasteland tech was before the web, and how that changed in an instant when the web caught on. All of a sudden the Bigs couldn't stop us from creating the things we wanted to create.</description>

			<description>States should have to buy insurance against mass shootings, to fund health care for victims and damages to families of those killed. That would give them incentive to control factors that cause mass shootings. No room for the usual bs.</description>
