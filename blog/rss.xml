			<description>In a year or two it will be possible to create a perfect TV version of any person. No longer can you say any person has to die eventually and go away. And we can have anyone back we want.&#10;</description>

I thought this was the moment when it would all melt down. America's Reichstad Fire. If it were an episode of Mission Impossible or Batman, it would definitely have gone that way. I bet there were plans hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I was also surprised there weren't any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday's parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump, rather it's TV President &quot;Taco&quot; Trump. I think they had a plan and he lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That's a line that hadn't yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It's here.</description>

			<title>Some media is for relaxation</title>

He's relaxing white noise, chatting in the background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode of media consumption. I'm always on the hunt for that kind of content. That's why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out, knowing they'll replay the best stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds of a meeting we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman&quot;&gt;Berkman&lt;/a&gt; in the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened public radio (didn't turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good use of podcasting). One of the guys from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prx.org/&quot;&gt;PRX&lt;/a&gt; which was also incubating there at the time, said at me in a challenging way -- You get the best info from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a good question. No, I said, it's relaxing, I can tune out while I'm driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it's so true. Now it's great when there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; that really &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief&quot;&gt;catches&lt;/a&gt; your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There must be a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that's when you really have to start worrying! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually. Distribute the content from the public radio sources that generate too much to the ones in less populated areas where they don't generate enough. Podcasting blew that up -- but PRX adjusted their approach, and became a distributor of podcasting. That's an entrepreneur's approach. The were able to pivot and continue to make a contribution to this day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I often wonder how we missed the opportunity to build a great media incubator at Harvard in the 00s. We were right there, and the backer of Berkman wanted entrepreurial projects, I found out at the reunion two summers ago. We had it, were there, if only.. Heh when you get to be my age there's lots of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I wonder how I missed the potential of WordPress all those years. Ships passing in the night.

It could cure the revulsion some voters feel for Democratic wokeness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; was never tried or convicted of any crime, or voted out of office by the state assembly or senate in Albany. Or the people of the State of New York. Al Franken wasn't allowed to have his case adjudicated by a committee of Congress. Both were pushed from office by journalism, which imho needs to be put in their place, they've been sloshing into lanes they weren't elected to. Let me try to make this clear. Journalism's role is to inform us of events. Once informed, it's their responsibility to stop. Anything past that is campaigning, not news. Step back and let the process run its course. Ultimately it's the people who will decide. Now, if Cuomo wins, this is the best outcome possible because the NYT et al will complain endlessly about how the Democrats just elected someone who they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gi9zFRBCIM&quot;&gt;don't approve of&lt;/a&gt;. This will probably get the Dems more votes in coming elections, because there are a lot of people who legitimately are disgusted by the NYT trying to run the show. If you want to govern, run for office. If you want to be a journalist, know when it's time to shut up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW isn't it amazing that when you say something counter to Democratic dogma, their first impulse is to try to destroy you? If the Dems were a healthy political party and not a religion, their first impulse would be to try to work with you not destroy you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who me?&quot; asks the Democrat. Yes, you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll know who the next leader of the Democratic Party is because they will be campaigning against the Democratic Party. Talking about things that actually happened rather than the hallucinations the Trumpies indulge in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Before doing that I tried to figure out what a linkblog is. I have been using various homebrew linkblogging tools which I have shared with others, but none of them became popular products. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/linkblog/&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; to help guide the development work I have planned.</description>

			<description>I was lucky to grow up in NYC, and had to commute from Queens to the Bronx every day to go to school. Some days I took the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bustime.mta.info/m/?q=Q44-SBS&amp;l=&quot;&gt;Q44&lt;/a&gt; bus over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx%E2%80%93Whitestone_Bridge&quot;&gt;Whitestone Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and other days I took the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bustime.mta.info/m/index;jsessionid=9F7ADE234676D22B101A192CAA31C55E?q=Q16&amp;l=&amp;t=&amp;cacheBreaker=1717915338805&quot;&gt;Q16&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;7 train&lt;/a&gt; through Manhattan, and then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;D trains&lt;/a&gt; up to 205th St in the Bronx. Took the same amount of time either way. So at age 15 I was able to go see the Grateful Dead after school at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillmore_East&quot;&gt;Fillmore East&lt;/a&gt; on April 27, 1971. Midway through the set, a special guest band who they didn't introduce started tuning up on stage. We all wondered who they were. I now know the history thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=500+Songs+podcast+beach+boys&quot;&gt;500 Songs podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and this was the return of a band that had fallen out of favor, a band whose hits we all heard on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC_(AM)#The_Musicradio_77_era_(1960%E2%80%931982)&quot;&gt;WABC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#%22Where_Rock_Lives%22&quot;&gt;WNEW-FM&lt;/a&gt;. When they started playing one of their biggest hits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations&quot;&gt;Good Vibrations&lt;/a&gt;, the audience erupted in ecstasy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys&quot;&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; now looking a lot different, but playing the same wonderful California music from the 60s. They couldn't be more different from the Dead, but there they were up on stage together. They were back, this time for good. This is a recording of the whole concert, the link &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kRKY-S4wI1s?si=zTwSE5tvk6LKNjjb&amp;t=2348&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; to the beginning of Good Vibrations. You can hear the gasp of recognition, and the bands recognition of the recognition, and from their it was a party in a party, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRKY-S4wI1s&amp;t=2508s&quot;&gt;sing-along part&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;gotta keep those a lovin' good vibrations happening with you.&quot; We were all growing up very quickly, but we had a moment when we could return to a more innocent time. Lovely the way music pulls you back in time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson&quot;&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt; wasn't there that night but his music certainly was.</description>

			<title>Democrats and men</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted a link to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml&quot;&gt;political disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; from 2018. Also listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-show-trumps-plot-against-the-2026-elections/683107/&quot;&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; with Senator Gallego of Arizona who says, correctly, that the Democrats have work to do with men. It's true, speaking as a man who has been voting solid Democratic since Kerry, but I didn't stop being a man, which is something that makes me cringe to say it, the way I cringed at admitting to being Jewish when I was a kid. I lived in a place where hate of Jews was always just under the surface in school, but not so well hidden at the playground. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Men as a gender were really pushed into a corner we couldn't get out of during #metoo, all men, not just some. If they say they weren't they're lying. I went to a future of journalism conference in 2018, and the only thing men talked about, quietly, among ourselves, was how scared we were of losing everything. It really was bad, but since then it's eased. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about #metoo in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml#1520013967000&quot;&gt;political disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, but didn't promote it for fear of retribution. I was threatened when I stood up for a friend whose life was ruined for as far as I could tell doing nothing wrong. If you don't shut up we'll do you too, basically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Women are people just like men, and when they got to rage online against men, even people I thought I knew and were friends behaved abhorently. The way we imagine Trump might deal with us soon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to add not all women, there were some who didn't forget that their male friends were still friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was very clear where the Democratic Party came down on all this, and of course, the Republicans took total advantage of this. If you want to understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere&quot;&gt;manosphere&lt;/a&gt; as you all call it, start here. I vote with you all, but absolutely abhor the way you pushed us all into a corner and shut down our pride. Women are people too and they can be just as ugly as men. If you believe otherwise you're believing lies. I speak from experience, I was raised to believe all women are saints. That lie did not prepare us well for life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good news is if the Democrats can make peace with men, there are a lot more votes available to us. We can put it behind us, but we can't ignore that in the late teens we went absolutely fucking batshit crazy about half of the electorate. It's amazing the whole thing didn't completely crumble, irrevocably. We can still fix it, but we have to acknowledge that men were hurt in that period. You all seem to have forgotten that we are just people too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Re-reading the #metoo section of the disclaimer I can't believe how I tiptoed around the truth. The truth I didn't dare say was it was a huge hate campaign as divisive as anything the Repubs ever did. In a country that was supposed to outlaw this, and from a political party that was supposed to be liberal. The &quot;both sides do it&quot; reality probably hasn't yet sunk in but the Democrats sided with sadists and fascists. No other way to put it. Men absolutely were silenced. Afraid to speak for fear of retribution. If you were on the wrong side of this you have some soul-searching to do. And you probably pushed a lot of people of all genders into voting for Trump. The Dems posture of &quot;who me?&quot; has an answer -- yes you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The Dems posture of &quot;who me?&quot; has an answer -- yes you." created="Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:23:28 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/06/12/140245.html#a142328"/>

			<description>Using soldiers as a political prop. Trump gave a political speech, lying about protests in front of a group of people dressed as American soldiers. They all appeared to be enjoying the president’s tough talk about the role he wants the military to play in policing the cities. MSNBC should not broadcast this.</description>

			<description>Would one of the browser vendors work with me on doing something nice with displaying feeds in XML form? I don't support obfuscating what a feed is, that just adds confusion.

			<title>Generalissimo Trump?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if Saturday's military parade in Washington was going to be the rollout of the Trump junta, and if that meant the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalissimo&quot;&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; would appear in military garb, perhaps subdued so next year's parade they can add more features. So I asked ChatGPT to help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;President Trump is reviewing the military parade in on a stage in front of the White House in Washington DC. To honor the troops, he’s dressed in a faux military uniform with medals, and a cap that says Make America Great Again. Fighter jets are flying overhead.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I tried the first time, last night, it got halfway through the drawing then quit, saying it violated their content guidelines. So I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meta.ai/&quot;&gt;meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;, which also does drawing, and it was willing to do it, and even animated it. I uploaded the result to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308&quot;&gt;AI group&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. It should be visible to everyone, without an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I then tried again with ChatGPT and it was willing to do the same task it wasn't willing to do last night. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/11/generalissimoTrump.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Generalissimo Trump, imagined.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/10/153445.html&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a new feed for great art, 24 times a day. Every hour on the hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today, a version of that feed provides one work of art each day, at midnight, Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://art.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;art.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artdaily.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;artdaily.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I did this feed. I'm crafting a new information product, and I want to include a random work of art but not every hour, once a day is enough. I thought it was worth a detour to make the feed that I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first work of art in the feed on its inaugural issue was &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/artDownloader/main/data/images/FCZ5y6oWQAU8Gum.jpg&quot;&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt; from Hans Holbein the Younger, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/365207&quot;&gt;1526&lt;/a&gt;.

I used their music, since it so totally fit in with the philosophy, ie come as you are, we're all just people. And the song I chose was a good one too, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22US%20Blues%22&quot;&gt;US Blues&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am.

It says we carry forward our art where ever we go, no matter where it takes us, a great work of music or art is always a good thing to share.</description>

			<title>A CNAME for your feed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's something to think about. As you may recall, I have an hourly art feed, available both in RSS and on Bluesky. Same content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I gave each the same new name, &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;art.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you use that URL &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, you go to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of the content stream. And if you give the same URL to a web browser, ie accessing it via HTTP, you get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;RSS version&lt;/a&gt; of the same data. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On Bluesky: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the web: &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;https://art.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse&lt;/a&gt; as a web of feeds. It's open of course, because the web itself is open. And it's pretty social as you will see. It's why I think it's really the first instance of the &quot;open social web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've long felt documents should have their own CNAMEs. I even went so far as to design a system where each node in an outline could have a CNAME. I still believe in this, why not have a hierarchic file system that's as editable as an outline? It's the same idea that works in so many other contexts. It's why the idea of a scripting system on a graphic PC like the early Mac made a world of sense. It's why Unix underneath that same UI was the right way to go. And why the web is so nice, you just View Source and you get to lift the hood and see how it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were smart at Bluesky to use DNS this way. Why invent your own identity system when the net itself has a great distributed system that scales? They just made the wrong call (imho) in not using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; for their timeline data, or at least the outside world's view of their timeline, in both directions -- in and out. That's the basic idea of the Internet itself. No one cares what's behind your TCP interface, it could be a network with a million nodes using some wacky protocol to connect them. As long as I can get to you via TCP, you're on the net. This is the kumbaya philosophy of the net, why not just use what already works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll see that we're able to do some interesting twitter-like stuff with this duality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/321&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for comments and questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/02/23/thinkingOutLoudDnsAsId.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about DNS as ID in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I've long felt documents should have their own CNAMEs. I even went so far as to design a system where each node in an outline could have a CNAME. I still believe in this, why not have a hierarchic file system that's as editable as an outline? It's the same idea that works in so many other contexts. It's why the idea of a scripting system on a graphic PC like the early Mac made a world of sense. It's why Unix underneath that same UI was the right way to go. And why the web is so nice, you just View Source and you get to lift the hood and see how it works." created="Tue, 10 Jun 2025 15:35:59 GMT" image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/06/10/153445.html#a153559"/>
				<source:outline text="They were smart at Bluesky to use DNS this way. Why invent your own identity system when the net itself has a great distributed system that scales? They just made the wrong call (imho) in not using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; for their timeline data, or at least the outside world's view of their timeline, in both directions -- in and out. That's the basic idea of the Internet itself. No one cares what's behind your TCP interface, it could be a network with a million nodes using some wacky protocol to connect them. As long as I can get to you via TCP, you're on the net.

It can collaborate, and it has much more broad and deep knowledge than I do, than any human. No one knows whether it thinks or is self-aware, any more than we know whether humans think or are self-aware. For that reason, I think, ironically, there's no point discussing it, we'll never get an answer, because we have no idea what intelligence or thinking is. But it is every bit as thoughtful as any human I have ever worked with. And the whole business about pattern-recognition is imho bs. People who say that are just repeating what they heard from someone else. From a user standpoint, it's absolutely nothing like pattern recognition.</description>

			<description>Idea for teachers. Allow students to use ChatGPT to write their papers, as long as they submit a log showing how they did it. Maybe they're getting help with writing, but the ideas are theirs? It might be possible to fake that part too, but for now, that's probably a bit too hard.</description>

			<title>The game of being rich</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some random thoughts about wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you're an average middle-class person who works for a tech company when the company is bought out for a huge amount of money and your stock is now worth $10 million. It's liquid today. You just received a check for $10 million. What do you do? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Answer: You buy things to see if there was a reason to make the money, and it turns out there really wasn't. You would have been just as happy in the big house in the rich neighborhood or the smaller house in a more modest area. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then what if you reach another level, now you have a check in your hand for $100 million, then $1 billion, then $25 billion and keep going. It doesn't stop there. At each level you are compelled to find something fantastic that you can use that money for. Some power that the new level of wealth gets you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, they played out the lunacy, the people use a lot of space, but they're still just people. If they loved someone or someone loved them, they'd be much happier than all the happiness all that money ever gave them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Having such large useless amounts of money is a not only a problem for the rich folk, we've found out, it's a problem for everyone else too, because eventually they get around to buying political power and they start using the money to change other people lives, always for the worse, it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need a new game that only super rich people can play that doesn't hurt the rest of us. I'm not advising anyone to do anything. But I think this is what I've been writing about on my blog since the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't understand why, for example, Evan Williams didn't just make technology and give it away, after having made billions from Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Bill Gates have to accumulate so much money and threaten the independence of the open web, a miracle, to get it? Why not use your power to make miracles &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; you retire, start doing the good you were promising to do later, right now? What good, in hindsight, did the extra billions do for anyone, including Gates? When his power was at his peak, in the 90s, he could have done a much bigger thing for the world, give us a free new level of communication that would be available equally to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, having done some incredible things in computers, finance, cars and space, had to invent new challenges that only his wealth can buy, and eventually came up with things that only the US Treasury could buy, and some things like relocating the human species on Mars, that no amount of money can buy (or so scientists say). He needs to receive an award of love and gratitude for not using his wealth to make everyone else totally miserable (including himself, it seems).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I haven't yet read &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22evan%20osnos%22&quot;&gt;Evan Osnos'&lt;/a&gt; new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Haves-Have-Yachts-Dispatches-Ultrarich/dp/1668204487&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about billionaires, but I want to. He's done some great reporting in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: See also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;Transcendental Money&lt;/a&gt;, or money that replenishes itself, ie money that transcends time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: Another one: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;Your human-size life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPS: Ted Turner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quoteswise.com/ted-turner-quotes-2.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I bet you’re all wondering what it feels like to be a billionaire. It’s disappointing really. I’ve learned that great wealth isn’t nearly as good as average sex.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Mathematical proofs creative things, not algorithmic. That has not been my experience with ChatGPT and creating software. I find that when I want to talk about software I'm working on, it understands what I'm saying, but I've never had it come up with an original idea on its own.

			<title>When the web was new</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/06/timBernersLee.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was an active software developer when the web came online in the early 90s. I knew what &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Macintosh&quot;&gt;closed systems&lt;/a&gt; were like, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=unix&quot;&gt;open systems&lt;/a&gt;. The web was open, and a miracle because of its radical simplicity. We were so lucky. We developed all kind of stuff that was only possible when there was no platform vendor. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then in the mid 00s things changed, and since then the users have flocked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=twitter&quot;&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=facebook&quot;&gt;systems&lt;/a&gt;. It would be similarly wonderful if we had an open &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt;, but we don’t. Mastodon is open but it’s not simple like the web is, and Bluesky is simple, but it is not open. And neither supports the most basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;features of the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today most active devs weren’t around when the web came along and knocked down the silos. It is imho possible to have an open social web, but the people who are trying to make one out of complex and closed systems will imho never get there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They would be better off to look for different foundations to build on other than Mastodon and Bluesky. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordpress&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in mind, btw. You will probably be surprised, but then we were all surprised by the web itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fediforum report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was an email I sent to one of the people I'm working with at Automattic, and realized I was actually writing a blog post. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was watching on the FediForum session yesterday, and heard all this stuff about Bluesky and Mastodon, but these are products that are poorly prepared for the &quot;open social web&quot; -- and imho they won't get there. But WordPress is already there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think some of the products are good, btw -- I hadn't seen Surf, it's basically a feed aggregator that can get input from Bluesky and Mastodon. I don't think they're using their RSS support though. Not adequate. But WordPress RSS is fine. I made an improvement to the Scripting News RSS to add an &amp;lt;image&gt; element that works like the one on a WordPress site. Now my posts can show up in the timeline via RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the key to what we're doing. Reading and writing, with the UI of a twitter-like product, all built on RSS, with the content also appearing on the network WordPress has defined. I see this as huge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this needs to be a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Why don't people, esp journalists, call them out on this? We've been around this loop over and over in tech. There's a virtual conference today, FediForum, that on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://fediforum.org/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; repeats &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/05/promises.png&quot;&gt;the hype&lt;/a&gt;. Why do people do this? What's the point of pouring your time into technology you hope someday will be open? I bought a ticket to the conference so if there are any sessions that look like they might be productive I can participate. I even wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/04/162206.html&quot;&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see there is a way for this stuff to start working, quickly, if the vendors you're looking up to are sincere in their promises. I've posted it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114630925085003307&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lqufhhswis2r&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; so if you have comments or questions, we can start the discussion now, or any time.</description>

			<source:outline text="Regular readers of my blog know that I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Bluesky&quot;&gt;calling out Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; and people associated with it for saying they're an open platform, and part of the web, when they are neither. Why don't people, esp journalists, call them out on this? We've been around this loop over and over in tech. There's a virtual conference today, FediForum, that on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://fediforum.org/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; repeats &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/05/promises.png&quot;&gt;the hype&lt;/a&gt;. Why do people do this? What's the point of pouring your time into technology you hope someday will be open? I bought a ticket to the conference so if there are any sessions that look like they might be productive I can participate. I even wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/04/162206.html&quot;&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see there is a way for this stuff to start working, quickly, if the vendors you're looking up to are sincere in their promises.

			<description>Now a personal comment. What pisses me off most about Bluesky is the political environment all this is happening in. We &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; an open social web. They've got a lot of people convinced they are it. They are not and they know it. And they keep leading people on. They should either deliver, now, or get out of the way.</description>

This required me to go through some very old code that my system still depends on. It's remarkable how much time this seemingly small feature took to implement. One of these days I have to move this code to one of my more modern servers. One reason it took so long is that a random package that does something that never changes, had a breaking change in it. The breakage culture of the Node.js world is just plain fucked up, no other word for it.</description>

			<description>I've heard that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Andor&lt;/a&gt; is great stuff. I'm on episode 6 of season 1, and it's the usual Star Wars bullshit. It was fun in 1978. But now? It's so freaking boring. Tell me it's worth continuing to watch, that it gets an actual plot at some point.</description>

			<title>Can David Frum hear me?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been enjoying the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/the-david-frum-show/&quot;&gt;David Frum podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He's very good at thinking and does a lot of it, and expresses himself very well. I read all his columns and have read two of his books, even though I don't share much of his pre-Trump politics, I find it interesting to hear how he parses things. I also subscribe to The Atlantic. I listen to him. But in this week's episode it's clear that the listening is one-way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-showwhy-are-the-media-so-afraid-of-trump/683029/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; we heard from the elite journalist David Frum, interviewing elite editor in chief Marty Barrett, formerly of the Washington Post, and they both make what I believe are wildly inaccurate generalizations about the quality of the news reporting by professionals and the ugliness and inadequacy of bloggers and podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, they don't read widely enough to know that there are bloggers and podcasters with good intentions, ethics, deep knowledge and experience who are also well educated -- they don't know we exist and therefore can't hear about the huge mistakes they are making with their own self-perception of their role that we can see because we are not in their world. (BTW, I have been in their world, I was a contributing editor at Wired, a research fellow at Harvard and NYU, each for two years, and I have collided with Frum-like elites, the usual response is a hand-wave of dismissal, written off as not worth listening to, I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Frum, at the end of the episode talks about how the press covered Biden's incapacity, that led to the second Trump term. They should have stopped, once we were all informed of what happened, and let the &lt;i&gt;electorate&lt;/i&gt; decide, it wasn't up to them, or the celebrities they gave space to in their op-eds. In the United States, the &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; decide. Instead they put up a roadblock and wouldn't let the issue drop. We all knew, we were all informed, probably long before we read a single article about his debate performance. They should have stopped. That was their malpractice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their responsibility was to give us the information, and it was also their responsibility to stop right there. Once informed, they were wrong in continuing to harp on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We saw them do it with Governor Cuomo of New York. And Senator Al Franken. And Donald McNeil at the NY Times. And on and on. There's so much reporting that's lazy and incompetent, but they'll never report on that, because of their conflicts. And they never listen to their critics. And as a result they play a role they are not entitled to play.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They need to wake up to the idea that while reporting from their bubble is still important and is heard, they misuse it regularly, and we are fed up with it. If they want to control the government, do the right thing, and run for office. Don't do it from your byline in the Washington Post or NY Times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My keynote for FediForum</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fediforum.org/&quot;&gt;FediForum&lt;/a&gt; is a virtual conference that starts on June 5. If they had asked me to keynote, this is roughly what I would say.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho this stuff is pretty freaking simple, esp since there are well over 20 years of prior art to use, and not that many ways to do what we're trying to do. I'm impatient, so here's a quick set of observations with my opinion, take it for what it's worth, ymmv, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You shouldn't be reinventing so much. Always look around for &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. That will make it possible for you to interop more quickly at both a software level and at a human level. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't invent stuff you think you may need later. Save that for later. You have no intuition for what's needed and more important nothing to test against. You will get it wrong 100 percent of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't invent stuff you think you may need later that makes what you're doing now more complicated. I see a lot of that in ActivityPub.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only reason you're doing all this work is for interop. If you've been doing it for years and you don't have much meaningful interop you're doing it wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Write the software first. Use formats that exist, or if you must invent new stuff, make sure it's simple. Work on its simplicity as you would any other feature. Factor! If there are going to be 100 interoperable products and you make it a little more difficult to implement, that work will be multiplied 100 times. And it be a barrier to entry, so you may not get the most powerful interop possible with the most interesting products. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Read and follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. There aren't that many. But if you're breaking them, you're not going to end up with a standard. If your goal is to appear to be making standards, you should also read RFSM, and don't do anything in it. I've seen people do that btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Have you looked at the world outside the tech stuff to see how important this all has become? All the time we're wasting is very costly in everything that depends on the social web actually existing as opposed to just being talked about.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, what would I request if I could influence you??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon and Bluesky should support inbound and outbound RSS, and do it really well. Right now they do outbound only, and the implementations are incomplete at covering the functionality they have now, and there needs to be more (see the next item). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They'd support the basic features of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec, including Markdown because it's a great standard, very much of the same school as RSS. If it had existed when we did RSS 2.0 it would have been part of it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. Really not much work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From there we'd have 25 years of interop to explore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we could really call this the open social web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm ready to do it any time you all are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yours in not wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/04/talkVisualized.png&quot;&gt;visualize&lt;/a&gt; me giving this talk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Comments or questions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114630925085003307&quot;&gt;Masto&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lqufhhswis2r&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Imho this stuff is pretty freaking simple, esp since there are well over 20 years of prior art to use, and not that many ways to do what we're trying to do.

					<source:outline text="Write the software first. Use formats that exist, or if you must invent new stuff, make sure it's simple. Work on its simplicity as you would any other feature. Factor! If there are going to be 100 interoperable products and you make it a little more difficult to implement, that work will be multiplied 100 times.

I don't think it's good or bad, it could work out great. No one knows if this was The Season the Knicks were meant to go to the Finals, but if it was, maybe next year will be too? There's no right answer. Maybe this was Dolan's call. I hope not.</description>
