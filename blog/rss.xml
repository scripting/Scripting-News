It's not clear what intelligence in humans is or how it works. We just believe it exists. So then the question is, can machines do the same thing? The truth is no one knows. It could be that human intelligence, once we figure out what it is, will be as trivial as they tell us the AI &quot;intelligence&quot; is. So if you're trying to make sense of it, or if the idea is offensive, try pretending that &quot;intelligence&quot; was &quot;pomegranate&quot; or &quot;cauliflower&quot; -- these are two terms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKoFCUaUbY&quot;&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; suggested George Harrison use in place of words in &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/The-beatles-something-lyrics&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; he hasn't come up with. Say ChatGPT is &quot;Artificial Cauliflower&quot; and that should be less offensive, yes? It would make as much sense as calling it intelligence. On the other hand, conversation with my favorite Artificial Cauliflower app does feel pretty much exactly like conversing with a human. A very patient and very knowledgeable and intelligent (whatever that means) but not infallible human.</description>

			<title>How about those Mets!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/04/caseyStengelMetsManager.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;We are a Mets family. Around the kitchen table in my childhood home, the default question was &quot;What did the Mets do?&quot; Before I was born we were a Brooklyn Dodgers family, always National League, but the Dodgers left shortly after I was born and the Mets came along when I was seven, and that was it for us. It was the one thing we all agreed on -- the Mets. Much later when my Mom and I would fight about something, a pretty regular thing -- I invented what I called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hello.typepad.com/hello/2009/11/shea-stadium-rules.html&quot;&gt;Shea Stadium Rules&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that a disagreement could be tabled when we remember that underneath everything we are true Mets fans, and ultimately Mets fans can find something to agree on -- that rain or shine and there was plenty of rain, we always stood with our team. A deeper truth of the Mets was we didn't really mind when they lost. Because underneath it all at a whole other level, the Mets have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that is strong. We are the Mets and that's all you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last night it wasn't lookin good. It was a winner-take-all game with the hated (for now) Milwaukee Brewers. We hated them because it looked like they were going to end the Mets season in the first round of the playoffs. I was getting ready to take off my Mets cap for the year, and put on my Knicks cap, when Lindor walked, then Nimmo singled, and with runners on first and third and one out, Pete Alonso comes to the plate. He's been cold all year. I hoped for a base hit or at least a long sacrifice fly to bring in the runner on third. I couldn't watch but forced myself to. And then &lt;b&gt;it happened&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We who have been joined at the heart to this team and have been through it all, have come to expect failure, but sometimes winning happens, as it did last night. A big swing. The bat connects. Oh please let it land anywhere but the glove of a Brewer, and then all of a sudden Alonso is jogging around the bases, and delirium takes over, in the living room of my mountain home and everywhere Mets fans were at that fateful hour. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We figured at that point they might as well just retire the side, but the Metsies, who Casey Stengel, the first manager asked &quot;Can't anyone play this stinkin game!&quot; -- brought in another run, which it turns out we didn't need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Brewers were overwhelmed. They tried to score in the bottom of the ninth but the Mets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; was too strong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like every baseball kid's fantasy -- the count is 3 and 2 ,the team's back is to the wall, up comes the slugger, the crowd is silent and then he hits it &lt;b&gt;out of the park&lt;/b&gt; and the team emerges victorious and the young person's fantasy saves the day. We've all been there, many times. Last night we got to live it, again, this time for real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now we go to Philadelphia to give them a proper dose of New York love. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Mets meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Game 1 of the NLDS begins tomorrow at 4PM. Good times will be had by all (except Philadelphia fans of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This wasn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/08/baseballCanTeachUsAboutLif.html#p9&quot;&gt;Mookie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/whole-new-ballgame/new-york-mets-1986-world-series&quot;&gt;game 6 &lt;/a&gt;of the 1986 World Series, but it was along those lines of improbability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I love that they give a realtime readout on screen of the probability of each team winning. At the top of the ninth, before all the michegas, the Mets had only a 6% chance of winning. I think every game should come with a graph over time of this stat. It would be an emotional map, much more interesting than the other stats.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And you could tell it whether or not you want lies, or if they should omit the lies. Personally I would opt out of the lies, but some people like lies in their news, kind of like menthol in cigarettes. And forget about paying the news orgs.

			<title>AI deflates the value of expertise</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I didn't read the WSJ story about the deflation of expertise, quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla&quot;&gt;Vinod Khosla&lt;/a&gt;, Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who I know from my time in California. He says AI leads to a deflation of expertise. I agree with him, AI absolutely deflates the value of expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It aggregates all of our knowledge in one place where it's easy to access, about anything you want to know. It answers questions that you can't get any other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think about it. That's not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that didn't have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without television, and I didn't use a computer until I was 18 or use the web until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has been stretched before and I'm well educated and in my work have explored frontiers of knowledge, even so -- this is the most mind-stretching experience I've ever had. Not kidding. And I'm not a VC or prone to overhyping tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well." created="Thu, 03 Oct 2024 15:35:02 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/03/152757.html#a153502"/>

			<title>What is a writing portal?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So far we've only created reading portals. What I want for myself and for you, is a writing portal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A reading portal brings a lot of writers together so you can read them all in one place.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A writing portal is the same idea but in reverse. I write in my portal, and it flows where ever I want it to.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem is the reading portals aren't open to allow this to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all want you to write in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trade Secrets Radio: &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting&quot;&gt;What is podcasting?&lt;/a&gt; This is the exact moment, 9/24/2004, that podcasting got its name and its definition. It's pretty short. We knew what we were doing. We loved what RSS did for news. Now we were doing the same for radio. Not just talking about it, but finally -- doing it. It worked, pretty freaking well. There's a podcast episode to go with it, coming out shortly.</description>

If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.</description>

			<description>I had a dream last night with many of my dead relatives present. We were at some kind of social event. My grandfather had a new wife or girlfriend, but he didn't recognize me, though he pretended to. My mother was far off in the distance taking pictures. I wonder what that means. Some of them &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; dead and gone. I had to remind myself of that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.) My subconscious has a clear idea of who they are/were, only it doesn't register that some of them are gone.</description>
