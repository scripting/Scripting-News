We have to rebuild the open web as much as we need to rebuild local journalism. It's very much the same kind of thing. All our news flows will soon be going through ten servers. This is by design. It works a lot better for Google if they only have to keep their eye on Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon and a few others.</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_(film)&quot;&gt;Barbie&lt;/a&gt; and it was so bad. Made my stomach ache. The movie is an ad for products you can buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbie/Barbie/page/0716B6AC-A900-48E2-975E-E13245703AAF&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The ultimate of exploitation. It got an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/barbie/&quot;&gt;80 on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;. What is wrong with everyone! It was probably the worst movie ever made.</description>

			<title>You can't be meek</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a difference in tech you have to do things normal people would think are too radical. It might be the biggest hurdle to get over. You think shit, it's probably not going to work either way, so I'll just do it that way that &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note I said &quot;make a difference&quot; not &quot;succeed&quot; because then we have to discuss what success means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 68 I'm still getting ideas that require throwing caution to the wind. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Time travel theory</title>

Of course maybe we have been, but for some reason they're not visible to us, they're in another dimension or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But assuming we could experience their presence if they were here, maybe it's because in order for a time traveler to land here, we need to have a certain technology that we don't yet have, that acts as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_receiver&quot;&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the day when that receiver is invented, perhaps unknowingly to the inventor, all of a sudden their house or apartment turns into a religious and historic shrine, a Disneyland or Fort Sumter of time travel. The place is instantly transformed into Wailing Wall, Ground Zero, or Mount Rushmore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine there is already a science fiction book based on this premise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've created a lot of Gmail accounts over the years, but I don't remember what most of them are! I thought I could &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/23/bardtalk.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;ask Bard&lt;/a&gt;, with its new interface to Gmail to give me the list, but either I don't know how to ask the question, or it's not ready with that kind of data? No matter what, we're in very early days for this. Also I think Google should spin off its AI stuff, they're too much of a monopoly to monopolize this. Yes, I can hold all these ideas in my head at the same time, you can too. :-)</description>

			<title>Second wind considered harmful</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/22/empireStateBuilding.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I thought I had caught a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_wind&quot;&gt;second wind&lt;/a&gt; at 6PM last night, and rather than watch political nonsense on MSNBC (every day the same freaking &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt; story about the ancient fascist with orange hair) I went upstairs, rolled up my sleeves and wrote some new code deep in the bowels of the system I'm working on to report on SQL queries that were taking too long or returning too much data. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was feeling very competent. Unfortunately the feeling was an illusion, the kind of mistake a novice makes. After a long day of wrestling with a codebase, you're in need of relaxing MSNBC&lt;i&gt;isms&lt;/i&gt; -- not another tech challenge; and I am most definitely not a novice at making messes of a working piece of software. I've been doing it for 50 years! Half a century of software mayhem. It's even worse than it appears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it appeared to work for the first few calls as I stepped through the code in the debugger, and then confident (still) I let it rip, and a horrific error message appeared about something called &lt;code&gt;flQueueAllRequests&lt;/code&gt; which presumably I put there a few years ago, and I panicked: &quot;Revert! Time to revert Davey!&quot; I said to myself, possibly in my mind or possibly out loud even. But alas &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; will not let you revert. The version numbers must move forward, never backward. How little the designers of NPM really understood about software development. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once a very long time ago, in 1976, I thought that they shouldn't put programmers in offices on the 39th floor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building&quot;&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt; with windows that open. I had a similar desperate empty feeling last night at 8PM. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried to revert as best as I could, but the horrific crash persisted, and I did something I never do, I got up from the computer with the software I'm working on broken. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I woke up in the middle of the night and thought &quot;Davey you're not going to sleep any more, so get up and find the freaking problem.&quot; So I did. I got up. But I did not find the freaking problem. I wrote a sad missive to the people I'm working with asking for sympathy and help. And when I finally woke up for real at 7:30AM, with the sun out, birds singing, feeling rested and ready for a new challenge, I sat down, before eating breakfast or drinking coffee, rolled up my sleeves and set about fixing the problem. My first three attempts didn't work, then I finally thought of something I might do that did in fact fix the problem, and now I can breathe again. &lt;i&gt;Whew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this novice move and its consequences I'd like to ask the NPM folks to come up with a way to say &quot;get me the latest version of this package&quot; instead of devising complex ways of saying whatever it was I was telling it to do that it did that made my software behave so badly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yes, it's always fun to blame someone else, esp someone whose name you don't know, for your own mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your faithful reporter, Uncle Davey&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Seriously, once I understood what the problem was I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/6fcc5702-75e5-4581-960c-040cc5c01549&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; for the answer, and it's surprisingly complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The title of this post is a twist on title of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;famous CS paper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I imagine the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; would have considered other constructs harmful such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp&quot;&gt;await&lt;/a&gt;, and all the other extra junk they're throwing at JavaScript these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Let's mark this line clearly. Talk like that is full of alarm for Jewish people, esp those raised by people who survived the last holocaust. If this doesn't stop you in your tracks, then you probably won't notice when they start calling us vermin, restricting our movement, take our property, move us to ghettos and then systematically incinerate us the way you would rid yourself of an infestation. You know the old story about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog&quot;&gt;frog boiling in water&lt;/a&gt;. We all are on that path. This was always where Make America Great Again was going, an America with all the Jews dead.

			<source:outline text="Yesterday the &quot;former president&quot; as he's referred to on TV, or &lt;i&gt;Mr President&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcsn_6Wln60&quot;&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, shared a post that said &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4209650-trump-shares-post-bashing-liberal-jews-who-voted-to-destroy-america/&quot;&gt;Jewish liberals&lt;/a&gt; are destroying America. Let's mark this line clearly. Talk like that is full of alarm for Jewish people, esp those raised by people who survived the last holocaust. If this doesn't stop you in your tracks, then you probably won't notice when they start calling us vermin, restricting our movement, take our property, move us to ghettos and then systematically incinerate us the way you would rid yourself of an infestation. You know the old story about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog&quot;&gt;frog boiling in water&lt;/a&gt;. We all are on that path. This was always where Make America Great Again was going, an America with all the Jews dead. That this isn't Story One on every front page and newscast says everything you need to know about how journalism is failing us." created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 13:44:07 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/02/27/boozerAndLittleDave.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/09/19.html#a134407"/>

			<description>If anyone from MacArthur or Knight is tuned in, here's an idea. Help us get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ez-pass+for+news+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass for News&lt;/a&gt; going. It's a bootstrap. If there were incentives. If it were seen as a good cause. It could increase the fluidity of news around the country and world by an order of magnitude. That can't help but increase cash flow through news orgs. But more importantly it give us more access to ideas that don't come from the NYT et al. Might be a nice way to boost all the local news orgs being supported by the $500 million fund.</description>

			<title>Textcasting revisited</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; applies the philosophy of podcasting to text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also describes what we should have done when Twitter first came along, what I would have done if I were them. We would have had a much different situation now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Textcasting also says that all the tribulations of Activitypub aren't necessary. No one has bothered to think this through at the top level, everyone is working in niches, not really aware of what anyone else is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism also refused to look. So they were guided into a gulag by Twitter and now they don't like it. If anyone had thought through where they were going, that would have led to &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; too. They should have owned the new news environment, instead they and we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/trolls/#1515276557000&quot;&gt;controlled&lt;/a&gt; by it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that keeps me focused is writers. It's all about writers, what tools they need to think and collaborate, without boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a shame because if something you wrote is getting a lot of hits you can't tell where they're coming from. I'm sure there's a privacy reason for this. Perhaps if you were clicking a link from a porn site to a tech blog, you might not want the site to know where you came from, esp if the destination site is Facebook? Not sure. I've been noticing this for a long time, but only yesterday took the time to rule out a bug in my code.</description>

			<description>Yet another time Google pulled the rug out from under bloggers, acting as the defacto owner of the web. To big tech companies we just don't exist, probably because to news orgs we don't exist either. Not being able to tell where your stuff is being discussed means you can't learn or persuade. Maybe we should have a human network that manages to get links back to the blogger?</description>

			<description>It's that time of year when I get into MLB, and unfortunately the Mets aren't in the race this year. Probably won't root for anyone, but I really like watching the game this time of year. For now I'm watching the Mets, it's relaxing with absolutely nothing at stake. Except I can't believe they're thinking about not signing Pete Alonso. A homegrown star. The rarest thing these days in NY baseball.</description>

It's provably faster, and it makes it possible to build bigger machines that do more. The challenge of software development is to factor and factor so you can add another story to the skyscraper that your product has become. Eventually you have to stop building, one mind can't comprehend that much. Better tools makes it possible to build and manage more complex machines. I have no idea what's around the corner in software development when we can rely on cyber-minds to keep track of complexity for us. We'll have to develop new modes of communication between the human and computer brains, and I seriously doubt if it'll involve implants, more likely it'll happen first when we invent new language. And each of us should be able to create our own. At some point we'll realize we aren't even making sounds. It'll have sensors that learn how our bodies change when we have certain ideas. Who knows. But what possibilities!</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/18/radioUserLand.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I saw a thread somewhere about why &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; was used as the export format for feed readers. Not sure I've ever written about this. At the time we were finishing up &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, in either 2001 or 2002 (there were two big releases). I wanted a way to export the user's feed list so people could use the same list in another reader. This one decision is why there are so many feed readers imho. Because we offered no lock-in as a key feature, everyone else including Google had to do it with their products. Users had the expectation of data portability, so it's in the DNA of feed readers. Maybe we would have dominated the market with Radio if we didn't export the feed list, it was for a while the only feed reader, but more likely Google would have entered and clobbered us, users wouldn't have been able to use both products, or easily move on after Reader shut down. Anyway, why OPML? First, we had it around, it was new, I wanted people to use it, and I also wanted to use the outliner to edit my subscription lists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; didn't exist as an option at the time. And using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; for that seemed confusing and not right. RSS is a syndication format, representing a &lt;i&gt;flow&lt;/i&gt; of information, where OPML represents a list that evolves, but each item has permanence. It's static where RSS is dynamic. It's like the difference between a podcast and an album of music. You listen to a podcast once and it's gone,  you may listen to an album many times over decades. Fundamentally different kinds of data, with different needs in how they evolve, and thus the format you use to represent it. Yes we could have shoehorned feed lists into RSS, but 20 years later I'm glad we didn't.</description>

			<description>I asked ChatGPT how I used OPML to share lists of feeds. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/6e0ad9be-d6dd-4255-bab2-2082e4203e22&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; it came back with is amazing. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/c/f421cbd6-bbc0-4c52-81fa-f940b2e09227&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for the list in OPML.

			<description>Noted that WordPress blogs &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;can now peer&lt;/a&gt; with Mastodon and other ActivityPub nodes. Suppose I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress site&lt;/a&gt; and my username is scripting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/272&quot;&gt;What address&lt;/a&gt; would you follow in Mastodon?</description>

			<description>I have a few virtual servers at Digital Ocean, and two of them are running &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;, so the sites hosted on these machines are HTTPS not HTTP. Caddy is the best. You install it, configure it and that's it. It takes care of all the michegas with the EFF, makes them completely invisible. Also makes it possible to switch thank goodness, I didn't miss that the EFF built themselves into the new system, not by force exactly, but by default. Heh. They get a lot of free marketing. Anyway, the fact that Caddy exists means that Amazon S3 could offer HTTPS access to everything I store there without me having to do anything but check a box in a dialog somewhere. So why don't they do it, make HTTPS zero cost to implement and maintain. They could even charge extra. It's kind of perfect, they know who I am better than anyone. We could make HTTPS disappear, which imho would be a good thing.</description>

He was always interested in new ideas, new ways to approach problems.  But you never get a new idea when you're freaking about how you need a new idea now.</description>
