			<description>It would be interesting if &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt; had an API. I would love to be able to one-click subscribe to a podcast in my feed reader. I mention Pocket Casts because it's the podcast client I use on my phone, but I would obviously like to see them all support an API, ideally a common API.</description>

I had just listened to a New Yorker podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/wireds-katie-drummond-on-what-the-tech-titans-learned-from-doge&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief&quot;&gt;EIC&lt;/a&gt; at Wired, saying the hype was bullshit. You hear this from journalists a lot. The only way you can conclude this, imho, is if you aren't using the stuff. It's as if you were a journalist in the 60s and said the story of the Beatles is that their hair must be fake. OK, whatever you say, but have you listened to the freaking music?? I'm sure a lot of journalists in the 60s said bullshit like that but the Beatles did turn the world upside down, and it stayed that way. It marked the beginning of something very new. And, as with AI, &lt;i&gt;journalism missed the story&lt;/i&gt;. If you don't trust the CEOs, that's okay, probably the right approach. But that doesn't mean they're wrong about the value of the tech. Develop sources the old fashioned way, and if you think money biases the CEOs in favor of the hype, listen to experts who don't have any stock in the companies.</description>

			<description>Another benefit of ChatGPT. It forces you to think and express yourself in tight logical language. Garbage in garbage out. All of a sudden rigorous thinking is required to get a result. This is very different from social media, where garbage is rewarded.</description>

			<description>This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://links.daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;rendering of my linkblog&lt;/a&gt; in WordPress. This is a major milestone. We have in WordPress, what you see on the Links page on scripting.com, implemented entirely in WordPress. Scott Hanson is in charge of the Baseline theme, the one that we're using to build out the WordPress side of WordLand's features. Here are his &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/07/30/linkblog-homepage-layout/&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; on the linkblog feature.</description>

			<description>Now here's the real reason I need &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; and if you write for WordPress sites, I think you'll want it too. It's because WordPress is like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word&quot;&gt;Microsoft Word&lt;/a&gt; of web writing. If you ask someone how they do their site, in 2025, it's probably going to be WordPress. So if someone invites you to write a guest post on their blog, chances are pretty good I can write it in WordLand, and it'll be archived in my collection of writing, and easy for me to find, because that's what WordLand does for writers. So I was able to create the new post on the WordCamp site in less than a minute, and it was completely painless. And that's the point. Here's the screen shot:</description>

			<description>But what about Substack and Ghost? A lot of people do their writing there too? What about those people. Here's the cool part for all people who write on the web. The API we use in WordLand to hook up to WordPress is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js&quot;&gt;open and documented&lt;/a&gt;. They don't break their APIs in WordPressLand. At least so far. You could say that API is a standard. And I bet it would be a lot easier for Ghost, for example, to support a limited subset of that API than it has been to get ActivityPub support implemented. Because the WordPress API is what I would call &quot;really simple,&quot; and that's the thing I value most about a good API.</description>

			<title>Apologize to customers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/kevinkelly.bsky.social/post/3lv4vlgcpkp22&quot;&gt;Kevin Kelly writes&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When a customer of yours complains, always apologize first and ask, 'What can we do to resolve this?' even if it is not your fault. Acting as if the customer is right is a small tax to pay to grow a business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amen. Google sent an email saying my Google Fi account was going to be cancelled if i didn't do something, so I clicked the link, everything looked fine. They sent more emails like this, again everything seemed in order. I contacted them via support (hard to find) and they said everything looked fine. They also said I should be sure there was enough credit in the account. I wrote back saying that was insulting, I've been a customer for a long time, and have never missed a payment, and they should apologize for the threats and wasted time. I got back a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleFiLotsOfWords.png&quot;&gt;long email&lt;/a&gt; that did everything but apologize. They also threw in a little gaslighting, talking about my emotional state (frustrated, unsettled). Companies aren't allowed to have opinions about customers' emotions, esp over email.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleNeedsHelpWithThis.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Google needs to take a basic lesson in how to treat customers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My feeling was more &lt;i&gt;surprise&lt;/i&gt; that Google, a large company with billions of users and millions of customers couldn't get something this simple right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They sent more emails like this, again everything seemed in order. I contacted them via support (hard to find) and they said everything looked fine. They also said I should be sure there was enough credit in the account. I wrote back saying that was insulting, I've been a customer for a long time, and have never missed a payment, and they should apologize for the threats and wasted time. I got back a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleFiLotsOfWords.png&quot;&gt;long email&lt;/a&gt; that did everything but apologize. They also threw in a little gaslighting, talking about my emotional state (frustrated, unsettled).

			<description>Listened to a segment on today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home. Here's my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it when you're feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an act of self-love and give you some of the body &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin&quot;&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; that you felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian Trail. A similar idea in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;Bruce Sterling talk&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.</description>

			<description>Everything in ChatGPT is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; nice. I just asked it about a random plant I got as a gift, and it gave me a beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/28/deltaDawn.png&quot;&gt;one pager&lt;/a&gt; with everything I would have had to spend time searching for all right there, beautifully laid out, and all the fine UI touches you might think of already in. It's studying us and learning, and picking out the good stuff, at least so far. The web was like this too in the beginning, mind-exploding inventions every day. We called them &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html&quot;&gt;mind bombs&lt;/a&gt;. The journalists and social media influencers all just complain, while there is a revolution happening, progress that had slowed to a snail pace, or very often went in reverse, is now coming at breakneck speed. This is as transformative innovation as there has ever been, not that I have much perspective on those that happened before I was invented, but it's as big as the Beatles, the PC, web, mobile.</description>

			<title>A Bingeworthy Sunday</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn't planning on this, but there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/bingeworthySupport/issues/5&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that there was a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, looked into it and was able to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Source of problem: When I added a feature that lets you ask ChatGPT to review the program you're looking at, I broke the ability to add a new program to the database. It took about 15 minutes to track down and verify and another few minutes to fix -- and now that important function works again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As long as I was in there working around, I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; to only report program additions. The other events it was reporting just weren't as interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also added that feed to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/blogrolledBingeworthy.png&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd say it works a lot better now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Modernizing my sound system</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got tired of my old sound system, too many wires, a big receiver whose functions I never used, all designed long before the 4-year-old 65-inch OLED screen on top of it all, so I downscaled to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWLCLZPS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Sony soundbar&lt;/a&gt;, figured that was as simple as you could get, for $300, thinking of it as an experiment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I liked it but then I thought to ask ChatGPT a question I've had for a while. I want a small amp designed for today's music and video, and went through a bunch of options and came up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGCLXH4H?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;WiiM Home amp&lt;/a&gt;. No speakers, unlike the soundbar, but hooks up to the TV via the ARC connector, and I have plenty of old speakers to try out in this configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got it yesterday and the setup experience was pretty great and the feature list is totally 2025. Will have more to say for sure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/25/wiimRearView.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Rear view of the WiiM Home amp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It's from a Silicon Valley &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkplay.com/aboutus&quot;&gt;tech company&lt;/a&gt; btw. Nice to see a company just designing nice products and not trying to take over the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When trying to &quot;work&quot; with ChatGPT, realize that it's mistakes could be much worse than you could possibly imagine. It could be leading you down a blind alley. You must always consider how full of shit it is. It may not just be making things up, but it could not understand something very basic about what you're doing. There's no limit to the ways it can be wrong. And you can waste whole programming sessions chasing a solution where none could possibly every under any circumstances be found. The level of bullshit is sometimes hard to fathom.</description>

Another site has a small set of categories. I write all my WordPress posts in the same editor, and could easily set it up so that all categories were available to me in every site I post to. The question: Is that a good practice in the world of WordPress? I noticed that categories are given global ID's so if I use a category like &quot;movies&quot; it will have the same ID as yours has on your sites. I love this idea of a global namespace for categories, and see it as something that could be adopted by sites written in any other writing environment. Anyway, if you have a moment to comment, I'd appreciate your ideas.

			<description>I think I figured out why the AI companies want to do web browsers. It’s so that they can create an application development platform for people who want to write apps that run inside a new environment where the OS is a LLM. Lots of interesting possibilities. Imagine how the OS API might work. You could restructure a database by explaining in English how you want it restructured. In the freaking code. Could we bury Algol-like languages the same way we buried assembly and machine languages? Do we have the courage to imagine such things?</description>

			<description>The nice thing about a blogroll is that it can become a feed reader, in a very small space. It's been on my blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; for over a year, and I use it a lot, largely because I have to go to that page a lot to see how something I've written looks. Then I see that one of my favorite sites has updated, and I take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/19/blogrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;quick look&lt;/a&gt; to see what's new. The way it works, from a technical standpoint, is that it's hooked into a FeedLand instance where I have created a category called &lt;i&gt;blogroll,&lt;/i&gt; and put all the feeds I want in my blogroll in that category. All I have to do to add a new one is subscribe to it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, and click the blogroll &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/19/cats.png&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/a&gt;. Another developer wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@susam/114805652395205268&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about using their blogroll as a feed reader, and I wanted to put my hand up and say yes -- this is a good idea. People should do this. I like it because it's real innovation in feed reading, something that imho has been lacking in the feed world. Lots more potential here. And you're welcome to use my blogroll as your feed reader. I have put it on its own page but it's at a confusing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;location&lt;/a&gt;. Something to fix, maybe later today if I have some time or tomorrow. :-)</description>

It was a good day if he was able to hold them off for one more day. This actually came out in the trial he lost, the 34 guilty verdicts. He's always skating on the verge of bankruptcy. You gotta wonder if the creditors have been paid back yet. I bet some of them haven't.</description>

			<title>What is the web?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is what the term &quot;the web&quot; means to me.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I defer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; who originally coined the term to mean the data structure that connects the documents displayed by the software he introduced in 1993.  He called it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;, which was eventually shortened to web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web is the structure connecting the documents. The documents were pretty standard stuff, designed to work like printed documents produced by word processing and page layout software. Web pages had one feature that could only be approximated on the printed page, the footnote, which gave you a pointer to the source of a quote, or a place to find more information. But the pointer wasn't machine readable, it might have included the title of a book, it's author and its publication date, or a magazine article, indicated by the title of the magazine and its cover date. Like most inventions the web page was designed as a derivative of what came before.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basic features of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; include: a title, paragraphs, subtitles, styling (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), numbered and bulleted lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A web page might be part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; which includes many pages with a common format that link between themselves in the form of a table of contents, navigation links, and possibly an index.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; were the big innovation of the web. They work like footnotes on a printed page, but in this medium, the links are machine-readable and had an easy user interface. A link would be shown in a special style, initially underlined text, and when you hover the mouse over the link the cursor turns to an arrow, inviting the user to click. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click a link, the software accesses the web address that's encoded invisibly in the text of the page, and it loads that page into the browser, replacing the previous page.  The new page can have links, and the pages it links to have links, and there is the web. It's an invisible thing, but it's very real. The need to link was always there, but until graphic computers and fast standardized and easy networking, it wasn't possible. TBL's genius was that he stumbled across this idea, was intrigued, and made it work. It really was new and it turns out revolutionary. A lot could be built, it turns out, based on this one simple difference between electronic and printed pages. And up till that point in time there had never been an electronic page! I kid you not. I grew up in that world, the web-less world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so in summary, the web is made up of linked pages with a simple, standard, easy to understand user interface. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's even more to the web. If it had been the product of a company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web. There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because there's almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn't have to get permission. &lt;i&gt;They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL did.&lt;/i&gt; That's such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy, well that's a very large undertaking, I'd probably have to reinvent the whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That's how you know you're not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a web page I did in 1994. I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do this. And I used software I already had to create it. There was a little basic technology that I built on but most of what you're looking at was a single person's doing. This was just one year after TBL opened his web to the world. That's the kind of explosive progress that's possible when the planets line up like as did with the web. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so, if your system had all the features, it still isn't the web until the developers and writers and designers actually show up and &lt;i&gt;build&lt;/i&gt; the web of relationships between all the sites. The key word there is between. If the linking happens but it's only within one domain, that is not the web. It could be great, just what people want, it could make the investors rich, but it isn't the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's more. It's not enough to do all the things the web does, and that it attract writers, designers and programmers who actually build a web with your idea and tech, it has to work with the web TBL started in 1990. If you've done some web-like things, great -- but it's not the web unless it works with the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There should be some honor in tech. You wouldn't be able to build any of the stuff we're building in the 2020's if it weren't for the foundation built for you by TBL's invention from the 1990's, and all that it made possible. If you steal the name and make it meaningless, you've taken something away from the story of humanity, how we create layers of innovation, and how the generosity of one generation can inspire similar generosity in generations to come. When you usurp the name, you're taking away from that understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now of course it's cool to disagree. Suggestion -- put up a web page, send me a link, I'll read it and if I want to share it I will. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A link would be shown in a special style, initially underlined text, and when you hover the mouse over the link the cursor turns to an arrow, inviting the user to click." created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:35:09 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/07/18/122303.html#a123509"/>
				<source:outline text="When you click a link, the software accesses the web address that's encoded invisibly in the text of the page, and it loads that page into the browser, replacing the previous page.  The new page can have links, and the pages it links to have links, and there is the web. It's an invisible thing, but it's very real. The need to link was always there, but until graphic computers and fast standardized and easy networking, it wasn't possible. TBL's genius was that he stumbled across this idea, was intrigued, and made it work. It really was new and it turns out revolutionary. A lot could be built, it turns out, based on this one simple difference between electronic and printed pages. And up till that point in time there had never been an electronic page! I kid you not. I grew up in that world, the web-less world." created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:56:05 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/07/18/122303.html#a125605"/>

				<source:outline text="But there's even more to the web. If it had been the product of a company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web. There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because there's almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn't have to get permission. &lt;i&gt;They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL did.&lt;/i&gt; That's such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy, well that's a very large undertaking, I'd probably have to reinvent the whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That's how you know you're not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive." created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:40:36 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/07/18/122303.html#a124036">
					<source:outline text="An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a web page I did in 1994. I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do this. And I used software I already had to create it. There was a little basic technology that I built on but most of what you're looking at was a single person's doing. This was just one year after TBL opened his web to the world. That's the kind of explosive progress that's possible when the planets line up like as did with the web." created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:03:42 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/07/18/122303.html#a130342"/>

				<source:outline text="Even so, if your system had all the features, it still isn't the web until the developers and writers and designers actually show up and &lt;i&gt;build&lt;/i&gt; the web of relationships between all the sites. The key word there is between. If the linking happens but it's only within one domain, that is not the web.

You wouldn't be able to build any of the stuff we're building in the 2020's if it weren't for the foundation built for you by TBL's invention from the 1990's, and all that it made possible. If you steal the name and make it meaningless, you've taken something away from the story of humanity, how we create layers of innovation, and how the generosity of one generation can inspire similar generosity in generations to come.

			<title>Two-way vs one-way links</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TBL's links are one-way. This was actually a major innovation, at the time people understood there was something called hypertext, it had been written about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson&quot;&gt;Ted Nelson's&lt;/a&gt; almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22ted%20nelson%22&quot;&gt;biblical book&lt;/a&gt; of the pre-web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines&quot;&gt;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&lt;/a&gt;. Previous attempts at hypertext assumed links had to be two-way. By limiting the links to one direction, the technical problem became trivial. You could do two-way links today because relational databases are mature and inexpensive to operate, perform very well on today's hardware, and the internet of 2025 is much faster than the internet of 1990. But the one-way limit was necessary for the web to achieve its simplicity, and the non-existence of a platform vendor, which may have been its most important feature. It could still be done, but it would require a lot of cooperation and backfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
