			<title>Why I like my Model Y</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a150415&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I'd trade in my Model Y if an non-Tesla EV came along that equaled it. A few people asked what I liked about the Model Y that I'm not finding in alternatives. Here's the list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I love the handling of the Tesla. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_car&quot;&gt;muscle car&lt;/a&gt; like the 2007 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kbb.com/bmw/5-series/2007/&quot;&gt;BMW 535i&lt;/a&gt; I used to drive, great acceleration, but handles like the 1993 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cars.com/research/mazda-mx_5_miata-1993/&quot;&gt;Miata&lt;/a&gt; another car I owned and loved. I've also owned really sloppy cars like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/forester-2022&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-sienna-2004/&quot;&gt;Toyota Sienna&lt;/a&gt; minivan, even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager#Full-size_van_(AB;_1974%E2%80%931983)&quot;&gt;1974 Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, the largest American passenger car ever made. I'm never going back to a car that doesn't have the authority of a Model Y. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Model Y has lots of headroom, which my long torso needs, so I don't bruise my head each time I get in the freaking car. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a Tesla charger at home, so whatever I buy has to be compatible with or adaptable to it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;4WD is important because where I live it snows in winter, and I drive on dirt roads a lot too.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a computer. It's going to be hard for a competitor to offer the integration with a network that Tesla offers, they're a computer company as much as they're a car company. Their connection to Starlink (assumed to be coming) is going to be hard to compete with too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Calling it &lt;i&gt;self-driving&lt;/i&gt; should get them in trouble with the FTC, there's no way anyone should trust it to drive itself, and the car's OS enforces that view, so I guess they have lawyers at Tesla. That said, I like having access to this technology. I've been an innovative software developer for a long time, and I like using tech that pushes the leading edge. The marketing (a Musk feature presumably) is what I don't like. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Charging network. I occasionally take trips that are out of range of my home charger, to Boston, or NYC sometimes leave me needing a charge on the way home. I'd like to have the option of driving cross-country as well. The Tesla charging network is a big plus. I honestly don't know how good the charging situation is for other brands. This would be something for car magazines to rate, to have a way of measuring it, as people who are put off by Musk's politics (about 1/2 of American voters) look for ways to drive something other than a Tesla. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this turned into an ad for Tesla. Heh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;i&gt;reasons&lt;/i&gt; we love it so much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just separate from Musk and all's well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking Tesla drivers who love America should have some kind of demonstration. We all park our cars around local Tesla dealers, let the police tow our cars, only to be replaced by other Teslas. We're all computer nerds, we could probably even figure out the scheduling. We probably have nearly as much money as they do. Just sayin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tired of companies that push us around politically and Tesla is one of the worst. So far they've managed to convince us they aren't Elon Musk, but that's a mirage, he is the company and the company is him. They are completely one and the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lindell&quot;&gt;My Pillow guy&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCHDCNvC_NE&quot;&gt;pillows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When Bluesky was experiencing its huge post-election surge, it was exciting because lots of users were experiencing the surge in followers and engagement. It was exhilirating. That has slowed to nothing now, no more engagement there than on Threads, Masto or Twitter. The character limit on Bluesky being considerably less than the others makes it harder to rekindle interest imho. And btw the euphoria being gone is neither good or bad, it just is.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is also a tutor. I'm learning new ways of coding SQL through drill and it's also improving my JavaScript code. It's infinitely impatient.

			<description>I'm getting a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22apple+watch%22&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; today, the latest model. My current watch, which I wear all the time (except when it's charging) is a 5th gen. The new one is 10th. I had to upgrade because there's a Tesla watch app out now that won't run on my old watch. It's the most rational add-on for the car. A must-have.</description>

Aggregate all the shows from all the feeds in a list into a single feed. This seems brilliant because it reduces the implementation in the client to almost nothing, just rebuild a feed periodically, it could be done entirely in the client app. But it also could be something users could share with other users, sort of a meta-channel. I think it's brilliant with the caveat that sometimes when you implement it you find something that makes it more complex than it seems at first. This is the second idea I've heard that the initial listening lists idea spawned. I think there's a lot of unexplored possibilities here.</description>

			<title>We need a BDG for Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/pfefferle.org/post/3lcfkqqlcfk2j&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky this morning from a friend, Matthias Pfefferle, who works at Automattic on the connection between WordPress and ActivityPub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A BDG is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide&quot;&gt;Busy Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, something we did &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;for SOAP&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; onto it.  Since then there have been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It's a useful concept because developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that works, and we'll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop, which is the point of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user's writing in a PDS. If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it works there. We can do that because we're using popular simple formats like JSON (see below) to organize our work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you're reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; in a repository on GitHub. Broken down into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07&quot;&gt;months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07/18&quot;&gt;days&lt;/a&gt;, and posts. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each post is a JSON file, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2019/03/03/a025810.json&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. It has three bits of data, the text of the post, when it was created (which also serves as a unique ID, no two posts have the same creation date) and type. This item has a type of outline, because it can have structure, though this post does not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2022/07/06/a232835.json&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; that does have structure. In Bluesky it would be represented as a thread. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the question. What's the absolutely simplest way to have that structure of posts represented in a Bluesky PDS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/674f3d6c-4904-8012-b071-953862cd5b4a&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT to scope this out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Since then there have been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It's a useful concept because developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem before understanding all the theory behind it.

			<description>I'm using the term &quot;RSS-based podcasts&quot; in place of &quot;podcasts&quot; to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other &quot;podcasts,&quot; are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their &quot;podcasts&quot; to RSS and everyone's happy. Like &quot;organic cheeseburgers.&quot; :-)</description>

			<description>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</description>

			<description>Welcome to the last month of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!</description>

			<description>I wasn't clear enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. We're losing the word &quot;podcast&quot; very quickly. It's coming to mean video interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there's no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who will want to impose severe limits. This isn't a casual &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt;, it's &lt;i&gt;urgent.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

And when they want to edit the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasnâ€™t been moving  and if we donâ€™t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get started.</description>

			<title>The Kennedy v Nixon template</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Analogously, Trump is Kennedy and Biden/Harris is Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the social web is, in 2024, what TV was in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump has mastered the new medium. To a large extent, he &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; the new medium, and the resulting network formed around him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-did-trump-win-james-carville-has-discovered-an/id1728152109?i=1000678267539&quot;&gt;Carville says&lt;/a&gt; he wants to figure out how to communicate the way Trump did, he can't because our way doesn't work in his universe. We have to create our own. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogously Nixon might have said about TV in 1959 -- how can we get into that? If you have to ask you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; get there. You have to fit like a hand in a glove, like Kennedy or Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next Democratic candidate to win the presidency will have to be a media creator. They must create a medium that's perfectly adapted to the communication interests of the 50 percent of the electorate that voted for Harris and the other 20 percent who would if they just knew who she was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look at the picture of Kennedy and Nixon. Did we elect Kennedy over Nixon because he had better policy? No. We elected him because he has better hair. Because on TV what counts is your hair. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chris+lydon&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; who was a TV news person told me that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/28/kennedyNixon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kennedy and Nixon on the debate stage in 1960.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to win, create an internet farm system. A network with everyone who wants to run for office nationwide on the Democratic ticket. And let's see how they work in the new medium. We get to know them like we knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/11/26/weElectedArchieBunker.html&quot;&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. And let's get some people we get to know who also tend to tell the truth (though they can screw up and we'll forgive them, remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;gotchas&lt;/a&gt; are over).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The Dems shut down their online operation on Election Day, go off the air for 3.5 years, then reboot. The Repubs never sign off.  Trump is Archie Bunker. People vote for him, even if they don't agree, over the stranger they don't know. Voters kept saying this, but somehow this didn't register. Never nominate a candidate again who isn't well known to and tolerated by the electorate. Forget about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html?title=noMoreGotchas&quot;&gt;gotchas&lt;/a&gt;. The old Dems revolve around fear-of-gotcha. No longer a problem. A flaw proves you're genuine, authentic. Dems need a complete overhaul top to bottom. Their next leader should have a top podcast, because that's how you will govern from now on. Expect to be surprised how Trump does this starting Jan 20.</description>

The Dems shut down their online operation on Election Day, go off the air for 3.5 years, then reboot. The Repubs never sign off.  Trump is Archie Bunker. People vote for him, even if they don't agree, over the stranger they don't know. Voters kept saying this, but somehow this didn't register. Never nominate a candidate again who isn't well known to and tolerated by the electorate. Forget about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html?title=noMoreGotchas&quot;&gt;gotchas&lt;/a&gt;. The old Dems revolve around fear-of-gotcha. No longer a problem. A flaw proves you're genuine, authentic. Dems need a complete overhaul top to bottom. Their next leader should have a top podcast, because that's how you will govern from now on. Expect to be surprised how Trump does this starting Jan 20." created="Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:57:07 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/26/archieAndEdith.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/26.html#a155707"/>

			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;January 2017&lt;/a&gt;, I scooped everyone, by years, on the idea that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;billionaire could buy Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and thus purchase the presidency. That value wasn't priced into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/twtr&quot;&gt;TWTR&lt;/a&gt; stock. No one listened. Here's the next installment. The US government acquires Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The &quot;constitution&quot; reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems, they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been &lt;i&gt;cartelized,&lt;/i&gt; which is one step beyond &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/22/214100.html&quot;&gt;enshitified&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Today there are so many twitter-like systems that are useful, people want to cross-post. If I'm writing something I plan to cross-post, and I pass the 300-char limit, but I'm not finished, what to do. These days generally I view 500 as the actual limit, which means when my cross-poster tries to publish to Bluesky it fails. We should be trying to coalesce on an idea of what a text document is in the mid-late 20s. I've put my &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; out.</description>

			<description>The usual mindless block-inducing bullshit from twitter and every other online venue is showing up on Bluesky. I wonder if people understand the economic box that's pushing them into. It's so important that if it's going to be the next Twitter, we as a world, invest in lifeboats to get off the ship quickly and easily if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan&quot;&gt;Hulk Hogan&lt;/a&gt; ends up being the czar of Bluesky. Weirder things are possible my friends.</description>

We can vote on referendums, support or not support Democratic initiatives. Site would never shut down, and would support campaigns when they're running. It would cost money to belong to the site. This would keep trolling under control, and would fund projects the community would sponsor, and also pay for operating the service. No advertising, no billionaires sponsoring. They can be members like everyone else.</description>

			<description>If such a network existed, we would be nominating our own Cabinet members, the shadow Cabinet. Let the journalists compare the qualifications of our candidates vs the incumbent party's. Create news. That's what the Dems absolutely suck at. They very quietly pass legislation that the other party (which votes against) takes credit for. One party is on the air, the other is not. We need to change that. We make news. And we listen to each other, not just the stuffed shirts who run the party now.</description>
