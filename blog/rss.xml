			<description>When Google says having a certificate isn't enough to operate a website, now you have to be cleared by the US Department of Homeland Security, will you still think it was smart to let Google deprecate HTTP? Or, why do people lose their minds when it comes to Google?</description>

			<title>Nesting in Fargo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Small spoiler for Season 3.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first scene of Season 3 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; has always puzzled me. It takes place in East Berlin during the Cold War. A citizen is brought before a government official where he's asked to confess to a crime that apparently was actually commited by a different person who used to live at the same address. The story then moves to Minnesota, and there's no further mention of the characters or plot of the first scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always wondered why was that scene there, what it has to do with Fargo. Here's my theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every episode of Fargo begins with &quot;This is a true story. The events depicted took place in {location} in {year}. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of the respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's funny because that's what the opening scene is. A supposedly true story (we don't actually know it's true, we suspect not, same as with the show itself) but the names have been changed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything in Fargo is nested that way. That's one of the reasons it's so much fun to re-watch, you see things each time you didn't see before.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It would work. Probably one of the most revolutionary things they could do, and it's so easy. That they all come from DC or New York is probably why most of the rest of the country feels they are so clueless and elite. I laugh when Chris Hayes talks about what he thinks, or what he has experienced. I laugh because I think he's an idiot, and has no relevant experience. How about getting a child of Holocaust survivors to do the news, now that we're on the brink of a Nazi revolution in America. Might help sober people up a bit. Have a segment every night that explains how Hitler did what Trump is doing, and what it led to. This cozy little setup needs to be exploded. Start by getting off the East Coast, and out into the country. It would do wonders for perspective. BTW, President Biden picketing with striking Michigan auto-workers is an excellent example of this approach. He could have given a speech in the Rose Garden but that would have had no impact, wouldn't do anything to shift anyone's perspective.</description>

			<title>Storage and WordPress, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Follow-up on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/09/27/123927.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote yesterday about adding storage to WordPress. Thanks to all the people who helped answer the question, readers of this blog, friends from the Drummer and FeedLand communities, even devs who work at Automattic. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said in the piece: &quot;It has happened before that I’ve asked for a feature in a product that was already there.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; one of those times. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress has the ability to add the equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/8a9f7f36-b1b6-482f-94e7-8aa9b30dc134&quot;&gt;Mac refcons&lt;/a&gt; to WordPress posts. But, and this is an important caveat, you can only create such an object in PHP running on the server that's hosting the website. Once it's created you can access and update the stored object via their API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I haven't tried it myself, because I don't have my own WordPress installation and I assume I can't install software on wordpress.com. And even if I could, it's not the feature I imagined. Tantalizingly close, but not able to do what I want. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A use-case&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to create an editor for WordPress posts that's perfect for me. That means I edit the post in my outliner. I can attach attributes to headlines, like an image attribute with a small graphic that's displayed in the right margin. Or I can enclose text in double-square brackets and have it be indexed by and linked to my tag manager, like this: &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt;. Or I can use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/24/150234.html?title=theGlossaryInLittleOutliner&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; to fill in links and data that I want standardize on. I've developed a set of tools I've been using in some cases for over 30 years. I want to use them in WordPress. But more importantly, I want WordPress to become a writing platform for everyone, I think it can do a lot of important things that it doesn't do, and it's being held back by this missing feature. That's how I look at it, and I realize that's a different perspective from that of developers who work inside Automattic who have to keep their servers running.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, I can do much of that without this feature. But with it, I can edit any post even if I don't have the application I wrote it with handy, or the source code for the post I want to change. This is part of the philosophy of having only one structure for my blog writing, to make it easy to make changes. If I have two structures, one for editing and one for reading all of a sudden making a change takes a dozen or more steps, where if the data lives in the same place as the rendered content, it can be edited with one click. This breakthrough, and it was definitely a breakthrough in the development of blogging, in 1999, was in a post entitled Edit This Page. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I assume the current design makes sure only people who have access to the server can do this. Or maybe it's just an oversight? I hope it's the latter, and I hope we can have the feature in the API in time to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/273&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the Scripting News repo to follow up on this very interesting discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Adding storage to WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am a developer, and WordPress is the largest blogging platform. Naturally, I want to develop products for WordPress. But there's a problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I have an idea for an editor for WordPress posts. I have a constraint, the editor can’t save any information about the post that isn’t in the HTML code for the post. This severely limits the kinds of editors developers can write. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead if WordPress had the idea that an app could store some JSON data along with a post, and when the user wanted to edit the post my editor would get the data back, we could edit all kinds of structures and have the result available in WP, not just to us, but to every app they give permission to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted this feature for WP for a long time. Maybe it’s already there? It has happened before that I’ve asked for a feature in a product that was already there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, this idea goes back to the early Macintosh OS. Every object in the system had a 32-bit refcon which could be anything the app wanted it to be. Usually it was a pointer to an object that contained a lot of data and more pointers. You could attach them to a window, a menu, a button in a dialog, IIRC every object had a refcon. Whole complex systems were built around this idea. It meant that the platform vendor (Apple) could evolve their internal structures without breaking developers. You can develop whole app ecosystems around this simple idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: refcon is short for &quot;reference constant.&quot; The fact that it almost immediately was used for pointers shows how innovative developers can be, and how sometimes an idea has much broader implications than you can foresee. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I couldn't find a page on the web that explains what a refcon is so I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/8a9f7f36-b1b6-482f-94e7-8aa9b30dc134&quot;&gt;ChatGPT to write one&lt;/a&gt;. I can vouch for the accuracy, even beauty, of what it wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: Apparently it is possible to set refcon-like values for WordPress posts. I'll write more about it soon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A story for Mac devs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was writing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/09/27/123927.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about a feature I'd like to see added to WordPress, basically a refcon for each blog post, that would allow me to write an editor that managed data that's structured differently than a classic blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I briefly explained what a refcon was, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=macintosh+refcon&quot;&gt;searched&lt;/a&gt; the web via Google to find a definitive page on what a refcon is. Not finding one immediately, I had the idea of asking ChatGPT to write one. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/8a9f7f36-b1b6-482f-94e7-8aa9b30dc134&quot;&gt;what it came up with&lt;/a&gt; was not only accurate, but imho beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now there probably &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a page somewhere on the web that explains the philosophy of refcons, but once I got the idea to give the problem to ChatGPT that was the end of my searching. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love refcons, they are so respectful, both ways, and I love ChatGPT just as much, because it says even if Google can't find something that doesn't mean I can't have it! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS. I honestly don't know if the Mac OS still has refcons, but it did in the 80s, and they were very important imho to the success of the Mac as a developer platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Lots of great things started there, including political blogging and podcasting. We hosted Thursday meetups, and had two blogging conferences. Trained hundreds of people. That's how you do a bootstrap. Thanks to Automattic for help in preserving a good part of the early history of blogging.

This is what I have learned and what I believe. No matter how enticing you make it the news industry will ignore you or fight you. It's possible a new network of news sites has to be formed, which is far beyond the scope of a startup wanting to explore a technical solution. It's not a technical problem. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. A chicken and egg problem. If there were a network of local news orgs that wanted to band together to kick ass then they would need EZ-Pass for News. But it may not be possible to have EZ-Pass for News unless there is a critical mass of news and users. Bootstraps are delicate things, and startups are almost by definition indelicate things. ;-)</description>

We have to rebuild the open web as much as we need to rebuild local journalism. It's very much the same kind of thing. All our news flows will soon be going through ten servers. This is by design. It works a lot better for Google if they only have to keep their eye on Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon and a few others.</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_(film)&quot;&gt;Barbie&lt;/a&gt; and it was so bad. Made my stomach ache. The movie is an ad for products you can buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbie/Barbie/page/0716B6AC-A900-48E2-975E-E13245703AAF&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The ultimate of exploitation. It got an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/barbie/&quot;&gt;80 on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;. What is wrong with everyone! It was probably the worst movie ever made.</description>

			<title>You can't be meek</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a difference in tech you have to do things normal people would think are too radical. It might be the biggest hurdle to get over. You think shit, it's probably not going to work either way, so I'll just do it that way that &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note I said &quot;make a difference&quot; not &quot;succeed&quot; because then we have to discuss what success means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 68 I'm still getting ideas that require throwing caution to the wind. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Time travel theory</title>

Of course maybe we have been, but for some reason they're not visible to us, they're in another dimension or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But assuming we could experience their presence if they were here, maybe it's because in order for a time traveler to land here, we need to have a certain technology that we don't yet have, that acts as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_receiver&quot;&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the day when that receiver is invented, perhaps unknowingly to the inventor, all of a sudden their house or apartment turns into a religious and historic shrine, a Disneyland or Fort Sumter of time travel. The place is instantly transformed into Wailing Wall, Ground Zero, or Mount Rushmore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine there is already a science fiction book based on this premise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've created a lot of Gmail accounts over the years, but I don't remember what most of them are! I thought I could &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/23/bardtalk.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;ask Bard&lt;/a&gt;, with its new interface to Gmail to give me the list, but either I don't know how to ask the question, or it's not ready with that kind of data? No matter what, we're in very early days for this. Also I think Google should spin off its AI stuff, they're too much of a monopoly to monopolize this. Yes, I can hold all these ideas in my head at the same time, you can too. :-)</description>

			<title>Second wind considered harmful</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/22/empireStateBuilding.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I thought I had caught a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_wind&quot;&gt;second wind&lt;/a&gt; at 6PM last night, and rather than watch political nonsense on MSNBC (every day the same freaking &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt; story about the ancient fascist with orange hair) I went upstairs, rolled up my sleeves and wrote some new code deep in the bowels of the system I'm working on to report on SQL queries that were taking too long or returning too much data. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was feeling very competent. Unfortunately the feeling was an illusion, the kind of mistake a novice makes. After a long day of wrestling with a codebase, you're in need of relaxing MSNBC&lt;i&gt;isms&lt;/i&gt; -- not another tech challenge; and I am most definitely not a novice at making messes of a working piece of software. I've been doing it for 50 years! Half a century of software mayhem. It's even worse than it appears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it appeared to work for the first few calls as I stepped through the code in the debugger, and then confident (still) I let it rip, and a horrific error message appeared about something called &lt;code&gt;flQueueAllRequests&lt;/code&gt; which presumably I put there a few years ago, and I panicked: &quot;Revert! Time to revert Davey!&quot; I said to myself, possibly in my mind or possibly out loud even. But alas &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; will not let you revert. The version numbers must move forward, never backward. How little the designers of NPM really understood about software development. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once a very long time ago, in 1976, I thought that they shouldn't put programmers in offices on the 39th floor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building&quot;&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt; with windows that open. I had a similar desperate empty feeling last night at 8PM. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried to revert as best as I could, but the horrific crash persisted, and I did something I never do, I got up from the computer with the software I'm working on broken. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I woke up in the middle of the night and thought &quot;Davey you're not going to sleep any more, so get up and find the freaking problem.&quot; So I did. I got up. But I did not find the freaking problem. I wrote a sad missive to the people I'm working with asking for sympathy and help. And when I finally woke up for real at 7:30AM, with the sun out, birds singing, feeling rested and ready for a new challenge, I sat down, before eating breakfast or drinking coffee, rolled up my sleeves and set about fixing the problem. My first three attempts didn't work, then I finally thought of something I might do that did in fact fix the problem, and now I can breathe again. &lt;i&gt;Whew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this novice move and its consequences I'd like to ask the NPM folks to come up with a way to say &quot;get me the latest version of this package&quot; instead of devising complex ways of saying whatever it was I was telling it to do that it did that made my software behave so badly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yes, it's always fun to blame someone else, esp someone whose name you don't know, for your own mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your faithful reporter, Uncle Davey&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Seriously, once I understood what the problem was I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/6fcc5702-75e5-4581-960c-040cc5c01549&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; for the answer, and it's surprisingly complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The title of this post is a twist on title of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;famous CS paper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I imagine the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; would have considered other constructs harmful such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp&quot;&gt;await&lt;/a&gt;, and all the other extra junk they're throwing at JavaScript these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If this doesn't stop you in your tracks, then you probably won't notice when they start calling us vermin, restricting our movement, take our property, move us to ghettos and then systematically incinerate us the way you would rid yourself of an infestation. You know the old story about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog&quot;&gt;frog boiling in water&lt;/a&gt;. We all are on that path. This was always where Make America Great Again was going, an America with all the Jews dead.

If this doesn't stop you in your tracks, then you probably won't notice when they start calling us vermin, restricting our movement, take our property, move us to ghettos and then systematically incinerate us the way you would rid yourself of an infestation. You know the old story about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog&quot;&gt;frog boiling in water&lt;/a&gt;. We all are on that path. This was always where Make America Great Again was going, an America with all the Jews dead. That this isn't Story One on every front page and newscast says everything you need to know about how journalism is failing us." created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 13:44:07 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/02/27/boozerAndLittleDave.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/09/19.html#a134407"/>

			<description>If anyone from MacArthur or Knight is tuned in, here's an idea. Help us get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ez-pass+for+news+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass for News&lt;/a&gt; going. It's a bootstrap. If there were incentives. If it were seen as a good cause. It could increase the fluidity of news around the country and world by an order of magnitude. That can't help but increase cash flow through news orgs. But more importantly it give us more access to ideas that don't come from the NYT et al. Might be a nice way to boost all the local news orgs being supported by the $500 million fund.</description>

			<title>Textcasting revisited</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; applies the philosophy of podcasting to text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also describes what we should have done when Twitter first came along, what I would have done if I were them. We would have had a much different situation now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Textcasting also says that all the tribulations of Activitypub aren't necessary. No one has bothered to think this through at the top level, everyone is working in niches, not really aware of what anyone else is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism also refused to look. So they were guided into a gulag by Twitter and now they don't like it. If anyone had thought through where they were going, that would have led to &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; too. They should have owned the new news environment, instead they and we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/trolls/#1515276557000&quot;&gt;controlled&lt;/a&gt; by it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that keeps me focused is writers. It's all about writers, what tools they need to think and collaborate, without boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a shame because if something you wrote is getting a lot of hits you can't tell where they're coming from. I'm sure there's a privacy reason for this. Perhaps if you were clicking a link from a porn site to a tech blog, you might not want the site to know where you came from, esp if the destination site is Facebook? Not sure. I've been noticing this for a long time, but only yesterday took the time to rule out a bug in my code.</description>

			<description>Yet another time Google pulled the rug out from under bloggers, acting as the defacto owner of the web. To big tech companies we just don't exist, probably because to news orgs we don't exist either. Not being able to tell where your stuff is being discussed means you can't learn or persuade. Maybe we should have a human network that manages to get links back to the blogger?</description>
