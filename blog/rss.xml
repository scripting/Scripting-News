			<title>Threads in Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones, for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An example of AI use</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 &quot;&gt;link to the response&lt;/a&gt;. I've heard that sometimes people have trouble accessing these files. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Slow down please</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://gemini.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/17/busCareeningDownMountainRoad.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Bus careening down mountain road.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My offer to Democrats in DC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A simple idea, a quid pro quo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate that we will support them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are the government of the US, Congress represents us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have been too passive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then, they have to include us in governing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No more shutting off the connection after the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seems like a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My post is my house</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can't moderate comments under your own posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone says something abusive, it's there for everyone to see, forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to feel respected.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.</description>

			<description>I’m not giving money to Democrats. I will give to campaigns that run hard-hitting ads telling the full truth about what Musk is doing now. I want to see the actual ads before I chip in, and will do so enthusiastically, but they can’t be anemic.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-Xbn92mXE&quot;&gt;two-minute demo&lt;/a&gt; of my new writing tool for Bluesky. This is quite a bit simpler than the last version, you log on directly to Bluesky, doesn't go through my server at all. This removes a whole layer of complexity for the user, and means a lot of people can use it without it having to scale up. Also made it simpler, more of a writing tool, closer to where I'd like this stuff to be when we have across-the-board textcasting support. Really focused on the flow for writers.</description>

			<title>The United States is not a Silicon Valley company</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had an experience few people have had, and it's relevant to the way all of us feel right now. The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company. I was the CEO. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn't work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don't take orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That's why Musk and Trump are having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works, because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have rights that must be respected. That &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be respected or all hell will break loose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you, the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you didn't have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the US, until they aren't a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren't going to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or young, LBGTQ or whatever -- we all are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state&quot;&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt;, ie we don't have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might take some getting used to by him). We don't take orders from him, or anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you're supposed to sit here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction. The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they're fucking with, and they don't want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short time because you can't be part of the disaster they're creating. And always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has done with Twitter, as we've seen many SV companies have. But again, for the 18th time, &lt;i&gt;the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn't know he had terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes men, they never would have told him. And he didn't want to hear it from a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large organizations are nothing compared with the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn't work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:31:39 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html#a153139"/>
				<source:outline text="There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don't take orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That's why Musk and Trump are having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works, because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have rights that must be respected. That &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be respected or all hell will break loose." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:11:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html#a141119"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you, the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you didn't have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the US, until they aren't a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren't going to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or young, LBGTQ or whatever -- we all are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state&quot;&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt;, ie we don't have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might take some getting used to by him). We don't take orders from him, or anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special circumstances." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:12:58 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html#a141258"/>
				<source:outline text="Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you're supposed to sit here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction. The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they're fucking with, and they don't want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short time because you can't be part of the disaster they're creating. And always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has done with Twitter, as we've seen many SV companies have. But again, for the 18th time, &lt;i&gt;the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley company.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:10:27 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html#a141027"/>
				<source:outline text="What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn't know he had terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes men, they never would have told him. And he didn't want to hear it from a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large organizations are nothing compared with the United States." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:17:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html#a141743"/>
				<source:outline text="And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:29:39 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html#a142939"/>

			<title>Trump and Trudeau chat</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/191367/trump-treasury-default-bond-market&quot;&gt;New Republic&lt;/a&gt; is beginning to think like Musk and Trump. But they have to think a bit more and ask how does this all tie together? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember you have to consider events that would normally be unthinkable. And believe that Trump isn't actually president of the United States in any sense of what that meant in the past. He is sitting in the seat of the president. He has the powers of the president, but he does not represent the interests of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's going to use the US Treasury and the power of the dollar as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#:~:text=A%20reserve%20currency%20is%20a,of%20their%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves.&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt;, to buy himself a few toys to play with, like Canada, Greenland, Gaza and Panama, to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, here's the text of an imaginary conversation between Trump and Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: Hey Justin, how's it going?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: You know, not so good.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: I get it. Have you considered my offer?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: Yes. Either we surrender and become the 51st state, or you won't honor Canadian deposits in the US Treasury. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: That's right my friend.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: I don't see how we have any choice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: I'm afraid that's correct. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: Semi-sarcastic: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and Canada. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: You can leave out the Canada part. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: You can't blame me for trying.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: Have a nice day. 😀&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nYgfV2oJA&amp;t=130s&quot;&gt;scene from Goodfellas&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates what's next for the former independent country of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Most of us did that. We’re going to do that soon re the overthrow of our government and looting of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude everything is normal. It’s not. We’re going to have to start shutting down all the services we can to make the point to our fellow citizens that we, the United States, are not coming back from this without major change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Musk roots the world economy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, that's just a theory, but I need to get your attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can do anything, install or uninstall anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mostly journalism has been reporting &quot;He has our social security numbers.&quot; Sigh. That's not nearly the problem folks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete debt. Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows those guys. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don't believe me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It's clever because it doesn't require soldiers, not one shot will be fired. My guess is that they already have this power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, here's SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table named inventory. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;delete from inventory where rand () &lt; 0.2;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the greatest depression ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21&quot;&gt;ask ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world economy. It's where people store their money.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I tried Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, none of them even understood the question of how to get Bluesky to add the data. I was amazed to learn that each developer has to do it for themselves, that this isn't something they built into their server. Anyway, I'm halfway there.</description>

The key was I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/bmann.ca/post/3lhluwhk6jk2g&quot;&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; how to do the equivalent of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdsls.dev/at/did:plc:dwaduijo6ngdgzmir5vovzrh/app.bsky.feed.post/3lhlwfuq2a22u&quot;&gt;View Source&lt;/a&gt; on a Bluesky post so I could see how others did it. I tried Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, none of them even understood the question of how to get Bluesky to add the data. I was amazed to learn that each developer has to do it for themselves, that this isn't something they built into their server. Anyway, I'm halfway there." created="Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:15:32 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/05/pinkyFacingLeft.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/07.html#a171532"/>

			<description>I wish Bluesky had just used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22twitter+api%22&quot;&gt;Twitter API&lt;/a&gt;. That's how I would've done it. Continuity matters a lot. And think of all time wasted at re-doing something we had working a long time ago.</description>

			<description>The AI world would have done much better with a president like Biden than we will with Trump. AI is a very potent tool for surveillance. Completely changes the game. And if it were just Trump and not Musk we'd have a chance, but Musk and Thiel fully understand the power, and probably already have all the code written, they just need the database records to scan and now they have all of them. Eventually we'll be talking about the &quot;peaceful uses of AI&quot; as we do about nuclear tech. But just saying that will get you punished.</description>

			<description>Another thing to watch while you still can, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others&quot;&gt;The Lives of Others&lt;/a&gt;, about life in East Germany during the Cold War.</description>

It was used to shame a Democrat who was doing a great job of explaining the danger, Sen Murphy of Connecticut. I switched to basketball in disgust, thinking these people, CNN, they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&quot;&gt;not serious people&lt;/a&gt;. This problem isn't on the Dems, it's on all of us, and it always was. To pin it on the Dems is to say it's hopeless because right now they're just our representatives in Congress and some of our state governments. We have a big problem and we probably can't dig out of it, but if we have any hope at all, orgs like CNN have to stop being such idiots. Every so often I see a spark of brilliance over there, and then one of these things happens. What's more depressing, Trump or CNN? CNN by a lot. And the NYT and all the rest of the broken media. We are all in the same boat.</description>

			<description>In January I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/myAppList/&quot;&gt;an online diary&lt;/a&gt; where I list each of the apps I manage, as I work on them. When I work on one, I move it to the top. The notes are brief and to anyone but me might seem cryptic. But at least you can follow what I'm doing. No I don't plan to do an RSS feed for it. It's just a place to keep track of all the things I work on, for people who I work with, and most important, me.</description>

			<description>A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nYgfV2oJA&amp;t=130s&quot;&gt;scene in Goodfellas&lt;/a&gt; where they explain what it's like to have Paulie the mob boss as a partner. In this scene Paulie is Musk. The restaurant owner is Trump. The United States is the restaurant.</description>
