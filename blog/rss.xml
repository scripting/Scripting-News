			<description>I wrote an app that implements &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpInbound&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; sites. Three months ago, a few little glitches but remarkably reliable. Open source. That's how I have scripting.com output hooked up to daveverse.org input. It stopped working this morning, not sure why. This is actually a test to see if this works. (Postscript: It did work. But I have two earlier posts today that did not get through.)</description>

			<description>We need a short name for &lt;i&gt;ChatGPT-like product.&lt;/i&gt; If I want to make a general statement about products in the category, there is, as far as I know, no word to use. Same with Twitter and tweet, so I call them &lt;i&gt;twitter-like&lt;/i&gt; products and use tweet for posts to any twitter-like product. The whole idea of a different name (like toot, skeet) for each service is linguistic travesty. Anyway, &lt;i&gt;ChatGPT-like&lt;/i&gt; is also an unacceptable term. If it had a fun name like OurMind -- then &lt;i&gt;OurMind-like&lt;/i&gt; would work. If only &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; were here.</description>

This started out just for desktop apps but worked just as well for web apps, once that opportunity became available. I felt strongly that the Mac with it's very functional GUI could benefit from a powerful system-level scripting language with the UI objects being scriptable, and the data of the apps accessible via script. That kind of duality is still a common theme in computer work, I'm doing the same kind of thing with WordPress, as the OS for the web, and making it possible to create different UIs in ways that earlier social web apps can't. I think that functionality as with the others will pair very nicely with ChatGPT and its cousins.</description>

Looking at the list and realize we got all those people to work together. They don't talk about that when the write the history, but that is the real accomplishment. There is so much really good tech that ends up lost to history because people wouldn't open their eyes and see that they weren't alone. That might be the biggest flaw in the design of our species, that it's so rare that we get together on the way things should work. Other examples -- MP3, QuickDraw, HTML.  And so much time wasted replacing things that already worked fine. (Think of all the programming languages invented in the last 20 years. What a waste of resources. No doubt the AI's have already created a meta-language to compile all that code into. If they could think, what would they think of us for not paying attention to each other.)</description>

			<description>I have an array built into every app I do, on server or in the browser, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/679fe7641178a7946f4b8aab806e0360f85f960d/daveutils.js#L828&quot;&gt;snarkySlogans&lt;/a&gt;. When I need a bit of text to test with I just choose a random snarky slogan. They are little truths that have occurred to me over the years. You're free to steal this code, they do come in handy at times. There's a snarky slogan to cover that -- &quot;Only steal from the best.&quot; Another one I really like: &quot;Just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right.&quot;</description>
