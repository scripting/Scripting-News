It's all about WordPress, a product that you won't read much about on this blog, going back through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't paying attention until 2023 when I began to see what an amazing product it is, not just for 2004 when it came out, but in 2024. My theory is that it's the basis for an incredible social web platform, much better than Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky and of course Twitter. That's what I'm talking about for 1/2 hour in this podcast. If you give me that much time, I'll change the way you see the world, or at least the way you see me. I think I'm right about this, with another layer on top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of WordPress. The fact that they aren't gives a clue as to how portable your work is there, and how little choice you get in writing tools. Anyway, please make the time to listen. This is pivotal, and I don't think I'll ever be able to spell it out in writing, it's pure storytelling. Thanks!</description>

			<description>Just found an exponential memory leak at the database level in Bingeworthy. I have never seen one of these in all my years of programming. A data structure that saves a copy of itself in itself. So every time it saved it became exponentially bigger. Until it made the SQL server crash because the JSON object it was storying was over the limit of JSON objects. Crashed the freaking server. Fixed. Feels good.</description>

			<description>As part of the conversion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, I started the database from scratch, but before I did that, I exported &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/tree/master/data&quot;&gt;all the data&lt;/a&gt; and put it in a GitHub repo. This included a JSON file of ratings for each user. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/users/davewiner.json&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my file. Remember we used Twitter identity then, &lt;i&gt;davewiner&lt;/i&gt; is my Twitter username, just replace my name with yours to see your file, if you were a Bingeworthy user in the past.</description>

Now that Zuckerberg has thrown us under the bus, again, it's worth remembering their rollout strategy was to get us to overlook their past betrayals of users. They said &quot;We ❤️ Fediverse.&quot; That did it. It was at a moment of fear of Twitter, now owned by Musk, and a belief in the story of ActivityPub, that it would create an open social web. Zuck said &quot;we're on board.&quot; Now it's expedient to say to another group that he sees things their way, and it just so happens to be the very people most people who were looking to get away from in 2023 when he was loving the Fediverse. Now we're doing the same thing with Bluesky. And &lt;i&gt;it's going to happen again. &lt;/i&gt;There will be a moment when you look back on your &quot;hope for the best&quot; approach and realize that it didn't work, and if I'm around I will remind you again. We have to roll up our sleeves and make an &lt;i&gt;open social web&lt;/i&gt; that can't be sold out. When you build value for other people, they will use it for their advantage, leaving you with nothing. That's business. There are no companies that are different, not Apple, not anyone.

			<description>I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing with ten years ago. And they could have removed features from the language instead of piling on more and more random reinventions. End of editorial, now on with the new Bingeworthy.</description>

			<title>The new Bingeworthy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all of a sudden new items started appearing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;the new Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought oh geez there's some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but quickly realized &lt;i&gt;someone was using it&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;it was working. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with first, and I wanted to fix up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/bingeworthy/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, such as they are, but I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the TwitterPocalypse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; is the app I missed the most that hadn't been ported off Twitter identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you're getting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The most important features are there, although they don't necessarily look that great. I want to do some more work there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you have any questions or problems, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on the Mac in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There's a slight typo, but rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to find. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/07/bingeworthyLogoForScriptingNews.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The all-new logo for Bingeworthy, via ChatGPT of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In 2025 we'd use AI to find the threads in our writing, to maintain a book outline that changes as our writing goes forward. Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started. I've yet to use a ChatGPT-like service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for writing this kind of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand. I would write a post about a feature as I thought about it, but not worry about how it fits into the rest of the book. Trust the AI organizer to help us do something sensible.</description>

They even thought of using RSS constructs and decided to reinvent the whole thing.

That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet.</description>

There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; where everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;gets&lt;/a&gt; to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet." created="Sun, 05 Jan 2025 15:46:58 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/05.html#a154658"/>

			<description>BTW, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/01/03.html#a010024&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;, last night's Knicks game was great. Up until the end, when the other guys took over and sadly the Knicks lost. We need a stronger bench. The starting five are great but they're not totally super-human.</description>

			<title>Gambling, sports, kids</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman writes&lt;/a&gt; about social media is poisoning children's minds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like that Krugman has resumed his blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that sometimes I agree or disagree, or have mixed opinions, but I always learn something. That's what makes a blogger good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I agree that children's minds are being poisoned. But I am pretty sure when people like Krugman and myself reach a certain age, and we are the same age, we start looking at new media that way. Maybe &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; minds are poisoned. My father called television the &quot;idiot box.&quot; But it eventually became the literature of my generation, often very good. But maybe laws can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the NFL, MLB and tennis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And is this why they can now afford to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-agrees-to-contract-with-mets&quot;&gt;sign players&lt;/a&gt; to $765 million contracts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're all getting hugely rich, but I believe that they are certainly doing great harm to the new sports fans growing up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a math major and a 50+ year programmer, and I know that if you gamble enough you lose all your money. And as an addiction no gambler ever gets up from the table to enjoy their winnings when they win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in WordLand on New Years Day, saving it for a good moment on Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Little Feed Reader on Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;little feed reader&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lerbu7ugvc2i&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/a&gt; for you to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is how the pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;i&gt;blogroll&lt;/i&gt; category on feedland.social to determine what's posted on Bluesky. When I add or remove feeds from the category, the OPML adjusts dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm running a new Node app that has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/websocket&quot;&gt;websocket&lt;/a&gt; connection to feedland.social. It receives all the new items as they are found from all feeds over the socket. It's feedland.social's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/firehose-api/&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt;. Since I'm currently the only user of that server, it's getting news from the all feeds I follow, not just the ones in the blogroll category. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app checks each new item to see if it's in one of the feeds in the OPML list. If so, it reformats it to fit in a Bluesky post and sends it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;feediverse account&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're subscribed you should see the item, with a link, in your Bluesky timeline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app re-loads the OPML subscription list every minute so any change is quickly reflected.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; you &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/expandedBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog's home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; in getting this running was rate-limiting. I have dealt with this on Twitter and other services, but Bluesky was not, for a while, letting anything through with the error message that we were over the limit. It was suggested that we should cache the accessToken rather get a new one for every message. I did that and cautiously turned the server on again at first with a 5 message per hour self-imposed limit, then gradually increased it to 10 per hour. The latest version only requires that there be at least five minutes between posts, so that means no more than 12 per hour. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lerhvj52pk27&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt; for the initial idea and his support. He saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and asked if it could work in Bluesky. That was the idea. I have always wanted a tight coupling between Bluesky and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; but didn't know how to do it. We may have just skipped a step. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We realllly could use some more formating features in Bluesky messages. This is a really strong use-case imho for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The coolest thing from my point of view is that I already had all the pieces, fully developed, the only thing that remained was to hook them together. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/feediverse/bluesky/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for Little Feed Reader. It's purposely brief, but I have put a link to this post on that page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; and edited a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;complete blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a response to something &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman wrote&lt;/a&gt;, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso&quot;&gt;Marge said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Fargo. &quot;There's more to life than a little money, you know.&quot; It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper&quot;&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.</description>
