My favorite scene in the last episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenrant.com/severance-season-2-episode-6-why-helena-followed-mark-to-restaurant/&quot;&gt;took place&lt;/a&gt; at a Chinese restaurant. Anyway, I was just listening to the latest episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s2e6-attila-with-christopher-walken-and-sarah-bock/id1788381175?i=1000694662565&quot;&gt;Severance podcast&lt;/a&gt;, about this episode, which you should definitely listen to if you like me love the show. They have an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken&quot;&gt;Christopher Walken&lt;/a&gt; who plays &lt;a href=&quot;https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Burt_Goodman&quot;&gt;Burt&lt;/a&gt;. Amazing stuff. But even more amazing is that I learned in the podcast that the restaurant mentioned earlier is actually a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engsrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Kingston restaurant&lt;/a&gt; that just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/food/article/engs-chinese-restaurant-kingston-opens-dining-room-20058303.php&quot;&gt;re-opened&lt;/a&gt; after a long hiatus, so I've not yet had a chance to eat there, but I want to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engsrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Eng's&lt;/a&gt;. This, after learning that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ny.eater.com/2025/1/27/24350496/severance-pips-phoenicia-diner-catskills&quot;&gt;the diner&lt;/a&gt; that's in two scenes, one in each season, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoeniciadiner.com/&quot;&gt;Phoenicia Diner&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite local eating places.</description>

			<title>Me at 22 in Madison</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Me as a grad student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW-Madison&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 or so, programming on a Unix system, probably working on my first outliner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that the terminal I was using had uppercase and lowercase letters. This was a big innovation! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11&quot;&gt;PDP-11/45&lt;/a&gt; to write in C. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=213461068861306&amp;set=a.113966572144090&quot;&gt;comment thread&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lived in a big house with 10 roommates. And as weird as it must seem from the point of view of 2025, I was the only one who used a computer. I would tell them all the time that we'd all use computers someday. They rolled their eyes and smiled. &quot;There goes Dave again.&quot; The reason I was so sure was email and writing tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/27/daveAtTheTerminal.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Me at 22 in Madison.

I wrote the other day that I feel like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153833&quot;&gt;time traveler&lt;/a&gt;, discovering WordPress 20 years after I left UserLand. I care that it's open source, but I care much more that it's open web esp after we've been so thoroughly dominated by feature-limited silos such as Twitter, Facebook and yes -- even Mastodon and Bluesky. Even if there's a theoretical way to do it, practically speaking we have to wait for their developers to implement the features we want. Open source doesn't help there, but open web does. Matt puts the emphasis on the open source part, that's why it wasn't until very recently that I realized that &lt;i&gt;open web&lt;/i&gt; is more important, to me at least.</description>

			<title>Death panel</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel&quot;&gt;death panel&lt;/a&gt; as described by Republican lawmakers as they fought the Affordable Care Act. I was surprised it was willing to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to the bot: &quot;The concept of 'death panels' was a widely debunked political talking point used by opponents of the Affordable Care Act. It falsely suggested that government-run committees would decide whether individuals—especially the elderly or disabled—would receive life-saving care. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can generate an image depicting a grim, dystopian bureaucratic setting where a group of shadowy officials in suits are sitting at a long, dark table, stamping papers while an elderly patient looks on with concern. The room would have a cold, sterile look, with a looming clock symbolizing bureaucratic power over life and death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/26/deathPanel.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Death panel, as imagined by ChatGPT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It was short, but the thinking behind it wasn't. Here's the quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It might be the last minute but we can still legally remove Trump, and objectively it’s the only thing that makes any sense.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got two responses from &lt;a href=&quot;https://muckrack.com/karoli-kuns&quot;&gt;Karoli Kuns&lt;/a&gt;, an early blogger, and editor at Crooks and Liars, a long-lived blog that if I recall correctly was started with software I wrote in 2002, so I feel some pride in helping in a small way to enable her accomplishments and contributions, which are long-lived and substantial. Both of her responses missed the sadness in my post, the reflectiveness, but rather did what a lot of arguing online devolves to, showing someone else that their thinking is wrong. I couldn't think straight I was so angry, so I just said no, I'm not going to do this. Lots of experience trying to explain myself in little 300-character bursts, there's no reason to add to the grief of the moment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But this morning I opened up my Bluesky window and started typing. What came out was far too long to post there, and even a screen shot doesn't fit in the space allotted, so my only choice is to blog it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3liyx4zmogs26&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; a link on Bluesky. I hope she reads it, because we're not out of options, and as I say in this story, we should be working together, and as far as I know we are not. I say this to everyone I think is making a contribution, my belief that if we can steer our efforts so they are complementary we can square each others' power. It's imho the beginning of our way out of this situation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is what I wrote. (Note when writing this stuff I tend not to capitalize, a lazy habit I have developed. I decided not to edit that here, just to leave it as it was written.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;karoli -- there's a lot to say about this, and i don't like arguing on social networks, and it was late, and i didn't feel like getting into it with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;anyway i wrote what i wrote not as a plan but rather a note that we're passing a line, over which there soon won't be any recourse. we probably are already over the line, but if by some miracle the repubs saw clearly that this was the last chance and enough of them decided to do what so far they have been unwilling to do, there would be a fight. i wasn't saying i thought it was likely, which is what your rebuttals were rebutting, i was just sharing a sad observation that i had made earlier in the day when i was thinking this through. i like to do that because it's part of my creativity. sometimes you think of the ideal answer, and it leads you back to an acceptable answer -- in software design and in writing (which is what i do pretty well with lots of experience).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;what was really frustrating is that i think you and i should be collaborating. giving me grief over something so ridiculous was about 180 degrees opposite of where i think we should be. that we are still doing this to each other, gives an idea of how we got here. the democrats pick on classes of people, sometimes destroying their lives, and big surprise -- a lot of them vote for the other party. i think you think you can dis me the way you did because of my gender, or age, or race, or who the fuck knows. and for all i know you were just having a bad moment and decided to share it with me for some reason having nothing to do with what was bothering me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;karoli -- i think we have to bend over backwards to be kind to each other. we're all going through a terrible time, in ways that may not be obvious. i certainly am, and i don't want to share it with you, but it comes on top of the crazy uncertainty of the political world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;anyway that's my response, and maybe now you can see why, as the day was winding down and i was watching some basketball on tv, i didn't feel like getting into it with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the struggle isn't over -- they had antiwar demonstrations in russia, a country that has the kind of government ours is about to become. and the sooner we accept the new reality and get smart about it, and i'm not talking about the repubs, i'm talking about us, the shorter the nightmare will be imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An afterthought -- the reason it makes sense for the Repubs to join us in removing Trump is the turn away from democratic Europe and toward the authoritarians. &lt;i&gt;This just happened,&lt;/i&gt; and it's shocking. We don't even know how to think of ourselves. If I were a Republican, I would think my world just turned upside down. They didn't believe it would come to this, as far as I can tell. So it may be a time when real change is possible. We've become so fatalistic that we couldn't even recognize such an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/02/what-would-a-liberal-tea-party-look-like/681819/&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; in a story yesterday what a liberal &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement&quot;&gt;tea party movement&lt;/a&gt; would look like. They're doing it too. We should create an &lt;i&gt;American&lt;/i&gt; tea party. We're so addicted to divides we can't see when we're doing it ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, having explained all that was overlooked in my simple idea, if we managed to remove Trump, what part of your mind thinks we wouldn't also remove Vance? Geez Louise. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I didn't buy that assumption that WordPress has to be heavy machinery for writers. What if I just want to write something quickly and get back to the other thing I was working on. Also the edit box in WordLand starts out the size of a tiny little text box, but grows as you add more words. You are allowed to keep going. No character limit.</description>

			<description>Just saw a report that styling isn't working in WordLand in latest versions of Safari. We're using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;MediumEditor&lt;/a&gt; to do the editing. Did a quick query in Claude.ai and there do appear to be some compatibility issues with Safari. A request that people actually report these problems in the repo, via the Support link in the main menu, otherwise it's hit or miss. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Since Bluesky gave us the ability to limit responses to people I follow, the amount of spam/abuse has been reduced to a trickle. People can still comment, by quoting my post. But they want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, to gain exposure to my followers. Helping promote &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; ideas is not their idea of fun.</description>

			<title>Day 4 of WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Aziz Poonawalla wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://azizhp.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/7482/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of WordLand. I'd like to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I'd like to say I put a lot of thought into this product, so it is the way it is for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a writing world where we get the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. So your belief that the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I'm not saying limits in software aren't good. A product is as much defined by what it can't do as with what it does. All feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it finds in feeds, because RSS doesn't place any limits what you can use. So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed reading software, I've said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who does &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;, and he was quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element in your feeds and in your feed reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You say there's no use-case -- but there is a use-case, just not for you which is fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a shame that is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, imho, is exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. They were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some reason they didn't. It's so weird to me, I'm like a time traveler who has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of a product like WordPress. It's supposed to be a place writers love to come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It's just a beginning, there's lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to anywhere begins with one step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to Bluesky and Mastodon -- because they both support outbound RSS, we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of published feeds. I fully intend to integrate features from FeedLand in WordLand. That's why the names are so similar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that you like &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, this isn't in the way of it and it isn't in the way of WordLand. I'm in regular contact with Manton, and if his product grows, I win because he's got the right model. He's still trying to work with the limited platforms and I, again, gave up. That right there defines the two products. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate my writing because I couldn't use links, and I couldn't edit or have more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and I had to make a choice. I'm doing it again, but now have made the investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they didn't. Should I give up there? Maybe. Maybe we were destined to give up on the web as a writer's platform. But I saw so much potential there in 1994 when I started working here exclusively. That potential is still very much there, you just have to believe, and against all odds, I do still believe. One more time, let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's okay if you don't use it, but I wanted to disagree with some of your conclusions. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote every word on this page, not an AI bot, in case you were wondering. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Aziz Poonawalla wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://azizhp.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/7482/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of WordLand. I'd like to respond." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:31:57 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153157"/>
				<source:outline text="First, I'd like to say I put a lot of thought into this product, so it is the way it is for good reason." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:32:55 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153255"/>
				<source:outline text="I'm trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a writing world where we get the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. So your belief that the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:33:25 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153325"/>
				<source:outline text="On the other hand, I'm not saying limits in software aren't good. A product is as much defined by what it can't do as with what it does. All feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it finds in feeds, because RSS doesn't place any limits what you can use. So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed reading software, I've said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who does &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;, and he was quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element in your feeds and in your feed reader." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:34:32 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153432"/>

				<source:outline text="The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a shame that is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, imho, is exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. They were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some reason they didn't. It's so weird to me, I'm like a time traveler who has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of a product like WordPress. It's supposed to be a place writers love to come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It's just a beginning, there's lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to anywhere begins with one step." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:38:33 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153833"/>
				<source:outline text="Back to Bluesky and Mastodon -- because they both support outbound RSS, we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of published feeds. I fully intend to integrate features from FeedLand in WordLand. That's why the names are so similar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:44:21 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a154421"/>
				<source:outline text="It's good that you like &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, this isn't in the way of it and it isn't in the way of WordLand. I'm in regular contact with Manton, and if his product grows, I win because he's got the right model. He's still trying to work with the limited platforms and I, again, gave up. That right there defines the two products." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:45:14 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a154514"/>
				<source:outline text="Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate my writing because I couldn't use links, and I couldn't edit or have more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and I had to make a choice. I'm doing it again, but now have made the investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:46:06 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a154606"/>
				<source:outline text="My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they didn't. Should I give up there? Maybe. Maybe we were destined to give up on the web as a writer's platform. But I saw so much potential there in 1994 when I started working here exclusively. That potential is still very much there, you just have to believe, and against all odds, I do still believe. One more time, let's give it a try." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:47:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a154743"/>

			<title>Day 3 of WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post that needed to be on the blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The groundrules here are -- if you see a problem in the support group and you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's important to develop a community here if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; is going to gain users, and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for blazing a new trail. If it's just me, the results are predictable and not good -- I'm one old man here, with limited capability. The product still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think the result will be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to bootstrap something new -- a social network without all the problems of Twitter et al. Ultimately the limits they impose on writers are unacceptable. I've waited for them to fix these problems for 18 years now, and I've come to see, amazingly, they don't see them as problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into 300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call it the web? (End of editorial.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides, reading and writing. We've got reading covered from a technical standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my stuff with others, &lt;i&gt;easily.&lt;/i&gt; Unlike the twitter-like systems, which are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn't actually work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion and stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical form. Makes sure WL's idea of a category is a good match with WP's. I am a very casual WordPress user as you can see from &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;my test site&lt;/a&gt;. I like the template, but it has errors in it. I don't plan on becoming a WordPress expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all kinds of other stuff where I'm the only expert. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting in 2001. There's absolutely no question it's the consensus platform for web publishing. There are others, but the one that's most deeply installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It's a 20+ year thing, and they've done an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; job of maintaining compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the consensus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It's an important time when help is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Rather than wait for ActivityPub and AT Proto to get their acts together. I think we can do it with feeds and start off with &lt;i&gt;immediate&lt;/i&gt; interop without the complexity of federation. I call it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse&lt;/a&gt;. It's not a joke, although it may incite a smile and a giggle. And that's ok.</description>

Nah I think it's all for him, with a taste going to the Trump and Putin families. He's going to use his new power to buy something else. The question is what? What else could he want?

			<title>Templates for Bluesky?</title>

			<title>Who is Elon Musk?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalism is as usual writing news they could have written last year and should have if they weren't dreaming that somehow we'd escape End of Democracy 2.0. And we know how that turned out, about the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Hillary%27s%20Emails%22&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who is Elon Musk? Until I read his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk&quot;&gt;Wikipedia profile&lt;/a&gt; last week, I only had a vague idea. I wanted to know if he was actually raised in South Africa, when he left, and what influence it had on him. I'll let you read the article. We should be examining every nook and cranny of who this unelected guy who never was in a debate, or won a primary or an election, or had his background investigated, and remains untouched by any kind of examination. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His security detail was just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/elon-musk-private-security-deputized-marshals-service/index.html&quot;&gt;deputized&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmarshals.gov/&quot;&gt;US Marshals Service&lt;/a&gt;. What next? Maybe they'll just give him control of the military and get on with it. You can see that's coming, maybe in March, or sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do you think he'd have any &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compunction&quot;&gt;compunction&lt;/a&gt; against using the military against Americans? This isn't his country. So Americans probably mean nothing special to him. Since we played a role in the overthrow of their apartheid, probably the opposite. I wonder who or what he cares about. Has he ever answered a question without deflecting? Is there any reporter who could or would interview him? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If journalism were really doing their job seriously, they would report on this because this is what we're thinking. When will jouralism get that they are one of us, not above us? The sooner that light goes on, the better.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a good story for one of fierce courageous reporters at the NY Times. Who should be more scared of what's coming? Blacks or Jews?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's really hard to see the resemblance between today's Eddie and young Eddie, but there it was, the comic brilliance. Then they ask the real Tracy if they are related and he said he doesn't see it.</description>

			<description>Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; disappoint you. Don't blame them when it happens, because they can't be as good as people think they are. They're a startup in a tough market. Sooner or later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards. There isn't one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise up, give them a little the Rachel we love.</description>

The idea that it's some kind of conversation -- no it really doesn't resemble a conversation. I would like to try a social network that didn't have the concept of replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn't be able to insert something into someone else's flow, which is where all the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the person it's in reply to, so you don't end up getting speeches under your posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don't bother reading anything that's related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can enter the flow. We've been doing this, the way we do it, since the inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics, specifically graph theory -- and the Twitter way of organizing people and discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged. Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can't intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Give each other a little more distance. It still would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn't be able to insert something into someone else's flow, which is where all the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the person it's in reply to, so you don't end up getting speeches under your posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don't bother reading anything that's related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can enter the flow. We've been doing this, the way we do it, since the inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics, specifically graph theory -- and the Twitter way of organizing people and discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged. Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can't intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 20 Feb 2025 03:07:37 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/goodhumortruck.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/19.html#a030737"/>

			<description>One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck. And she's talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it's going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all get that, and that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are part of it, the better things will turn out, imho.</description>

			<title>Threads in Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones, for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An example of AI use</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 &quot;&gt;link to the response&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Slow down please</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://gemini.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/17/busCareeningDownMountainRoad.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Bus careening down mountain road.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My offer to Democrats in DC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A simple idea, a quid pro quo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate that we will support them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are the government of the US, Congress represents us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have been too passive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then, they have to include us in governing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No more shutting off the connection after the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seems like a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can't moderate comments under your own posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone says something abusive, it's there for everyone to see, forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to feel respected.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.</description>

			<description>I’m not giving money to Democrats. I will give to campaigns that run hard-hitting ads telling the full truth about what Musk is doing now. I want to see the actual ads before I chip in, and will do so enthusiastically, but they can’t be anemic.</description>

Alas it was all on its own, didn't work with anything but itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot was lost because the Mac development model was far in advance of what existed on the web, and it was well-thought-out unlike the app model of the web, which is a hodgepodge of horribly designed modules that don't work well together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a Mac developer at the time, so I know a lot about this moment of history. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/15/hypercardStackHome.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Screen shot of a Hypercard stack home page.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
