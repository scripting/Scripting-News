			<description>I've been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;claude.ai&lt;/a&gt; for programming work lately, and it does one thing better than ChatGPT. It reads your code and tries to mimic your coding style. ChatGPT won't do that. It's really frustrating to have to edit their code before I can even try it out. I like it and am paying the $20 per month in addition to the money I'm paying ChatGPT.</description>

Let someone else ride around in this car that I love, but hate because it is a symbol of American terrorism and apartheid.  This is compatible with my understanding that hate is love that was betrayed. I'm sure I won't love its replacement as much as I loved the Model Y, but I will feel better about driving it. And Tesla shareholders will, I hope, learn the lesson that products must be politically agnostic in order to work commercially. Or if you must take a stand, make it &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; fascism. So many of our oligarchs have made the wrong bet here. We will never forget what Zuckerberg, Bezos, the CEOs of Apple, Microsoft, Open AI -- all these companies went the wrong way.</description>

			<title>Advice to would-be platform vendors</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: The key to success is convincing developers to ignore the fact that you will eventually kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would-be platform vendors, open or not, in order to entice a developer to learn how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Quick success. Hello World works in less than 30 minutes. Hopefully much less.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Easy to believe that the platform vendor won't want to kill me. This is a trick, because based on my experience, they always try to kill you, eventually. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fun. If I can fill a need that I think users will want, without being resented too much by the platform vendor then I might take a jump knowing full well that the better the idea the quicker the vendor will kill me. For that reason it's better to do something they don't understand, or will see as irrelevant, ie a &quot;third party opportunity.&quot; As soon as it appears to be &quot;system software,&quot; that's when they started the project to eat your lunch. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The API works the way you think. This has been the highest hurdle for me to get over in most platforms I think about working with. I can't tell you how many times I've stared at the docs for a platform and have no idea how it relates to the product, which I know how to use. The concepts should mirror the functionality of the system it's the API for. Too much theory and I have to be very very motivated for other reasons to get through the fog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It must be relatively easy for you to hang out in a corner where it's too hard for them to be worth the trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thing is if there is a platform vendor, they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; kill you, no matter what they say. I once had a big platform vendor say they weren't trying to crush me. I could see on his face he realized he had just given up their plan, or how else would that term be in his head as applied to me. Never mind, I was already commited so what difference did it make. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason for all this is that as they grow, platform vendors hire employees to work on this stuff, and they resent independent developers. This surprised me when I first encountered it. I thought we were siblings, brothers and sisters. But they idealize our situation and only see the pain in theirs. So they will enjoy killing you. It will eventually happen. That's why it's generally much better if there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22platform+without+a+platform+vendor%22+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;no platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Good oligarchs and bad oligarchs. We need to help the good ones have the guts to get on the air, with really good creative advertising, telling the people exactly what's being done to them now, without pulling any punches. They have to be warned and they aren't. You have to be paying a lot of attention to understand. And it's hard to know what to believe. We have to have a voice in this, now.</description>

			<description>We're programmed to believe big companies make things the right way and individual people can't be trusted. We're going to have to break out of that rut, to stop trusting them so much. It's like the 2008 banking crisis, but this time they've taken over the government, not just the economy. The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that stopped the Vietnam war, btw). I got into computers because I thought I could earn a living that way, but quickly discovered how inherently subversive they are. They weren't just for the nerds with the plastic pocket protectors, they were also for hippies. Some of us are still here and we want to create with you.</description>

			<title>Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Could what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk&quot;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt; to Twitter, happen there?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would you switch to?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would you have to give up your history and followers?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are repeating the mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way twitter's was.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This started as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky of course. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Spoiler -- Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not billionaire-proof. It's going to get acquired, it probably already has, based on what they're doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do, not what they say. It's just as true in tech as it is in politics, and these days, what's the difference anyway? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If you're thinking ahh but there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol&quot;&gt;AT Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, our ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; too. It didn't make a difference. And AT Proto won't either unless there are proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky's servers, so those users can't be sold to the billionaire. We're nowhere near that. No one can say with any certainty that it's even possible. At this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it and the users and developers would have no recourse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn't take $20 million each for their share? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Rivers on Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I've been doing feed readers for a long time. They've been mostly organized around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like systems work. My rivers are built around &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and formats that interop with RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Then I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn't make sense, but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do -- I offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don't need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn't be reading this. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- he said &quot;I'd use that if it were on Bluesky.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first thought, ridiculous -- can't be done. They have all these limits that aren't present in HTML. I don't have any idea how I could make this work. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what a river looks like in FeedLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand's outbound news flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social&quot;&gt;an account on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, who linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers. It uses the list of feeds in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it's a really good pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it's going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I've gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have two new rivers on Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;dave.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt; -- the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave&quot;&gt;Dave tab&lt;/a&gt; on my news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog, Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;first new river&lt;/a&gt; I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has 10 followers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;nba.feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt; -- then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA. I'm a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track record of current management, I'm a totally happy campter. If we won a championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the wilderness, it's so nice to finally after all this time to have a great NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don't count). Anyway, there's nothing more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;here's&lt;/a&gt; what you follow. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing -- no federation here folks. It's very simple. No new formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for Atom and RDF too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I hadn't thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers. All we need now is Markdown support, and then a &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;few more things&lt;/a&gt;, and we'll be back to where we were in 1997. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I've been doing feed readers for a long time. They've been mostly organized around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like systems work.

				<source:outline text="Then I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn't make sense, but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do -- I offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don't need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn't be reading this. :-)" created="Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:18:09 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/27/161656.html#a161809"/>

				<source:outline text="My first thought, ridiculous -- can't be done. They have all these limits that aren't present in HTML. I don't have any idea how I could make this work. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what a river looks like in FeedLand." created="Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:20:52 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/27/161656.html#a162052"/>
				<source:outline text="But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try." created="Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:38:33 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/27/161656.html#a163833"/>
				<source:outline text="So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand's outbound news flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social&quot;&gt;an account on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, who linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers. It uses the list of feeds in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it's a really good pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it's going to stay running for the indefinite future.

			<title>What is a sanctuary city?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if people understand what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city&quot;&gt;sanctuary city&lt;/a&gt; is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are people living in the city who are not there legally. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that would create much larger problems. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens, to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to the feds. If they didn't guarantee that, the kids wouldn't be in school, and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It's a core principle of this country that educated citizens are a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education. What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for Republicans, one they probably wouldn't want to answer truthfully.) &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but that is not what's going on. You couldn't run a city with huge crimes commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people don't know what it means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Trump incites mob</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I kept this screenshot assuming someday we might be asked to forget. Back when the NYT tried sometimes to report the news as it actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/24/trumpIncitesMobNYT.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Trump incites mob. Capitol evacuated. A day which will live in infamy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Objectively, January 6, 2021 was even more of a &quot;day which will live in infamy&quot; than the Japanese attack on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/pearl-harbor-december-7-1941&quot;&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on December 7, 1941.   It was more insidious because while Hawaii was an American territory, January 6 was an attack on the actual center of our government. Had the mob prevailed, the US would have been defeated, there and then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Capitol police were our last line of defense, they received no help from military. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court should count their blessings too, because their building is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/United+States+Capitol,+Washington,+DC+20004/Supreme+Court+of+the+United+States,+1+First+St+NE,+Washington,+DC+20543/@38.8904572,-77.0093201,992m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b828d32c69bb:0xffb704728ee19592!2m2!1d-77.0044398!2d38.8906424!3e2?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;just behind&lt;/a&gt; the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I forgot that I have two ready-made answers. First, let's get the Democrats or whatever its successor is called, on the air 365 days a year, every year, not just in election years, and have it do many things other than raise money to buy ads. We need to always be communicating with each other not just in season. You could see we had a problem when Obama's campaign website, which should have become whitehouse.gov was turned into a stupid feature of the site where people could petition their government. It said to voters, thanks we'll take it from here. We all saw that as putting us in our place. We must be invoved in governing, not just electing. Second, for podcasts and what's left of journalism, it should all move out out of the northeast and into the country. The hosts should be in St Louis, Dallas, Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle, Phoenix even Memphis, Miami and Charleston. That would change the focus not only symbolically, but they could insist that guests go there to be interviewed. Change the meaning of flyover country. People would feel different about the country and that would come through. Democrats tend to cater their ideas to people in the Northeast. This part of what Repubs say is very true. They do the same thing, only worse, but they are smart about pretending they don't. Third, amplify AOC. She's the leader we need. The Dems are too scared of Republican criticism. Stop worrying so much. If they're complaining that means it's working. Her interview on Jon Stewart's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/867-the-weekly-show-with-jon-s-86469341/episode/jon-aoc-260531325/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; this week is wonderful.</description>

			<description>Another idea. One of Tesla's competitors could offer a trade-in, where they commit to recycling all the parts of your Tesla, so you are actually taking a Tesla off the road. And for a few extra dollars they can send you a scrapbook of your old Tesla being &lt;i&gt;lovingly&lt;/i&gt; taken apart suitable for RT'ing.</description>

			<title>We did nothing and now we pay</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most depressing moment of Trump 1.0, for me, was leaving the local supermarket, after seeing the kind of empty shelves you see in third world countries with broken or non-existent economic systems. This was when it sunk in how far the United States had fallen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/01/11/klaesAshford.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;But somehow those of us who survived Covid could relax on January 20, four years ago -- which was also coincidentally the day I got my first Covid vaccination -- the nightmare was over. We could relax for at least a few months before paying the price that was sure to come when we cleaned the mess that Trump had created with his January 6 insurrection. The question was will there be a war over this? Well, I reasoned, as I assumed the incoming president would, that it's better if you have to fight a civil war to do it when the military is responsible to you. But then a few months turned into a couple of years, and nothing happened. No indictments. He hadn't been arrested. I thought geez if we had done something like what he did, the scale of it, the audacity, the terror, my god how could he be left to walk around as if nothing had happened. I figured there must be a reason and our president had a plan. He didn't. Neither did journalism. When Trump ran for re-election he got the consideration any major party candidate would get from the press. As he is getting now as a newly sworn-in president. But we know his oath is meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that day when the shelves were empty is now only the second worst day, and yesterday I was still living with the respite of a four year trance of normality, as if all it took was belief that somehow we'd get through this. But now it's so depressing. I feel both like dying and living at the same time. I know many others feel this way. I don't imagine too many of the people who voted for Trump are full of joy right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we get another shot at cleaning this up, we must not let that opportunity slip by. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Bingeworthy + WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/12/10/thisIsNextYear.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I spent a few days designing and implementing the protocol that allows WordLand to be the writing tool for Bingeworthy, thus giving it a real writing and publishing function, instead of the usual ridiculous tiny little textbox. Today I'm going to make it work for writing and reading actual reviews for shows I have opinions about. I've always wanted to do this in a way that it's not just scattered into the wind, to rely on Google to find it again. Now I'll be able to scatter it, and also have it maintained in context, where it can help me remember what I liked about a show, and why perhaps I gave it an excellent rating when some parts really sucked. This was something that was missing in Bingeworthy, I knew it -- just didn't know how to make it work. Now I think I have it working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the flow:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Bingeworthy, I rate a program. Then I realize I want to say more, I want to write a review that explains the rating.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I click on the &lt;i&gt;Review in WordLand&lt;/i&gt; button. The bingeworthy client asks for a token from the bingeworthy server. The token is is part of the database record for the user's rating of the program being displayed.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The button switches me over to WordLand using window.open, along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/3b3c17e974882409ebf0f715a6f4f1b3&quot;&gt;package of data&lt;/a&gt; that gives the editor all the info it needs to update the post when published. It's worth clicking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/3b3c17e974882409ebf0f715a6f4f1b3&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to see the data involved. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In WordLand, I see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/18/useWordland.png&quot;&gt;dialog&lt;/a&gt; confirming that I want to write a review for Bingeworthy. If I approve, it creates a new WordLand draft. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I write the first draft of the review and when I'm ready I publish it. The protocol supports revisions, btw.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When the user publishes, in WordLand it builds a URL with tv.bingeworthy.org as the destination. The post body has a JSON object with title and content properties, both of which can contain markdown. The URL params contain the id of the program, screenname of the user, the token that authorizes updating the comment for the rating of this program by this user. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On tv.bingeworthy.org, if the token agrees with the one in the database, it updates the &lt;i&gt;comment&lt;/i&gt; field of the rating, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then tv.bingeworthy.org sends a websocket message to the author, in Bingeworthy, so they can update the display of the rating for the user, if they still have the program displayed on their screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've done these kinds of protocols before, for example, menu sharing on the Mac in the 90s and rssCloud on the web. These are increasingly complicated things, because they require secure coordination between a circle of programs, and allow choice in each of the nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing hard-coded about the protocol only working for this pair of programs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also supports updating. And the post is also available in WordPress and RSS, so even though it's editable in a great editor, and displayed in a collection of similar writing, it is also fully scattered into the wind. And there's no need for federation, it's just a protocol. We don't even rely on the apps using the same identity system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/41&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I started on the WordLand support repo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I spent a few days designing and implementing the protocol that allows WordLand to be the writing tool for Bingeworthy, thus giving it a real writing and publishing function, instead of the usual ridiculous tiny little textbox. Today I'm going to make it work for writing and reading actual reviews for shows I have opinions about. I've always wanted to do this in a way that it's not just scattered into the wind, to rely on Google to find it again. Now I'll be able to scatter it, and also have it maintained in context, where it can help me remember what I liked about a show, and why perhaps I gave it an excellent rating when some parts really sucked. This was something that was missing in Bingeworthy, I knew it -- just didn't know how to make it work. Now I think I have it working." created="Tue, 21 Jan 2025 14:03:47 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/12/10/thisIsNextYear.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/21/140340.html#a140347"/>

It farms the job off to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, which shoots the text back to Bingeworthy as the user publishes to WordPress and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, in Markdown. So the text is on both BW and WP and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse&lt;/a&gt;. And through WordPress it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/industry-was-great-until-the-end/&quot;&gt;presence on the web&lt;/a&gt;. This is the goal, writing exists on its own, but can be shared in all the contexts it makes sense in, but it lives primarily in your blog, your home base. That's why WordPress is so important in the scheme of things. It's a consensus, this is where a lot of people are blogging in 2025. And there's a lot of mostly unexplored interop. And they don't break developers. This may not make total sense at this time, but soon, I hope to be able to point back at this post, and say it was the first time something important worked.</description>

			<description>BTW, actually the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; is probably too big a compromise. The &quot;web&quot; part is the only part that's imho useful. The sad part is that &quot;social&quot; means &quot;we removed most of the features of the web.&quot; Why? Some vague sense that people would write too much if given the space. Or link too much. Or edit too much. Or be too emphatic. It's worse than Disneyfied -- at least at Disneyland you get actors, and color and rides, and bland food with tons of sugar and fat. But there is some fun and nutrition. In the social web, it's just memes and slogans. Not even much room for a metaphor. There's so much more to say about being human.</description>

			<title>Pam McQuesten, dear friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sad news: Longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Pam+McQuesten&quot;&gt;Pam McQuesten&lt;/a&gt; passed away on January 1 after a brief illness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681058035952686/posts/1681610715897418/&quot;&gt;knew Pam&lt;/a&gt; in Silicon Valley, as we were starting up Living Videotext in 1983. Our office was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Elwell+Ct,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94303/@37.4320011,-122.1062105,1048m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fba3f1e2d0db3:0x2fd030af404448b3!8m2!3d37.4320011!4d-122.1036356!16s%2Fg%2F1tgb__w0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;Elwell Court&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto, just off 101, near the golf course and airport. Pam was managing editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)&quot;&gt;BYTE&lt;/a&gt;, the class act of tech pubs in the early personal computer business, then editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Computing&quot;&gt;Popular Computing&lt;/a&gt;, the magazine for the people (ie users of computers). When she was at BYTE, her office was on the same floor as ours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tech industry was rough even then, all the young egos, people who were sure they could do everything, not much collaboration, lots of betrayal. She was one of the few people I could talk with on a personal level, with trust and intelligence. We talked about the future of the technology we were creating, and what we wanted from all this. She was a mentor, like a big sister, best friend, someone I trusted and loved. A very rare friendship. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, her name in the 80s, before her marriage to Paul McQuesten, was Pam Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our paths crossed again a few years ago on Facebook. I invited her to join a private group I have with friends I love and trust, to share the life I had at my &quot;pond house&quot; in the Catskills. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to post a brief remembrance here in case any of Pam's friends are tuned in, so they can be part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681058035952686&quot;&gt;celebration of her life&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/20/pamMcquesten2010.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Pam McQuesten in 2010 via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/nitle/4523727367&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When I put an image in the margin of a post I often pause and think about what I want to convey with the image as it relates to the writing that it's next to. In the previous piece the idea was interop. I tried to think of what images I've used in the past, then I thought why don't I just look. I switched into Daytona, entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I loved, but then kept scanning, and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; that I liked even more. Tools are important. Web writers haven't gotten any new tools in a long time. All the tool development has been for other stuff. Let's make tools for users again, as we did in the olden times. Craftwork in software. Playin in the band!</description>

I started working at UW 28 years ago today as the World Wide Web Editor in the Office of News and Public Affairs. My first project was to implement Userland Frontier for the university news page.&quot; Now Nick is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison&quot;&gt;my Madison story&lt;/a&gt; too. And he mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=UserLand%20Frontier&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. With Frontier, we not only had the internet over networks, we also had networks on our computers because Frontier could send tasks to scriptable apps, and get back results. So databases could be hooked up to page layout programs, and people could use their writing tool of choice, and didn't have to use some teeny little excuse for an editor provided by a company that doesn't cater to or care about writers. Imagine writing with software that was designed to hobble writers instead of glorify them! That's the horror of the world as proposed by Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, all of them. It's like no one stopped to think about what they are doing, half their product is writing, and they suck at writing and have no plans to improve the situation. Geez Louise, it's as if we collectively lost our minds.</description>

Bingeworthy doesn't have a text editor, and it doesn't need one, because when it wants to offer a user a chance to explain their rating, like &quot;seasons 1 and 2 were great, but season 3 sucked, but I gave it a high rating anyway,&quot; they can use WordLand which loves writers and strives to serve them better and better. Why should I put a bullshit editor in a product (Bingeworthy) that isn't about writing. Its job is very different from WordLand's. Let them work together. That's the big idea, that's why you bother having &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, so you can use more than one tool on the same data.</description>

			<description>There's more to the story, but this is already a lot to ask you to digest. I'll get a demo together soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Pretty sure there's no supportable reason to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/01/17/nx-s1-5258396/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban&quot;&gt;ban TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, any more than banning Facebook or Twitter would make sense.</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/28/marshmallowManFromGhostbusters.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've come to the conclusion that you can't really use &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=chatgpt&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; as a programming partner. It doesn't understand the big picture, and if you try to explain it, it probably isn't getting it, and if it does, it will forget it quickly. It's basically fairly stupid, but a way better search engine than Google. Also, it never says it doesn't have enough info to answer the question and then an hour later you figure out the answer it gave you just doesn't work. I still think it's an incredibly useful too, just not as great as I used to think. In a couple of years it has never asked for more information before it answers. That's a clue.</description>
