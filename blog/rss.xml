I don't think it's good or bad, it could work out great. No one knows if this was The Season the Knicks were meant to go to the Finals, but if it was, maybe next year will be too? There's no right answer. Maybe this was Dolan's call. I hope not.</description>

			<description>If you followed the Knicks through the playoffs as I did, I recommend the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/indianas-incredible-finals-run-a-knicks-summer/id1043699613?i=1000710778336&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Bill Simmons podcast. It began with talk about the fan base and that got me thinking. We don't know what would happen if the Knicks were in the Finals. Honestly. It could be the antidote to the crazyness. Maybe the reason things are so fucked up is that it's been 52 freaking years since the Knicks won the title. Something happens every so often, the energy field around the Knicks shifts -- Patrick Ewing, Melo, Linsanity and now Brunson. It'd be interesting to map that out against events in the world at the corresponding times. We won't find out this year. In the same way I sensed that New Orleans was doomed when I went to school there, I have a strong feeling connecting the Knicks to something not sure what, but it feels big.</description>

When you're fitting a product to another &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/155259.html&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; as a platform, it's so important to get help from the vendor, and usually you don't get much of that.

Lots of important ideas in Jay's talk. For example, the idea of developing something from one direction or the other. The problem with Bluesky and Mastodon is that they're coming from Twitter, and think they're aiming toward the web, apparently -- but they must not understand the web, because they're going to have to break with Twitter's model in &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;so many ways&lt;/a&gt; to reach the web, they'll never get there if they go slowly. If you tried to develop the social web by starting with the web, you arrive at a different place, w/o all the problems of twitter-like systems. Different problems, but not the ones the twitter model has. How do I know? Because I know. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I asked ChatGPT if I moved to NYC in 2009 or 2010. It answered in an instant. &quot;You moved to NYC in 2010.&quot; I asked how it knew. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/02/whenIMovedToNYC.png&quot;&gt;used my blog&lt;/a&gt; as the source. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/683da1e2-33d0-8012-a86c-d5310ac4538e&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the future. This is exactly the kind of query I've been begging Google to support for decades. They could have figured out where my blog is, or let me tell it where it is. Famously they once asked if I had misspelled my mother's last name in a query. How freaking clueless can you get.&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/hating-new-york&quot;&gt;Krugman is right&lt;/a&gt;, living in NYC is amazing. When I lived in Manhattan betw 2010 and 2019, I had it great but toward the end I yearned to live in the mountains, the year before Covid hit (that was a bad time to be in Manhattan, btw). Now I yearn to again live in the city. Funny how that works. Even in the 70s I felt safe in NYC, and I commuted to school from Queens to the Bronx. It was safe enough to let a 14 year old kid ride the subway into Manhattan and up to the Bronx and back, every freaking day. I never got mugged. And I did all kinds of dangerous stuff that independent-minded teen agers do. If you can afford it, I recommend you spend some time in NYC before you believe the bullshit the Repubs say about it. They have reasons not to like the cities that have nothing to do with how nice it is. In NYC we don't trust our politicians to tell the truth. You shouldn't trust yours so much either, dear Republicans. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>In honor of the Knicks' very successful season, I temporarily put the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/27/knicksFansWithBagsOverHeads.png&quot;&gt;paper bags fans&lt;/a&gt; at the top of my home page as a reminder to anyone who wants to blame someone on the Knicks for how the season turned out. I think we should all wear the paper bags on our heads as a reminder of how we felt about being Knicks fans &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/game/ind-vs-nyk-0042400301&quot;&gt;not all that long ago&lt;/a&gt;. They are always a horrible team to love, whether they're playing for the title, or just trying desperately not to be the worst team in the NBA this season. Love hurts as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFE2SnliiV0&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; wise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhJyjBVTyxU&quot;&gt;person&lt;/a&gt; once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soDZBW-1P04&quot;&gt;sang&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Suggestion to WordPress devs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Below is a screen shot of a post written by Doc Searls as viewed in Bluesky. It's jarring. The big picture of Doc gets in the way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;//s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/06/02/docInBluesky.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Doc's post as viewed in Bluesky. His picture dominates. Imho it shouldn't.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realize no one designed this, but it also is reality, it's how a lot of people see Doc's writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my suggestion. When the user specifies a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt; for a post, set the og:image element in the head section of the page. When they don't specify such an image, omit that element. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how we did it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/160323.html&quot;&gt;Baseline theme&lt;/a&gt;, and I, as the writer, am happy with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Your butt still stinks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Human beings spend far to much effort feeling better than some people or feeling inferior to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is understandable, I guess, as far as evolution is concerned, up to a point, but I think we've been past that point for a long time now. Now, evolution brought us to a point where in order to survive as a species we have to get over this need to rank people and work together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you feel other people are better than you, get over it. Same thing if you feel better than others. You aren't and they aren't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your shit still stinks and as the great Republican philosopher Joni Ernst so eloquently put it, she's going to be dead pretty darned soon and so will you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to remind myself of this when I see a picture of someone who is really ugly but acts like they're not. And when I say ugly, I mean ugly inside. I say to myself &quot;Davey, they are reflecting off something inside yourself that you don't like. On a different day they might seem very beautiful to you!&quot; So I can relax and stop worrying so much about what I think about them in the moment. It matters not one bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml&quot;&gt;month gone&lt;/a&gt;, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven't had a drink in months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen who isn't as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply &quot;Let's go Mets!&quot; I like that, though it will of course take me some time to get re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-highlight-jalen-josh-explain-why-the-yankees/id1729497779?i=1000710590814&quot;&gt;his podcast&lt;/a&gt; that New York has two teams, the Knicks (I agree) and the Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team without &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change some things over the summer, and I've heard that they might try to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22kevin%20durant%22&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt;. I sure hope not. I think the Knicks are benefiting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/&quot;&gt;the jinx&lt;/a&gt; he put on himself when he tried in vain to stir up a &quot;rivalry&quot; between the Knicks and the Brooklyns. No, that isn't likely to happen, unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the butt like KD did. Maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers&quot;&gt;Portland Trail Blazers&lt;/a&gt; will want him. That's about as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Portland,+OR/@41.7399086,-119.4458701,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6783853!2d45.515232!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; from New York as you can get in the NBA.
