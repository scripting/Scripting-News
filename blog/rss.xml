			<title>An internet of ideas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use one of Twitter's successors.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d&quot;&gt;Here's one&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We should be able to tweet from within any application that has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little text boxes.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d&quot;&gt;And another&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted in there being room for only very simple ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before. Oy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;? I don't want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly what we're talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo. But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such thing. If you're federated that means you peer with your competitors. Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg's company these days, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/&quot;&gt;cut off&lt;/a&gt; an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might also want to hook into flow from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.org/&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;. I never believed in their support of the fediverse. Now let's get some reality into these discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x&quot;&gt;On Unix&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that works like that. I hope I have, to some extent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the tech world. Who could've seen that coming? Not me. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x&quot;&gt;Radical idea&lt;/a&gt;. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.&quot; I don't like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used to say stuff like that about me. It's a substitute for trying to understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned about creating open technology is you attract people who don't contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it's crazy. If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just trust the universe. But giving people orders, there's no place for that. Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent that we can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If you want a clue, listen to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; from January 8, and then if you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316&quot;&gt;ask them here&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd. I also don't believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy&quot;&gt;Tooth Fairy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Glinda&lt;/a&gt; the good witch of the south. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/&quot;&gt;half of the report&lt;/a&gt; on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;enough followers&lt;/a&gt; to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up. It's very hard to get away from companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd. I also don't believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy&quot;&gt;Tooth Fairy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Glinda&lt;/a&gt; the good witch of the south." created="Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:06:01 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/14/131116.html#a130601"/>
				<source:outline text="One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/&quot;&gt;half of the report&lt;/a&gt; on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;enough followers&lt;/a&gt; to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up. It's very hard to get away from companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately." created="Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:07:34 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/14/131116.html#a130734"/>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two very different approaches to the same technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Is Bluesky federated like Masto?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the dialogs you encounter when getting started with Bluesky. It's easy to see how new users might be led believe that Bluesky is federated, as Mastodon is.

			<title>GitHub and chatbots</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We need an AI chatbot that can work with GitHub repos. That is, in my prompt I say, the following questions are about this GitHub repo. At that point it is ready to answer any question about the project. This an incredibly important intersection of capabilities. As far as I can tell, GitHub doesn't offer it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating that people will suggest I use their editor, I don't want to use their freaking editor. This keeps coming up everywhere. You can't use this or that unless you use their editor. Insidious form of lock-in. And it also limits their market to people who use their editor. Shortsighted and stupid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to start thinking about choice. If it applies to developers, it's more likely they will follow through in the designs of their own projects and give their users choice as a matter of principle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to use a chatbot that incorporates the philosophy of the open web. They have opinions btw. One of the first things Claude.ai does when I give it some JavaScript code is that they &quot;modernize&quot; it. That is also insidious. I choose which constructs I use carefully, and follow the rule that one way to do something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bots can be bullies because the companies that make them are tech companies and thus shortcuts to make money, and thus handicap their users. Maybe the users are starting to figure this out. One can hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's all about WordPress, a product that you won't read much about on this blog, going back through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't paying attention until 2023 when I began to see what an amazing product it is, not just for 2004 when it came out, but in 2024. My theory is that it's the basis for an incredible social web platform, much better than Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky and of course Twitter. That's what I'm talking about for 1/2 hour in this podcast. If you give me that much time, I'll change the way you see the world, or at least the way you see me. I think I'm right about this, with another layer on top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of WordPress. The fact that they aren't gives a clue as to how portable your work is there, and how little choice you get in writing tools. Anyway, please make the time to listen. This is pivotal, and I don't think I'll ever be able to spell it out in writing, it's pure storytelling. Thanks!</description>

			<description>Just found an exponential memory leak at the database level in Bingeworthy. I have never seen one of these in all my years of programming. A data structure that saves a copy of itself in itself. So every time it saved it became exponentially bigger. Until it made the SQL server crash because the JSON object it was storying was over the limit of JSON objects. Crashed the freaking server. Fixed. Feels good.</description>

			<description>As part of the conversion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, I started the database from scratch, but before I did that, I exported &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/tree/master/data&quot;&gt;all the data&lt;/a&gt; and put it in a GitHub repo. This included a JSON file of ratings for each user. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/users/davewiner.json&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my file. Remember we used Twitter identity then, &lt;i&gt;davewiner&lt;/i&gt; is my Twitter username, just replace my name with yours to see your file, if you were a Bingeworthy user in the past.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all of a sudden new items started appearing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;the new Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought oh geez there's some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but quickly realized &lt;i&gt;someone was using it&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;it was working. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with first, and I wanted to fix up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/bingeworthy/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, such as they are, but I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the TwitterPocalypse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; is the app I missed the most that hadn't been ported off Twitter identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you're getting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The most important features are there, although they don't necessarily look that great. I want to do some more work there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you have any questions or problems, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on the Mac in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There's a slight typo, but rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to find. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/07/bingeworthyLogoForScriptingNews.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The all-new logo for Bingeworthy, via ChatGPT of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But when I ask ChatGPT &quot;can you do this in MySQL&quot; it gives me one or two ways to do it, but usually just one. These are things I never would have found in the old Google-search way of finding answers.

SQL has been around for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe they went through this stage and emerged from it with a better answer.

Also this is why it is so important to keep the archives of the 1990's web preserved. We may need to loop back to this when the people responsible for the social web decide that interop is important as opposed to each of them going it alone.</description>

Just thinking out loud here. Working with a group of people. It's possible it's just the author and editor, or it could be a larger documentation job, or a report covering a lot of ground. In 2025 we'd use AI to find the threads in our writing, to maintain a book outline that changes as our writing goes forward. Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started. I've yet to use a ChatGPT-like service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for writing this kind of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand. I would write a post about a feature as I thought about it, but not worry about how it fits into the rest of the book. Trust the AI organizer to help us do something sensible.</description>

Developers are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we're working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let's throw some more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism, whatever the source is, it's not a good way to introduce yourself. And, even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error message about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834&quot;&gt;legacy blob&lt;/a&gt; bullshit. They've already done this, and they're just getting started. It's why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying to force us to adapt to them. I'll do it one more time, and then that's it. They can fix my code next time they break it.</description>

There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don't reallllly want us to work with them, or we wouldn't be having this friction. Their API is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; where everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;gets&lt;/a&gt; to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet.</description>

There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; where everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;gets&lt;/a&gt; to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet." created="Sun, 05 Jan 2025 15:46:58 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/05.html#a154658"/>

			<description>BTW, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/01/03.html#a010024&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;, last night's Knicks game was great. Up until the end, when the other guys took over and sadly the Knicks lost. We need a stronger bench. The starting five are great but they're not totally super-human.</description>

			<title>Gambling, sports, kids</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman writes&lt;/a&gt; about social media is poisoning children's minds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like that Krugman has resumed his blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that sometimes I agree or disagree, or have mixed opinions, but I always learn something. That's what makes a blogger good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I agree that children's minds are being poisoned. But I am pretty sure when people like Krugman and myself reach a certain age, and we are the same age, we start looking at new media that way. Maybe &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; minds are poisoned. My father called television the &quot;idiot box.&quot; But it eventually became the literature of my generation, often very good. But maybe laws can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the NFL, MLB and tennis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And is this why they can now afford to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-agrees-to-contract-with-mets&quot;&gt;sign players&lt;/a&gt; to $765 million contracts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're all getting hugely rich, but I believe that they are certainly doing great harm to the new sports fans growing up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a math major and a 50+ year programmer, and I know that if you gamble enough you lose all your money. And as an addiction no gambler ever gets up from the table to enjoy their winnings when they win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in WordLand on New Years Day, saving it for a good moment on Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Little Feed Reader on Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;little feed reader&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lerbu7ugvc2i&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/a&gt; for you to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is how the pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;i&gt;blogroll&lt;/i&gt; category on feedland.social to determine what's posted on Bluesky. When I add or remove feeds from the category, the OPML adjusts dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm running a new Node app that has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/websocket&quot;&gt;websocket&lt;/a&gt; connection to feedland.social. It receives all the new items as they are found from all feeds over the socket. It's feedland.social's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/firehose-api/&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt;. Since I'm currently the only user of that server, it's getting news from the all feeds I follow, not just the ones in the blogroll category. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app checks each new item to see if it's in one of the feeds in the OPML list. If so, it reformats it to fit in a Bluesky post and sends it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;feediverse account&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're subscribed you should see the item, with a link, in your Bluesky timeline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app re-loads the OPML subscription list every minute so any change is quickly reflected.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; you &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/expandedBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog's home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; in getting this running was rate-limiting. I have dealt with this on Twitter and other services, but Bluesky was not, for a while, letting anything through with the error message that we were over the limit. It was suggested that we should cache the accessToken rather get a new one for every message. I did that and cautiously turned the server on again at first with a 5 message per hour self-imposed limit, then gradually increased it to 10 per hour. The latest version only requires that there be at least five minutes between posts, so that means no more than 12 per hour. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lerhvj52pk27&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt; for the initial idea and his support. He saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and asked if it could work in Bluesky. That was the idea. I have always wanted a tight coupling between Bluesky and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; but didn't know how to do it. We may have just skipped a step. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We realllly could use some more formating features in Bluesky messages. This is a really strong use-case imho for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The coolest thing from my point of view is that I already had all the pieces, fully developed, the only thing that remained was to hook them together. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/feediverse/bluesky/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for Little Feed Reader. It's purposely brief, but I have put a link to this post on that page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; and edited a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;complete blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a response to something &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman wrote&lt;/a&gt;, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso&quot;&gt;Marge said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Fargo. &quot;There's more to life than a little money, you know.&quot; It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper&quot;&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.</description>
