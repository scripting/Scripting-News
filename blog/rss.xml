			<title>A test post</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm working on something that requires an endless stream of test posts. Sometimes when I start writing I end up something that should be published. Should I edit it? Nah.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;this shit is hard. when it's done it looks simple. but these pieces must fit together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;that's why it's soooo stupid to throw out all the interop, because it's going to take you forever to recreate it, if you ever can, which you probably can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;this is the lesson that activitypub and atproto are teaching once again. and the people who are dealing with this have probably known it a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;it would be so much faster to use something that already works and is widely supported.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;this is why we used mp3 in rss to make podcasting. we could have said oh shit i don't understand how mp3 works, so let's create one that does only what podcasting needs. only of course it'll turn out that podcasting needs everything that mp3 already does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;accept a win. don't feel compelled to reinvent everything. you'll find out it wasn't as easy as it looked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If he does his job, the pundits and fans say he's slumping (low points). But he's just doing his job. Same thing, flipped around -- when they say Brunson is scoring so many points, he's doing great, like LeBron or Kobe, but actually it's a sign the team is fucked up. Too dependent on one offensive player, the others are just standing around in case he wants to pass it to them. I exaggerate, but it does work out that way. What you want is a team where there are always lots of options, and to the extent that they're hot, the team is impossible to defend. But a Brunson holding the ball all the time makes it easier to beat the Knicks? That was (as I've said a few times) the problem with Melo. Now we've &lt;i&gt;seen&lt;/i&gt; the non-Brunsons on the Knicks kick ass. If the Knicks don't make it past this round, and it is it seems pretty likely -- next season they should focus on configurations that have to sink or swim based on whether they can win without Brunson. Then, next year, we'll have something, perhaps. But I'm just a fan, seriously, no sarcasm. Same way I'm a fan of AI, I have no idea how it works, and I'm happy with that. And don't tell me it's like auto-complete, try using it for a while for real stuff, and tell me how you know that from using it. You don't. Each system has quirks that you have to learn the same way you have to learn the quirks of team members, and help them do stuff they're good at, so they can handle the ball and take shots without you getting involved. That's how you start to get teamwork. See how that works kind of like basketball? :-)</description>

How is it augmenting their work? I know Chris well enough that he probably thinks it's not for him, too technical -- but that's the point -- the excitement with AI is not technical. That's the story all the other reporters are missing. It's the light in the users' eyes when they struggle to make you understand why it's the most incredible thing ever and they're so glad to have lived to see this. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; the freaking story. Help them get the ideas through. BTW, we have no idea how AI will rock our boat, we never did for other similar inventions. Who knew what the Beatles would lead to when they &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1964_North_American_tour&quot;&gt;came to America&lt;/a&gt;. They said (the Beatles did, with ridiculous humility) that they expected their fame will last a few years at most. PCs a few years later were supposed to be for the kitchen. Apple actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/28/appleKitchenComputer.png&quot;&gt;ran ads&lt;/a&gt; saying that in the late 70s. And the web? Well Chris was around near the beginning of that and knows how our eyes glazed over at the utopia we were envisioning, and we know, to some extent how all that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#First_presidency_(2017%E2%80%932021)&quot;&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;. The AI story is a great one, and as Chris had very little understanding of blogs when he did the series of podcasts in 2003 and 2004 that should win the Pulitzer Prize for being so presicent and courageous, he's the right guy to get this story, if he has the patience and stamina. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/05/22/214121.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;. Sure you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to cover Harvard v Trump but AI is a story of love from the users and that story hasn't been told yet, and it's a big one, like what were the Beatles for and why, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1964_North_American_tour&quot;&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I asked ChatGPT to review my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Knicks&quot;&gt;archive on the Knicks&lt;/a&gt; and to summarize my feelings about the team over the years. This is what they said. &quot;Your sentiments toward the New York Knicks over the years appear to be a blend of enduring loyalty, cautious optimism, and occasional frustration. Your writings reflect a deep-rooted connection to the team, celebrating their victories and expressing hope during promising times. At the same time, you don't shy away from critiquing management decisions or expressing disappointment during less successful periods. This combination suggests a passionate fan who remains committed to the Knicks, appreciating their highs and thoughtfully analyzing their lows.&quot;</description>

			<title>Helping Harvard?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should help Harvard, because Harvard helped me, and if you use podcasting or RSS, it helped you too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, I was ready to leave Silicon Valley, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; needed a safe place to be parked, or I felt the tech industry would keep trying to own it, and make it far more complicated than it needed to be. And I wanted the intellectuals of academia to blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I knocked on the door at Harvard, because I heard they had a program that was close to being up my alley -- the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow&quot;&gt;John Perry Barlow&lt;/a&gt; was a founding member. I figured if they could handle a Grateful Dead lyricist, and general muck-raking rabble-rouser like &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Barlow&quot;&gt;Barlow&lt;/a&gt;, they might be able to appreciate someone of my creative caliber. They accepted me, gave me run of the place, defended us when we got in trouble and great things came from it. But I always felt like a bit of a thorn in the side of the great elite Harvard University. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet I really really really appreciate what they did, but I think what I have to offer might not be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they should take advantage of their unique perspective on what's happening in the US, and cover it in a way that no news organization would or could, but the way a great, challenged, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harvard.edu/in-focus/harvard-and-the-american-revolution/&quot;&gt;revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; academic institution would. And it might be that the people who would destroy it don't want to take the risk that Harvard might be heard, and it might be a bit premature for them to think they can take control of an organization that in a sense represents the best of the USA since 1636. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: When Harvard was 140 years old it stood against the King of England in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/harvards-year-of-exile/&quot;&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The Continental Army lived on the Harvard Campus in 1775 and 1776. The precedent for revolution is baked into the soul of Harvard, it seems to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Halliburton Choke</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I never really had any opinion about the Indiana Pacers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Honestly I was surprised they even made the playoffs this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they did catch the Knicks with their pants down, after clearing out the reigning champion Boston Celtics in the second round of the playoffs this year, it took some time before they found their balance again. We learned, again, that we need to have some minutes every game where Brunson takes a long well-deserved rest, so there's room for KAT to lead the team (our other all-star and all-NBA player), and make sure the other Knicks get a chance to shine, and give the Pacers something to guess about. Brunson is great at charging the rim against all odds, but you don't make the Finals if that's the only trick in your quiver. Hopefully we don't have to keep learning that lesson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/26/halliburtonChoke.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Halliburton Choke.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My advice for Halliburton, take a moment and breathe and realize &lt;i&gt;this series isn't over.&lt;/i&gt; The Knicks have a say in it too. And the two teams are remarkably well matched. And despite what the pundits say, there's nothing very special about the Pacers, in fact they have some growing up to do. Halliburton, if they should happen to win another game this year, should learn that either of the first two games in the series could easily have gone the other way. And so should the freaking pundits, when they focus on how great the Pacers were and how pitiful the Knicks are. The Pacers won the first game by three points, and the second one by five. And the Knicks won the third game by six. Could have gone the other way too. And the Knicks are fucking great at overcoming 20-point deficits. The absolute best in the NBA. I have to remember that too, because there was a point in yesterday's game where I gave up. Dave of little faith. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They will call this dance The Halliburton Choke. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/155665636105&quot;&gt;Reggie Miller&lt;/a&gt; made it famous and Halliburton made it ridiculous, and vice versa.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html&quot;&gt;rescinded his lifetime ban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change&quot;&gt;now he can&lt;/a&gt; be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction&quot;&gt;inducted&lt;/a&gt; into the Hall of Fame. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn't I go for it all? I feel so sad that he couldn't have gotten the acceptance he so totally deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws. You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You don't give kids enough credit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will himself to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements&quot;&gt;more hits&lt;/a&gt; than any baseball player ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;//s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/05/25/peteRose.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose&quot;&gt;Pete Rose&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/rosepete000824.html&quot;&gt;Charlie Hustle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he's not and LeBron's game is boring anyway. Let's do this well, win or lose.</description>

			<description>A couple of little tweaks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Hello World&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. It now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/23/historyMenuDaytona.png&quot;&gt;history menu&lt;/a&gt; which it saves in local storage. It's useful to be able to come back to a recent search. It remembers the last 50 searches this way. Also had to add a little hack that turns off other copies of Daytona when another one launches. Use a local storage trick, save a random string to a fixed location, and every second check to see if its value has changed. If it has, another copy of Daytona has launched, so I redirect to the home page of my blog.</description>

And the game seemed so won. When Brunson sat down in the fourth period because he was in foul trouble, the Knicks had a huge run that put them up by 17 with less than 3 minutes remaining. My numbers might be slightly off. Then they brought Brunson back, and it all flipped around. The Pacers were getting off shots where they weren't before, and their aim was deadly. So it wasn't just the Knicks folding, the Pacers were hot. The announcers were so clueless, the Knicks didn't need Brunson back. He was benched a good portion of the final blowout with Boston. I loved that. Showed he can sit down when needed, and the team will keep going. When he was injured in March, the Knicks faltered at first, but then they learned how to put it together with the remaining players which believe it or not are a full NBA team, a very competitive one. So when Brunson gets in foul trouble and the remaining Knicks are in a groove don't screw with it. That should be the lesson of last night's game. The Knicks were very good, net-net, but the Pacers were better and they won.</description>

When he was injured in March, the Knicks faltered at first, but then they learned how to put it together with the remaining players which believe it or not are a full NBA team, a very competitive one. So when Brunson gets in foul trouble and the remaining Knicks are in a groove don't screw with it. That should be the lesson of last night's game. The Knicks were very good, net-net, but the Pacers were better and they won." created="Thu, 22 May 2025 15:51:03 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/05/22.html#a155103"/>

You could tell something was happening. It happened before that with PCs, and now it's happening again with AI. I'm absolutely sure of this, as sure as I was with PCs and the web. So Chris, humor me -- this is your new assignment -- find out from the people who listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; not what's bad about AI, they hear that all the time, let's hear their stories, why they think it's the best thing ever.

The clarity is remarkable, and he's of course right. The people running the validator were actually promoting Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal was &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open web. When you keep changing your mind about what to flag and what to pass you end up with a standard that's as murky as the tariff policy of the US in 2025. I think you have to assume that was the goal. They didn't like that RSS didn't fall apart when Atom came out. If there's no benefit in changing, people don't.</description>

Here's a search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22&quot;&gt;menu sharing&lt;/a&gt; which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.</description>

Hopefully this creates a better more useful archive.</description>

			<description>Apparently Chrome has changed the behavior of images served over http in web pages. It's changing the request to https, so it gives an erroneous error message about the certificate which the page never claimed to have.</description>

But Chrome wouldn't stay out of the way, so had to give up. Hey I was trying to route around their outage.</description>

They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say &quot;no one did anything first&quot; (paraphrasing) and that's basically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html&quot;&gt;same idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I don't doubt that the next big media invention, the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the people developing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This appeared earlier as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E&quot;&gt;grabbing&lt;/a&gt; Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Look at this, for an idea of what a product says to the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes you laugh. When you laugh inside an idea forms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ain't it the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That gets you ready to read the pitch, which is stuff you wouldn't have read or even considered if they hadn't said something so true right up front.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/17/uglyAd.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ugly is only skin-deep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what's wrong with the opposition political party in the US, they think all they need to do is recite the facts. But first you have to convince them you speak from the heart, you'll tell the truth, even if it hurts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's an ugly car. Yeah, but you'll come to love how ugly it is because it's so beautiful inside. What you say next hardly matters, because they already believe that you speak the truth. And that's when they're ready to sign on the dotted line.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what the Republicans do so well, before and after Trump, that the Democrats don't even gets exists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out what the Dems need, the top guy has to be an entrepreneur. Needs to understand how to get people ready to believe the truth. And make the product deliver a truth the people choose.

A few nasty people in the early 00s did a number on RSS and started putting that awful word next to RSS. It was a way of earning points from the people who ran Twitter and tech conferences like SXSW, basically asshole-like people who wanted to close the door on the open web. And now here we are 2.5 decades later and people are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; doing it. You should self-censor on that one, those people are long-gone, probably doing stuff with crypto or nuzzling up to oligarchs, and you're keeping their asshole-ness alive. That's pretty fucked up.</description>

			<description>I wanted to design a Google Form, and thought to ask ChatGPT for instructions from a spec I wrote. Then I thought to ask Gemini, which is Google's chatbot, wondering if they would just do the work for me instead of providing instructions. I would have laughed out loud if they did, but alas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/add0560b6b02&quot;&gt;just instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually they will do that for you.</description>

			<title>About the Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanson has been working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/&quot;&gt;Baseline theme&lt;/a&gt; and it's ready for people to try out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme for WordLand-authored WordPress sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site running in WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the features you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Scott has said he'd be happy to work with others to make it so that it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As the developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way blogs implement various features in 2025. It's been a long time since we took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used, especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging predates both. So of course the &lt;i&gt;presentation&lt;/i&gt; of the blog has opportunities to evolve as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line -- if you already have a WordPress theme you're happy with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you're starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I have it installed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse.org&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm a happy camper. So we have one endorsement. It's a good start. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have comments or questions, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/88&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; to post them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me think I must be dreaming. &lt;i&gt;NYK leads 3-1.&lt;/i&gt; Yesterday at this time (5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and the beginning of last night's game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks couldn't seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It's primitive, but it's real. However! In the second half it turned around. The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by &lt;i&gt;being better&lt;/i&gt; than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must've relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we're up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one, it's over. No I didn't think we'd be here tonight. Remember that when you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as unbelievable as that might be.</description>

I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk?

			<source:outline text="I worked my way through all six seasons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Peaky Blinders&lt;/a&gt;. I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk?
