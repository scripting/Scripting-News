			<title>Thanksgiving gratitude</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Happy belated Thanksgiving. I was so busy yesterday, didn't have the time to do my usual Thanksgiving gratitude post. And I do have a few things to be thankful for this year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First I want to thank all the non-technical peoople who read this blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;every day&lt;/a&gt;. This has been one of the very nicest things about writing this blog, going back to 1994, there have been quite a few people who skim the technical posts, of which there have been many these days, as I am preparing to try to shake up the world of discourse on the net, hoping to get it back on the track it was on before the silos came along and monetized us. Ultimately, if it happens, we will all benefit, techies and non-techies alike. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thank you all for your patience and indulgence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the non-tech readers I hear from are women, btw. My mother for example was a regular reader. For whatever reason, pleasing women is about 1,000,000 times more important to me than pleasing men. Possibly because I had a gutsy mother who programmed me that way. Almost nothing makes me happier.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes me unreasonably happy is to be back in touch with most of the developers who worked with me at UserLand on Frontier. Starting wtih Jake Savin, and then André Radke, Brent Simmons and Wes Felter. And esp with Brent, who went on to write NetNewsWire, the hugely popular feed reader for Mac OS. This means so much to me. I spent years bouncing ideas off Brent and listening to what he said very carefully. I also strived to pass on through each of them my values of software, computer networks, and our responsibilities to users. Each of them are different, have different strengths, but they are all lovely human beings. Reconnecting this year wasn't in any way a goal of mine, it just happened that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes me absolutely optimistic about the future is to discover the compatibility between the vision of the web that I shared with many of the early web developers, again going back to 1994 and the following years, and today's developers of WordPress. We occupy different spaces in tech, I'm a web developer who works in JavaScript in the browser and Node.js, and they work in PHP and their own platform, but as I opined &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/27/145439.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, you can use the web to connect all flavors of things, by design. I used the criticism that Mastodon and WordPress are like &lt;a href=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges&quot;&gt;apples and oranges&lt;/a&gt;, an American idiom that usually connotes incompatibility, but on the web, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; connect apples and oranges. Differences are negotiable, you have to remember that -- and taking advantage of the web that way is what it was created for. Like the internet it was built on, the web makes it possible for very different things to work together, and in doing so makes it possible for &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; to work together too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know I've thanked him before, but it's worth doing again -- thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; for his very timely invention of the web, which set users and developers everywhere free, only to have the siloers re-emerge fourteen years after its advent to give power back to the bankers, with the predictable, disastrous results. Our political system suffered a massive virtual oil spill thanks to Twitter, which we have yet to begin to clean up. As a result health care is in a very precarious state. It has been used as an instrument of war. Who could have imagined that a cutely-named system like Twitter could do all that damage, but it did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;TBL gave us a taste of freedom. Many of the WordPress community leaders are too young to have had that taste, but they still believe in it. And that's probably the most important thing to be thankful for. And maybe it's not the only tech community that has that inspiration at its core. And maybe that feeling extends beyond tech?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We build bubbles to contain us, to make the communities we're part of smaller and thus more manageable. But if we do it right, we can be part of the Macintosh world and the WordPress world, and build the proper interfaces to our work so we're also part of the web. That's where the magic comes from. The unforseen connections that &quot;just work&quot; the first time. That's where I've chosen to work as I approach the end of my career -- on the intersections that route around the silos and return the power of the web to the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, maybe this idea can connect to the story of AOC, Bernie Sanders and Heather Cox Richardson, three of my current-day examples for how we can use communication to get back on track to a world with purpose and a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Connecting apples and oranges on the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a really good &lt;a href=&quot;https://passthejoe.wordpress.com/2025/11/26/dave-winer-is-right-mastodon-is-harder-to-host-than-wordpress/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, in response to a post I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/26/152547.html#a152819&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that said among other things that a WordPress instance is easier to set up on your own server than Mastodon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the piece he said it was like comparing apples and oranges, but by the end, he was starting to see that they kind of do the same thing. I am prepared to explain that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First what they have in common is that they deal with posts, and they have more or less the same features. Mastodon for historic reasons, places limits on posts. I'm sure they could relax those limits, so I don't see this as an important difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then there's all the traffic that comes into a Mastodon instance that doesn't come into a WordPress instance, posts from people you follow, some in response to posts you made. But there is a feed reader built into WordPress. And WordPress supports a very nice API so if you want to build on a different kind of feed management system (as I do) -- no problem, as long as it works on the web, they can connect. Again if we build on the web there are kinds of possibilities that don't exist if you build a monolithic all-in-one system like Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then you might say that feed readers are slow because they poll, and people want to see messages instantly. And this is where I say there's a very well-debugged feature in WordPress that I helped them build in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/blog/2009/11/05/rsscloud-update/&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; that make feed updates instantaneous. Yeah Google tried to FUD it, as they did so much fuckery with feeds, but it it didn't actually accomplish anything. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_Cloud&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; is there, and it works, and it's absolutely instantaneous. Every WordPress site supports it as does FeedLand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I figure if we connect the dots, just building on open stuff (ie the web), with WordPress and FeedLand, hooked up to each other, it would more or less do what Mastodon does. It might still be apples and oranges, but on the web, you probably &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; hook an apple up to an orange and it would probably work the first time. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now there will be things one can do that the other can't, and it probably will go both ways, because this way of doing social networks works somewhat differently, but the cool thing is you can see ActivityPub starting to evolve toward RSS, so I think for the first time in a long time, a very long time, we will see some real motion in Social Media Land. There hasn't been any real competition in this space in a long time, and thus it has stagnated. But with a little competition, the minds should wake up and get to work meeting the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my mottos: &quot;People don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors.&quot; It's still true today as it always has been. We are a species that is motivated to compete. It's deeply ingrained into who we are.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I love posts that pick up from where I started and move the ball in an interesting direction. This was one of the best things about the blogosphere of the past. It's nice to see that tradition being revived. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://passthejoe.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Someone should edit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_Cloud&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; about rssCloud. First they should format the name correctly. Second they say it was superceded by something the W3C did. I asked ChatGPT a straight question, did WebSub supercede rssCloud, and here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/341&quot;&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt;.

It's easy for a Wikipedia page to be hijacked by interested parties, as it was, no doubt, this time. For some reason the AIs seem to factor out the noise, somehow.

			<source:markdown>This is a really good [blog post](https://passthejoe.wordpress.com/2025/11/26/dave-winer-is-right-mastodon-is-harder-to-host-than-wordpress/), in response to a post I wrote [here](http://scripting.com/2025/11/26/152547.html#a152819) that said among other things that a WordPress instance is easier to set up on your own server than Mastodon.&#10;&#10;At the start of the piece he said it was like comparing apples and oranges, but by the end, he was starting to see that they kind of do the same thing.

[rssCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_Cloud) is there, and it works, and it's absolutely instantaneous.

I like that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm doing the same, myself -- only I'm one generation ahead of Matt. So the improvements I'm working on will likely end up benefiting people his age and younger (he's 41) more than people of mine (I'm a boomer).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to leave them the web we had in the 90s and  00s, but doing a lot of the new things we've learned how to do since, without the silos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything built on the web, everything replaceable, choice for users. And all the writing features of the web show through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When this done, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html?title=writersWeb&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt; will be as open as podcasting, something I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;hand&lt;/a&gt; in developing. Any time you want to switch platforms, you can, and lose absolutely nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not &lt;b&gt;de&lt;/b&gt;centralized, it's &lt;b&gt;un&lt;/b&gt;centralized. Important distinction. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The storage system for writing, by default, is WordPress, thanks to their fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpcom&quot;&gt;wpcom&lt;/a&gt; API, which very few people know about apparently. They opened this door in 2017, I didn't discover it until 2023. My chin dropped. All of a sudden storage for writers was openly available through a simple API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/24/141418.html&quot;&gt;of the web&lt;/a&gt;. You're not locked into hosting with any specific company, and you can run your own, and it's a lot easier to install and uses less resources than Mastodon, which right now is the only social networking software you can install on your own server.

I'll tell you about it as it starts to come into view. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to know is that all comments are blog posts. You write the comment on a blog that you own. And maybe that will be the only way anyone other than you will ever see it. But you don't have to &quot;go&quot; to the blog to write the comment. You stay right where you are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A comment is not in any way guaranteed space on the other person's blog. Thus the spam incentive that all other comment systems have is not here. I think that's a huge part of the problem, and it's neatly solved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the people I imagine who will be appearing in my space are the kind of people that used to get quoted on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/mail/default.html&quot;&gt;mail pages&lt;/a&gt;, in the ancient pre-silo web. Doc Searls is #1 on this list, he was a perfect contributor to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mail%20pages%22&quot;&gt;mail pages&lt;/a&gt;.

I think NakedJen will be a fantastic contributor in this mode, and we won't need Facebook to tie us together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See, I already know the people I want to come to the party and the place I want to party. I just have to get the electricity working, the usual things you need, plumbing, heat, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the future if you have a comment on this now relatively long post, you'll click on an icon, write your comment, publish it, with almost no overhead. You won't have to &quot;go&quot; anywhere to do that. It'll be right there where you're reading, just like a twitter-like system. But unlike Twitter commenting, our not-so-tiny &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;full-featured text box&lt;/a&gt; will let you &lt;b&gt;write&lt;/b&gt;, for crying out loud, instead of dealing with a programmer's idea of how you should write. I want all my writing features on my blog, and dammit, when I write a comment too. Why should the comment editor be any different from the regular editor, and why can't all my comments, everywhere, be readable on my blog. See how we're making a web here? It's not hard, you just have to keep factoring. Never stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How many different ways do I have to write? One. Just one.

Only got four responses so far. But it's good to see what people are doing. For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@evanprodromou@evanp.me&quot;&gt;Evan Prodroumou&lt;/a&gt; is using it, and his Mastodon posts are blog posts. I smiled when I saw this.

			<title>Of the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been using the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22of%20the%20web%22&quot;&gt;of the web&lt;/a&gt;, starting in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/17.html#a132112&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote last Monday. Now it's time to explain more about what it means because I used the term in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_Casts&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/24.html#a135150&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For a piece of software, being &lt;i&gt;of the web&lt;/i&gt; means that it is built to share data with other apps, ones that receive data as input, as a feed reader consumes feeds, or generate output for other apps, e.g. software used to publish feeds. Or competitive apps, that do roughly the same thing another app does, and want to be able to receive the user's data, or better, &lt;i&gt;share&lt;/i&gt; the users' data so they can use both apps (we shouldn't settle for less than this, imho). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of the web&lt;/i&gt; means you're signed on to letting users move data wherever it makes sense to them to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days people use the term &quot;web&quot; to mean basically something you can view in a web browser. But that does not mean it is &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; the web. If Bluesky for example were of the web, it would mean you could add a feature to it without rewriting the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This fantastic web is what the silos destroyed, starting with Twitter in 2006. They made the software simpler to use because all the feed reader developers were trying to wall off this part of the web for themselves. Going to WordCamp was invigorating for me, because the people I met there were very much of the web as far as I could tell. And they were young enough to not have been part of the initial web, they've never had the experience of plug and play between apps. I want desperately to develop a small web playground for us to explore all the possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a reason the web is called the web. Visualize what it's capable of doing as a web. It's not just a word, it's concept, a very important one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I looked around the web for illustrations of a spider's web but they're all too orderly too symetric. The point of a web in real life, the kind that spiders make, is they are chaotic and ad hoc. Like the web we make on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Post WordCamp note re BloggerCon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This week I had lunch with a developer who had been at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordcamp&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; last month. He apologized for not being at my session, but I waved it off. I didn't go to many sessions myself, too many great discussions in the hallway, out on the patio or in the coffee room. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remembered this was the rationale for how and why we did &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bloggercon&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-2000s, to bring the hallway conversations into the meeting rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We did this by using a university, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=harvard+%22pound+hall%22+classrooms&quot;&gt;classrooms&lt;/a&gt;, and we put someone in front of the room called a &lt;i&gt;discussion leader. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A good DL should know the topic they're leading and be able to start it off with a provocative intro, 5 or so minutes, and then a microphone, held by a student, is moves to a person with their hand up, and they can speak. Not a question. They have something to say. They are the expert of the moment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The leader can cut them off and move the mike to the next person. (Works even better if there are two roving mikes.) When this works, it really holds everyone's attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This idea came from literally hundreds of hours in boring sessions with a panel of experts and people lined up waiting to speak, in the form of a question of course, and getting nervous and composing a speech in their head, and when its their turn they ramble on and on, so &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; the good stuff happens in the hallway. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is harder to do this kind of conference where the &quot;content&quot; takes care of itself. But the BloggerCon type, when it works is far more dynamic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, the best discussion leaders are teachers and reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I don't eat dog food thank you</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Loving a series I just heard about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/this-is-going-to-hurt/&quot;&gt;This Is Going To Hurt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I discovered it the usual tedious way, scrolling through newly available shows on one of the streaming services with my iPad handy and when I see one that looks interesting, I look it up on Metacritic. If the rating is below 60, I don't look any further, but this show was rated 91, which is a very high rating. It's a British medical drama, the characters and story are fantastic, you can see that right from the beginning. They do show a lot of surgery details, I wish they didn't, I just can't watch that stuff. But I hold the iPad up to block the screen when it gets hard to watch, and I judge from the dialog when the gore is over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I can't stomach are pictures of dog food, esp &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; eating dog food. If you have a similar phobia, episode 4 of Pluribus, which is as usual great, is hard to watch, but the segment where a character eats dog food is self contained. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There also a commercial for dog food that opens with a chunk of the most disgusting dog food, from a company that makes dog food that looks like human food. They're challenging you with a question, would you eat this shit? Well no! -- and I don't want to look at it either dammit. It's why I don't like the term dogfooding, ie people using their own products. As much as I love dogs, the people who use my software are not dogs, and my software is not dog food. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I want to add that I have a vague memory of actually eating dog food when I was a small child with a bunch of equally young friends because we were curious about what it was like. My memory is that it isn't bad. But the memory for me, now as an adult, is nauseating. I like eating human food, even though I'm sure in other contexts it's equally disgusting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But do watch This Is Going To Hurt. Sorry it's only seven episodes, I would have loved it to continue for another few seasons. I have one more episode left to watch, though it totally could have ended after six episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm continuing to work on the way FeedLand detects changes in feed items. This morning I did a careful study of the function that gets a guid for an item in conjunction with ChatGPT. It would be so much easier if RSS 2.0 required an item-level &amp;lt;guid&gt; element, but it doesn't. That was the philosophy, all item-level values are optional. My notes are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDev/issues/11#issuecomment-3563675430&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

When we check a feed, we check each item, if the item already exists, we look at each of the values stored for the item compared with their new values in the feed, and if any have changed, we broadcast the message that the item has changed. I'm doing a complete review of this, based on actual data, and found there were a fair number of places we were calling a change, when nothing that mattered had changed. Now I'm debating whether or not a &lt;i&gt;pubDate&lt;/i&gt; change should be seen as an item change. My initial thought when we were working on RSS, was that the pubDate should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; change. In the real world of publishing I don't think the publication date changes. Right? Of course some feeds do change the pubDate because that's the &lt;i&gt;art of feeds&lt;/i&gt; (sorry for the sarcasm). But I don't think FeedLand should call that a change. Wondering what other feed developers do? So I asked ChatGPT. This is incredibly valuable &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/691f3cff-6998-8012-b505-8734bf11630f&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I learned is that people use &lt;i&gt;atom:updated.&lt;/i&gt; It's true RSS 2.0 has no item that says when an item updated. Anyway net-net, the consensus is that a change in pubDate is not a change. I don't think I'm going to make it immutable though.</description>

Calling attention to an idea that there's a psuedo-human spying on you is bad. Alexa depends on the opposite impression, that it's just a computer. I think AI's should give up the pretense that they're human, and this one should be first.</description>

I sent an email to Matt this morning suggesting that we promote the incredible connection between WordPress and Mastodon via ActivityPub. In the early days of the blogosphere we had the same problem, there was no good way to see who was writing, so we started a site called weblogs.com, which ping'd each site that we knew about to see if it had changed, if so it went to the top of a list that was published at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. So if you wanted to find out what's new you'd just go there. It got more complicated over time, as the blogosphere grew at a very fast clip. We could do that for WordPress sites on ActivityPub by pointing to their site from a weblogs.com-like site. There's no shame in telling the world about the cool new technology you've made, esp when it will make life so much more interesting! But it can't do that if they don't know it's there. Let's do some promotion. :-)</description>

So if you wanted to find out what's new you'd just go there. It got more complicated over time, as the blogosphere grew at a very fast clip. We could do that for WordPress sites on ActivityPub by pointing to their site from a weblogs.com-like site. There's no shame in telling the world about the cool new technology you've made, esp when it will make life so much more interesting! But it can't do that if they don't know it's there. Let's do some promotion. :-)" created="Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:03:06 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/12/23/masto.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/19.html#a140306"/>

			<description>The news gets everything wrong about the nouns of our political system. They talk about Repubs and Dems, but the real power is with the people.  Something that Heather Cox Richardson said so eloquently in this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heather-cox-richardson-people-are-starved-for-facts/id1817225413?i=1000736787935&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Nicolle Wallace. I know I recommended it yesterday, but please do listen to this and don't forget it. When you're watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://ms.now/&quot;&gt;MSNOW&lt;/a&gt; you're getting the wrong nouns. I think this problem could be solved by moving every show on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ms.now/&quot;&gt;MSNOW&lt;/a&gt; to a different American city. The people on the panels should come to work in Detroit, St Louis, Phonenix, Denver, Charleston, Cleveland, Seattle, places like that. Get out of NY and DC. Really connect yourself to the whole country. That would rock a lot of boats.</description>

			<description>I'm preparing FeedLand to reliably do things we haven't had it do yet, at least not at scale. It has one important feature most other feed management systems don't have, dynamic OPML lists that I keep touting here. I have a product that can both generate them and use them on behalf of users. But it's a lot more fun if there are other products that can do the same. It means we can build networks of feed sharing apps, no kidding -- it's going to do new things for us the same way RSS did new things for us 22 years ago. Now it can be fun when there are more FeedLand instances out there. It'd be more fun if they were products like Overcast or Pocket Casts. Sometimes companies like Apple or Microsoft show up in these little projects, it has happened (Apple supported XML-RPC, for example. Microsoft supported Frontier in MSIE on the Mac.).</description>

It seems to work really well. The WordPress site is &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;Daveverse&lt;/a&gt;. And because it's on WordPress it is also available on ActivityPub, at @scripting@daveverse.org, which means you can read it on Mastodon. It doesn't feel weird at all to be reading a blog post on a social network. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3m5rlfrhgec2z&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky that we would love to have the same connection with their social network. It might happen sooner than you think. There are people developing writing tools for ATProto, but they're kind of stuck since Bluesky has all those limits that exclude the &lt;a href=&quot;https://writersweb.org/&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt;. It's so complicated, but out the other end, I hope will come a consensus that the social web should use more of the text features of the web. Further, the distributed nature of the web itself can form the backbone of distribution for the social web, that is if you think &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is part of the web. When it's all said and done, we will realize that TBL got it right when he designed text with titles, subheads, styling, links, editing, no character limits, etc. He probably didn't even have to think about it much, considering he was basically replicating the standard document features from word processing apps of the 70s and 80s, without the printing. That's how evolution works, and the last 19 years of distortion by Twitter and those that followed them, will be seen as a weird transcription error (I hope).</description>

I'll be testing this out and thinking about it now, as we go forward. But here's the milestone: I have a WordPress place to hook into now that has pretty much everything I write outside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;. What I write in WordLand or Drummer, the two places I write for real. The rest of it is throw away nonsense, a waste of time. No one reads anything, everyone fighting for attention.</description>

			<description>I was going to tell you how much I like the Lever podcast, and wanted to recommend it, but they make it impossible to find the RSS url for the feed. The usual hacks don't seem to work. Since I'm subscribed to it on Pocket Casts, I thought I might be able to find the URL on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt;, and it's possible I might have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/podcast/lever-time/0b05d150-ba7d-013a-d90c-0acc26574db2&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it that way. Nope. It just points to the web page for the podcast, which did not have the RSS feed. I know they must have one. I was looking for a way to download my OPML file, would be nice if you could do it from the desktop.</description>

			<description>We ought to be thinking about a filtering system for feed readers based on instructions written by users, and shared on the web, to be parsed by our AI. Design your personal algorithm with an AI engine. Share the good ones with your friends, and have it work on the web, in any feed reader. There are ways to do that. If you're working on such a project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/337&quot;&gt;let's hook it up&lt;/a&gt; to FeedLand. It does a lot of feed reading, and has a nice API for downstream feed readers. It's a good place for an AI-based filter.</description>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2025/11/16/sun-day/&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt;, I have trouble getting into TV series, but not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt;, probably because it came from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilligan&quot;&gt;showrunner&lt;/a&gt; of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, two series that I have watched from beginning to end at least three times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The star of Pluribus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn&quot;&gt;Rhea Seahorn&lt;/a&gt;, was my favorite in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;, as Kim Wexler. So I expected a continuation of those shows, and in some sense Pluribus &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; much like them, but the main character Carol, is nothing like Kim -- who is by far the coolest character in any of the shows, and that's saying a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's okay because the &lt;i&gt;sweetest&lt;/i&gt; character yet in a Vince Gilligan comedy (all these shows are comedies btw, even though the plots are super heavy), is Carol's sidekick, Zosia, played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolina_Wydra&quot;&gt;Karolina Wydra&lt;/a&gt;. She's basically the voice of the Others, but the illusion is so alluring, one character in the show has already (understandably) fallen in love with her. And we know that Carol has formed an attachment too, despite her best efforts to hate her. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, this post is the first one that's cross-posted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/11/16/3096/&quot;&gt;daveverse site&lt;/a&gt;. There still are some things to fix, but this is a nice piece of software. Basically implements what I've been calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22inbound%20rss%22&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS&lt;/a&gt;, not for a social web app, rather for WordPress (which in my mind is becoming more of a social web system every day).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Instead of scattering Stupid Little Text Boxes (SLTBs) all over creation, let’s come up with a nice text router, that means our writing can be in one place, but through the magic of pointers, can appear to be in many places. (Actually there's nothing magical about it, pointers are very basic computer technology, when I learned to program on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture&quot;&gt;PDP-11&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 it very much had pointers.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s mostly a matter of GOST (an acronym for Getting Our Shit Together).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All this is a preamble to say that my comment on your post can be read here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/11/16/3096/&quot;&gt;https://daveverse.org/2025/11/16/3096/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s also on scripting.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See how that works.

We should all think of our AI pseudo-people with as much disdain as Carol has for the &quot;people&quot; who watch over her. They aren't people, in either case. In Pluribus they give you the hint in everything they say. It's not &quot;I think this&quot; it's &lt;i&gt;we.&lt;/i&gt; I'd like my chatbot friends to use similar language. Never behave like a person. That should be as forbidden. We'll regret not controlling this, I think.</description>

It is the web, so anyone can add a feature any time without having to rewrite the whole web. I've been trying ideas out for years, but people preferred silos. Hoping now there are enough people to start a bootstrap. Won't be much of a discourse system if people don't course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
