			<title>Twitter never did links anyway</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/04/debbieDowner.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Today's debate is whether Elon Musk is out to strangle journalism by algorithmically downplaying links somehow. But that isn't what he said. What he actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; is that in Twitter people don't click on links. This is observable. I've known this for years as I tried to arrange it so people could read my blog posts where ever they wanted, and finally in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;gave up&lt;/a&gt; because it was impossible. Even if Twitter had completely dropped the character limit then, it still wouldn't have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why don't people click on links? Probably because the user experience is a nightmare. First you have to turn off your add blocker to even see the article, and then you have to subscribe to the pub to read this one article. So you hit the back button and if you're like me you remember never again to click on links in Twitter. That happened long before Musk arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also what Twitter does is not linking because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can't hot-up some text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can only link to one thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a very limited form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/4818e375-949d-4b7e-9686-4961f148ee32&quot;&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. But not like I do linking in a story like the one you're reading now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best thing one of these services could do to distinguish itself is to support Markdown, allow enclosures for podcasting, have outbound RSS feeds to start, and inbound feeds soon after, and optional titles. That's about it. Basic features of blogging software circa 1999 or so. But they don't want to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one that did so would be loved by writers, and if writers love it, it can't be long before readers love it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the feature that Twitter added in February, while it isn't the panacea that would allow Twitter to let me post my writing there, it is a big step forward. 4000 characters is a pretty useful possible length. And they did exactly what I said they should a decade or so ago with what I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;Fat Tweets&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't want to read the rest, after 280, don't click the freaking button. But when you do, you'll know:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No delay, the text is already there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No request to turn off ad blockers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No paywall.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sounds a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;like podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, you know Adam's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/the-last-yard-adam-curry&quot;&gt;Last Yard&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words you will be able to read what's there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a start. It's better than what was there before. An improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For me it totally justifies the $8 a month fee. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More features like that please.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: And yes Musk's politics are horrible, as are the politics of people who run a lot of companies whose products you use. But Musk's horribleness is in our faces. At some point Tesla and Starlink are going to suffer for it, as Twitter is now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in May 2017 when I decided finally to give up on trying to peer with social networks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In the last few months the net effect of ChatGPT has been an order-of-magnitude improvement to searching the web. This time the innovating could not have been done by a duo like Jobs and Woz working in a garage, or a lone programmer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt;. It required a multi-billion dollar investment, and what amounts to decades of R&amp;D, before any benefit was available. This is an event we will have a much greater appreciation for on the other side, from this side all we can see is how much better it is than what we had before. I've been to this place before. It's the best time to be in tech.</description>

			<description>Just read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblogs.com&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; on weblogs.com. I didn't &quot;decide&quot; to shut down the site in 2004. The management of UserLand at the time transfered the domain to one of my two servers at a local Boston-area hosting service, without telling me they were doing it. It knocked the server off the air. That was what caused the outage. It took a few days to get it back online. The secret -- we converted the site to PHP and it ran much better. No one &lt;i&gt;decided&lt;/i&gt; anything.</description>

Interesting place, new construction but designed to feel like an old time gas station and garage. The food was pretty awful, and the expectations were high because the restaurant is an offshoot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenicia-diner-phoenicia&quot;&gt;Phoenicia Diner&lt;/a&gt;, which is excellent, and always super crowded on weekends. Why was the quality was so different? Something of a puzzle, but you couldn't just walk up to the counter and ask Why does the food here suck given that we were expecting greatness? The great thing about living in this area of clean air, and quiet natural beauty is that the food is so good. Has a lot to do with the artist community, the abundance of music, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culinary_Institute_of_America&quot;&gt;Culinary Institute of America&lt;/a&gt; being just across the river.</description>

			<title>&quot;Open web&quot; is redundant</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've realized that &quot;open web&quot; is redundant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with &quot;indie web&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web is open.

It wasn't meant to be a sweeping statement, or a forever thing. It was over &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/0041fbe8-b00e-478a-88d2-c3427abb6913&quot;&gt;ten years ago&lt;/a&gt;. RSS was hurt by what Google did, anyone who says otherwise isn't dealing well with reality. On the other hand, I've spent the last two years on building &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;new software&lt;/a&gt; for feeds, so obviously I don't feel it's over, actually I think it's is exactly what we need to sew the open social media world together. Small pieces loosely joined. RSS, and formats that came after it, are all about weaving a loosely joined web of blog posts and news articles. If we want it to work, we can make it work.</description>

I'm wondering if when that happened, I shouldn't have stepped up and tried to raise a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; reader from OpenSourceLand. But I don't think it could have happened. It's funny how people processed that event, I didn't see any anger at Google, which if my little old &lt;a href=&quot;http://userland.com/&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; had done something like that, there would have been a huge shitstorm. I think they manage their PR well because there's no one identifiable as the personality of Google, neither of the founders are visible. They don't tweet, you never hear anything about them outside of the business press. Same with the two people they've hired as CEO. Anyway, they treated RSS like an unwanted litter of kittens, put in a shopping bag and dropped from a bridge over a river. No thought to cleaning up the mess they created. They treated their users and the standard they took over like crap. But people need a &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; to be angry with. I'm much less consequential from a business standpoint, or user-control for that matter, my products get ignored mostly, but I am outspoken. And this makes me easy to be angry with. Anyway, I didn't step up because 1. I didn't think anything would come of it and 2. I didn't want to get embroiled in all the anger again. The last time it had nearly killed me.</description>

			<title>An old time MORE ad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Algernon found this MORE ad from the 80s and sent it along.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had been looking for it a few years ago, now I want to be sure next time, it'll be easy to find. Steve used to work at Living Videotext, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/117+Easy+St,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.3924404,-122.067555,122m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fb73b44beac6f:0x75582b6a9e573bd9!8m2!3d37.3923338!4d-122.0674987!16s%2Fg%2F11b8v422sp?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; this product was made. He went on to Apple, where he did system software. He was the one who got XML-RPC and RSS into the Mac OS in the early web days. &lt;i&gt;Thanks Steve&lt;/i&gt; for all of it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/01/moreAdThreeQuestionsTwoAnswers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&quot;He's got three questions. You have two answers. You need MORE.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Steve also sent along an &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/microtimesvolume00bamp_17/page/n49/mode/2up?view=theater&quot;&gt;article from 1985&lt;/a&gt; about me with my standard schpiel back in those days about how outliners came to be. The picture is funny, I was much younger of course, and my expression in the photo was as bewildered as often is. Oh yeah and I was wearing a suit and tie as people often did in business in those days. These days, it looks really funny. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
