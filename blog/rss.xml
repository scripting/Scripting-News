I think it was set up that way so you'd get the point that you're the one who has to hold him to his oath. Now if you won't do it, step aside, and you all keep stepping aside until someone has the guts to stand up for the country and its Constitution. Tell the Repubs to nominate someone else because this dude broke his oath and as the 14th Amendment says so freaking clearly, &lt;i&gt;he can't serve again.&lt;/i&gt; How does it make sense to give him the same oath again when he violated it in such a craven way last time. If we as a country can't come together for this, then we don't deserve to survive.</description>

			<description>If you have a new trend in tech, the absolute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/&quot;&gt;worst way&lt;/a&gt; to promote it is as a replacement for existing layers of tech with huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installed_base#:~:text=Installed%20base%20of%20a%20product,a%20particular%20product%20or%20technology.&quot;&gt;installed bases&lt;/a&gt;. You can't win that kind of comparison. Installed bases generally don't disappear, and if they do, it happens very slowly. You almost certainly don't have the replacement, but you might have a useful product that would appeal to people, so be smart and explain it that way, if you just happen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/2ba3a8fb-8951-4c23-b955-b32199f3ebe6&quot;&gt;boil the ocean&lt;/a&gt; with it, you can thank your luck because that's what actually happened.</description>

			<description>In other words you can't just wish something like the web into existence, you can't plan it, or architect it or envision it. It happens on its own. Look at all the time and energy TBL put into reinventing the web. Never happened, and he's the guy who got the web started in the first place. I've been there when something small became huge and real, twice actually. But I couldn't tell you why, I just have theories. I called it &quot;media hacking&quot; at the time. Create a new media type and put it out there to see if it would stick. After a while nothing would stick because the pipes were controlled by Twitter, Google and Facebook and they weren't sharing. Now we're kind of letting Facebook own the pipes Twitter used to own. Maybe. So many people appear to be fooled into thinking FB is doing something open. They should learn the rules of tech, it's nowhere near as complicated as football or basketball. If everyone wants to interop with one company, nothing open can come out of that. Threads became the thing people wanted to interop with a couple of days after it came into existence. Now it must be orders of magnitude greater than Mastodon, and it's not going to hit any scaling walls because they've already scaled it, in every way. There's still time, I think, for new ideas, but maybe not much time. We'll see.</description>

If we wanted to listen to a specific album we'd have to buy a copy of the vinyl record at a music store. I used to go to a store called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themushroomnola.com/&quot;&gt;Mushroom Too&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zimpel+St+%26+Broadway+St,+New+Orleans,+LA+70118/@29.941399,-90.1285116,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8620a51059b4faf3:0xdf6e23353b2d059d!8m2!3d29.9413944!4d-90.1236461!16s%2Fg%2F11h9w_9m9_?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;Broadway and Zimpel&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans. It was kind of like a head shop, smelled of incense, and they had a great sound system and they were always playing good music. It was on the second floor above a bar called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebootnola.com/About.html&quot;&gt;The Boot&lt;/a&gt; that had the usual college stuff, beer, burgers, pinball. The record store had rows of racks of albums, like a library in a way, and you'd wander around looking for bands you knew or had heard about, and you'd stare at album covers, front and back and try to decide. Looking for &quot;something good to listen to.&quot; And you could only afford a certain number every year, so you listened to each album a lot. I don't know if it works that way for young folk today. In 50 years when you're looking back will you know the songs in the order they appeared on the album? I never bought singles, by the time I came along &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock&quot;&gt;album rock&lt;/a&gt; was the thing, stations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#WNEW-FM&quot;&gt;WNEW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPLJ#Album_rock_era_(1971%E2%80%931983)&quot;&gt;WPLJ&lt;/a&gt; in New York. I'd listen to the student station at Tulane, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wtulneworleans.com/&quot;&gt;WTUL&lt;/a&gt;. They'd play longer songs, and not always the most popular song on an album. You got the sense that the DJ was being creative with the songs they chose.

			<description>Later, when I was a grad student in Madison, I lived in a house with nine roommates. We shared lots of stuff, including our record collections and all of a sudden new music worlds opened to me, including (memorably) Bonnie Raitt, Little Feat, Talking Heads and Saturday Night Fever (which I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oALKAh_bL5g&quot;&gt;listening to&lt;/a&gt; as I write this).</description>

			<title>Jury duty is self-government</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Jury duty is an intensive bootcamp for American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about jury duty is you get a very clear sense of what self-government is about. It makes you feel empowered which can be even more uncomfortable than feeling powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much of the frenetic activity online is about that sense of powerlessness. So we give money to causes or we join in boycotts, but these aren't as powerful as participating in governing. Jury duty is a very quick way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to act more like citizens and less like subjects. I think that's the real message of the election of 2016. Subjects elect someone like Trump. People who think like citizens would elect someone very different.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0522gNDxHBUGssi5VFE2oLZeVkv4eYbRN7JtwkKAHcCM51CBAGFctyMHAs4Wrkgqpl&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2017. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I went skiing today at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain&quot;&gt;Belleayre&lt;/a&gt;. First time in five years. It was great. I've been working out to get ready for it, and was concerned maybe I'm finally too old, but it's good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if you can. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belleayre.com/mountain/trail-map-and-mountain-stats/&quot;&gt;trail map&lt;/a&gt; and some stats on the area.</description>

			<source:outline text="I went skiing today at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain&quot;&gt;Belleayre&lt;/a&gt;. First time in five years. It was great. I've been working out to get ready for it, and was concerned maybe I'm finally too old, but it's good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if you can. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belleayre.com/mountain/trail-map-and-mountain-stats/&quot;&gt;trail map&lt;/a&gt; and some stats on the area." created="Wed, 07 Feb 2024 20:16:16 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/07.html#a201616"/>

			<description>Social networks and RSS. We really should be on the case for all social media networks to support RSS feeds outbound at least (inbound nice too). And also add features to make interop really useful. I've enumerated them &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am making software that builds on this feature in social networks. And yes we do have some examples of that, thinking of WordPress and competitors. I think they are perfectly good bases for social networks.</description>

			<description>I'm doing some writing about writing and finding the phrase &quot;RSS, Atom and RFD&quot; too cumbersome. Most people don't care and see the distinctions as unnecessary. But I want to be accurate, and recognize that while RSS is the most-used kind of feed, there are others, and our software works with them. I'm trying this construction: &quot;RSS-compatible.&quot; I think that expresses the most important point, the choice of format is up to you, but now, by 2024, they all work pretty much the same way.</description>

			<description>If you're creating something new, definitely create it on feedland.com. If you're already using feedland.org, for now you're welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving useful to have around, so I don't imagine it'll go away, it's much easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based server.</description>

			<description>BTW, while we're doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a combination of software that suddenly aren't getting along with each other. Obviously something changed. I'm running it in a somewhat crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of the downsides of having fun with server software.</description>

			<description>One of the cool things about being a programmer is that you can decide to run code that you know has zero chance of working. &quot;Let all hell break loose,&quot; a programmer can be heard to say quietly before clicking the Run button.

			<description>People are really gushing about the Apple goggles, now that they have them in their hands. I still can't get psyched about it. I was late to getting an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/10/1175.html&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and now I &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/03/appleWatch2024.png&quot;&gt;wear it&lt;/a&gt; every day, can't imagine not wearing it. So maybe I will get one eventually. But my vision is weak, and I kind of doubt it'll work for me. And I would much prefer if Apple had poured their vast resources and creativity into making mass transport work in the Bay Area instead, as a prototype for what might be possible in the rest of the world. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; I would cheer, unconditionally.</description>

			<title>Too late for LeBron in NY</title>

If they did that, I don't think I could ever see myself as a Knicks fan again. It would be the most serious form of betrayal, and would show that the management has no freaking clue about NY basketball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We don't mind that the Knicks haven't won a championship since 1973. Obviously we don't mind, or we would not have suffered through all the bozo-osity of the owner and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson#New_York_Knicks_(2014%E2%80%932017)&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; he hires. We love this team, and we especially love the 2024 version of the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last trade was the best ever, even though we had to say goodbye to Quickley, knowing he never really got a chance to shine in NY. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;LBJ&lt;/a&gt; on the Knicks in 2024 would be a terrible fit. About ten times worse the KD on the Nets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2024/02/vision-pro-first-impressions/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2024/02/rowing-to-alcatraz/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; last night. I asked friends at Automattic if it's my imagination or is Matt blogging a lot more now than he used to and they say yes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Matt is a good writer, it turns out. I read his posts as he dealt with the Tumblr situation, which was evolving quickly in real time at the end of last year. You can tell he's done a lot of this, relating to users and developers. I was going to say I've never led a community as large as his, but that's not exactly true. In general people don't treat you very well if you're at the top of something large, esp if they don't pay anything for it, it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Watching him deal with it has made me question the idea of me making software for other people. There was a brief period between 2017 and 2021 that I only made software for myself, and I liked that a lot, but it has the downside that the ideas have little chance of surviving to influence others. So as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; approached, I convinced myself to try one more time. Now this morning, in the middle of a pretty huge transition for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, that's been going slowly and confusingly, and is far from done, I realize that such a major upheaval in an already-deployed server-based product, is really asking for trouble. I feel it in my digestive system, as I used to when I was a kid and internalized all the stress from home life. I'm feeling that stress in a way I haven't felt in a long time. So I think this is the last time I do this. My next product will be a writer's tool and will largely run on the user's machine, and have a small server component, by design, with software that's been well burned-in. I'm not worried about that. And it's okay, because I really think this is the last big corner-turn that FeedLand will need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I probably should write a post explaining what this change is about, or at least record a podcast. If you want to see the details, it's all there in the narrated work &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/56&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. And I will continue to post there until the transition is complete. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning, while I'm waiting for the last query to run, I'm looking through the old sites on the other server (mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/02.html#a162816&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;) and have been looking through various archives I'm carrying with me, including the book my father wrote called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbatoolbox.org/&quot;&gt;MBA Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;. It's a responsibility I feel, and I often think I should modernize the site. It's got the look of a Manila site from the late 90s or early 00s. But it doesn't look all that bad, and he did all the work himself, so this is the way he wanted it to look. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I noted from his Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that Matt was born 15 days before the Mac was announced, an event we celebrated the 40th anniversary of last month, which adds up because Matt celebrated his 40th birthday a few days before all that. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: It turns out we were closer than I thought when I wrote this piece this morning. By noon, the server was updated, the software had been modified to work with the new database schema, and it re-opened to users. What I thought initially would take a few hours took 1.5 days. Once the corner was turned, I took a nap, watched some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman&quot;&gt;Bojack Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, am going to do a Peloton and then watch the Knicks, and I'm starting to feel human again. Whew. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The work is narrated in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/56&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what the snag was. We were low on storage starting at the beginning and eventually we ran out of space, and the error messages we got indicated the problem was something else. All the searching we did, none of the hits, or ChatGPT suggested looking at memory usage. Quite independently after thrashing around trying various theories, we finally got a message from the Digital Ocean service saying the server was out of space. When I doubled the space, that gave it enough room to do the tasks we had for it. Now running the last query. Looks like we may be over the hump. Let's just pray the software runs when we turn the server back on. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

But &lt;a href=&quot;http://outline.land/treefun&quot;&gt;outline.land/treefun&lt;/a&gt; was large and interesting, so I thought I'd put a link here.

			<title>Cats are people too!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cats are on the march in NYC, on 8th Ave between 57th and 45th streets. Thousands of cats carrying signs and handing out leaflets saying 'Cats are people too!' and 'Up with Cats!' -- they are angry but there's a sense of celebration in the march, that finally the time has come for cats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first version had one of the themes as &quot;Down with Dogs!&quot; but ChatGPT rejected that as not being nice enough. So I changed it to &quot;Up with Cats!&quot; Please keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/02/catsRUs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Cats are marching on 8th Ave&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A bunch of new networks are forming, and they will melt into one, following a pattern established by the internet itself, when they formed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&quot;&gt;net of nets&lt;/a&gt; based on a common protocol called TCP. On top of that HTTP was built, with a number of years following with very productive building and bootstrapping, and from there it was a lot of chaos, around the advent of Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader. The last time we had a common way of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; was 17 years ago. I think/hope we're incentivized to make one edit box suffice, in place of the 5-10 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14.html#a145854&quot;&gt;tiny little textboxes&lt;/a&gt; we now all have to copy-paste between, and btw one way of addressing nodes, and then we can start building again as we did last in the 90s and 00s. I see something brilliant in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057231/iconfactory-kickstarter-internet-reader-project-tapestry-twitterrific&quot;&gt;new path&lt;/a&gt; that Twitteriffic wants to go down (I gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; $128). It's same path I've been going down, mostly without partners, for the 17 years since we crawled on land and started tweeting. I don't see the negative shit that's happening on Twitter, it's easy to avoid the mess -- I don't think that's the reason we're breaking out of that silo -- it's that all at once all the devs who had been quietly suffering with Twitter were set free. Boom. All at once. And it turns out perhaps we don't give up so easily. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Bard does pics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Google's Bard now does pictures. I asked for thousands of cats marching on 8th Ave in NYC between 57th St and 45th St. A very different style from what ChatGPT would have drawn and I like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/catsOnEighth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Cats on 8th Ave.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What's up at Harvard?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this note to Chris Lydon re the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/&quot;&gt;latest episode&lt;/a&gt; of his podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chris,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm listening to your latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/&quot;&gt;podcast about Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, and totally appreciate this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In my two years at Harvard in the 00s, I never:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. Experienced antisemitism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. Saw antisemitism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;3. Even thought about the &lt;i&gt;possibility&lt;/i&gt; of antisemitism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the Harvard campus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That said, antisemitism is everywhere, even inside me, a man whose grandparents were Jews who fled for their lives with their children from the Holocaust before and during WWII. I am a product of that, in ways I didn't even realize until my parents were gone. It's everywhere, all around, inside myself, inside everyone, and the best we can hope for imho is that it will stay hidden. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ask me about what happened in the NBA with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kyrie&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/a&gt;, and how, by their silence, the players and coaches showed how huge and deep the problem is.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To see the Repubs monetize this for political gain is par for the course. To see Harvard buckle under that, is weak and the people who made that decision imho should resign in disgrace. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for your continued and unique excellence. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
