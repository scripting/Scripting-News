			<description>Yesterday I posted the ChatGPT &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/16/174119.html&quot;&gt;explainer&lt;/a&gt; for blogrolls, but realized later there was an important use of blogrolls it didn't mention. I kept a blogroll on my home page because those were the sites I wanted to check regularly to see what's new. So I was thinking about my own use of my blog, not just helping out sites I support or giving ideas to people who read my blog. Also they didn't provide an illustration of what a blogroll looks like. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815061940/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; from August 2000, and sure enough, in the left margin, there's the blogroll. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/17/blogrollScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Beatles</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My #1 Beatles song these days is Day Tripper. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of my listening has been to John Lennon, and more reading.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of his lyrics intentionally mean nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My current infatuation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimme_Some_Truth&quot;&gt;Gimme Some Truth&lt;/a&gt; from Imagine is pretty great because the lyrics are super clear, and quite forceful and beautiful. Of course we want the truth, some of us at least, and you can't tiptoe around that. Most people have arranged their lives so they avoid the truth at all costs. In the end the truth prevails for everyone no matter how hard you try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a quick interview with Ringo and Paul, current day, and Ringo is being kind of a bitch saying that Paul was a workaholic, and he's standing right there, but he isn't disagreeing in fact he's nodding his head, basically saying he likes to do things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always wish as a child of their breakup that they had found a way to work together, and for John and George to have their independence from Paul. He definitely took the brunt, but it looks to me like he was desperate to keep the Beatles from breaking up and that brought out his powerful control freak side.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thing is to people my age, these were our uncles. But maybe there was nothing after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12R4FzIhdoQ&quot;&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;? Maybe they really were done. We like to believe there was more, but maybe there wasn't.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course the people who were Beatles were just people, strangers to us really, we were just projecting our dreams on them. Until the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; show, which answered so many of our questions were answered and got us thinking and dreaming again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson&quot;&gt;Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt; changed the world of 20s as much imho as the Beatles did in the 60s. He did a great thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Journalism isn't responsible</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There is no organized oversight of journalism. No one whose criticism they respect. And they don't criticize themselves. It's a monopoly, with no reason to change, and that's a formula for a festering mess. Their sense of entitlement is legendary. Such chutzpah. Until it shakes up, we're going to keep getting Trump-size debacles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They could easily blame their employers for creating Trump. If it weren't for his reality show would his followers see him as anything other than a pathetic East Coast blowhard with a bad combover. Instead they blamed Facebook. Not that FB didn't profit enormously from Trump, but you just can't see the role journalism plays because they can't bite the hand that feeds them. But we can. I don't owe them anything, do you?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW it would be incredible to see an investigative report of how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5tbx4y/where_did_the_but_her_emails_image_meme_come_from/&quot;&gt;But Her Emails&lt;/a&gt; meme was birthed? What does it say about cynicism about the press. Did any journalists hear it? Do any of them feel it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/17/butHerEmails.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We feel this.

			<title>What is a blogroll?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/972ad854-8975-4397-9bff-9b03af9e7577&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A blogroll is a list of links to other blogs or websites that a blogger enjoys or finds relevant. It's often found in the sidebar of a blog. The purpose of a blogroll is to share recommendations with readers and to connect with the broader blogging community. By including a blogroll, a blogger can provide their audience with access to additional resources, opinions, or communities that share similar interests. It can also serve as a tool for networking and building relationships with other bloggers, through mutual linking or acknowledgment. Blogrolls were more prominent in the early days of blogging but can still be found on many sites today.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't improve on that, so I published it as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Skiing is falling</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went skiing again today, second time in two weeks. Feeling pretty good. And I learned something I'd like to share. A different way of looking at skiing. Here's the story...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First thing in the morning the snow was hard and while they had done a good job of grooming, you do a lot of sliding when you edge when the snow is so hard. Much more than in the powder you get in the Rockies. So I'm always totally thinking about staying in control and it's stressful. In this mode I ask myself why I'm doing this if it's so unpleasant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as the snow softened during the day, and my body warmed up, and my brain remembered more about this strange thing that I used to do so well, I started going faster, not worrying as much, and then started going faster, and I started feeling like wow I'm doing this well, and then boom, for an instant I completely lost control and was tilted one way, but had to land the other way, and without any conscious thought and absolutely no time to worry, my brain and body did exactly what you have to do to make this look and feel super elegant, almost as if I must have planned it this way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I kept skiing a bit after that and then stopped and breathed the cold air, and looked at another ski area far in the distance (Hunter?) and realized something -- skiing is falling. You go to a mountain top, pull down your goggles, get to the top of some steepness, and you jump. The question is -- do you look and feel beautiful while doing it, or are you scared and trying to stay in control. But that's the thing, falling is all about letting it go and trusting your mind and body will know what to do when you fall one way, and also when you fall another. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I went skiing again today, second time in two weeks. Feeling pretty good. And I learned something I'd like to share. A different way of looking at skiing. Here's the story..." created="Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:31:32 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/15.html#a193132"/>
				<source:outline text="First thing in the morning the snow was hard and while they had done a good job of grooming, you do a lot of sliding when you edge when the snow is so hard. Much more than in the powder you get in the Rockies. So I'm always totally thinking about staying in control and it's stressful. In this mode I ask myself why I'm doing this if it's so unpleasant." created="Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:44:01 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/15.html#a194401"/>
				<source:outline text="But as the snow softened during the day, and my body warmed up, and my brain remembered more about this strange thing that I used to do so well, I started going faster, not worrying as much, and then started going faster, and I started feeling like wow I'm doing this well, and then boom, for an instant I completely lost control and was tilted one way, but had to land the other way, and without any conscious thought and absolutely no time to worry, my brain and body did exactly what you have to do to make this look and feel super elegant, almost as if I must have planned it this way." created="Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:44:26 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/15.html#a194426"/>
				<source:outline text="I kept skiing a bit after that and then stopped and breathed the cold air, and looked at another ski area far in the distance (Hunter?) and realized something -- skiing is falling. You go to a mountain top, pull down your goggles, get to the top of some steepness, and you jump. The question is -- do you look and feel beautiful while doing it, or are you scared and trying to stay in control. But that's the thing, falling is all about letting it go and trusting your mind and body will know what to do when you fall one way, and also when you fall another." created="Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:44:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/15.html#a194451"/>

I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/13.html#a214721&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he has great-grandchildren he'd like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I'm trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It's prudent, and has a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I'd just like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn't curious. No ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it's always interesting to see where people react to what among the different social web networks. And in this case, the most flow came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/111926409460785756&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, by far. I would not have predicted that. And it's good to see, that interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the networks operated by the billionaire tech companies.</description>

I wish he would get over how he looks, all of us have aged in the time since he was last on the Daily Show. It was really good. He finally is back with the writers he belongs with, and this show obviously agrees with him, and I got the feeling I always used to get from his show &quot;we'll figure this out.&quot;</description>

			<description>This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know us before we die. Okay if it can't be other people, at least let it be a machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn't it be great to know that when you're gone, the essential you, even if it doesn't include your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a website. This is just evolutionary, and it's obviously going to happen.</description>

			<description>Today would be the perfect day to ski at Belleayre or Hunter, if you can get out of NYC where all the snow is falling. I have work to do and was planning on skiing tomorrow, expecting 8 inches of fresh snow. We're not getting much from this storm in the Catskills, NYC is getting the brunt. And any day you can't get here from the city means not many people on the mountain. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I didn't like all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.</description>

			<title>One way is always better than two</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I guess) said something personal and ugly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder why after all this time we can't see how pointless it is to have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed through someone else's filters, so you're getting a huge dose of their personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they're talking about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And don't forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;obstacle&lt;/a&gt; in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to interop without the cost of interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always trying to compromise. It's not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed, but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same format, RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and 2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in the steady stream of announcements in the archive of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires two, one person can't collaborate on their own. I know that sounds ridiculous, but sometimes people don't look for the other party who made compromise possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think even the people who were closest to it at the time understood the move. And I don't think very many appreciate the power that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet project to attain unity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One way of doing something is always better than two. That's just a restatement of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.&quot;&gt;Postel's Postulate&lt;/a&gt;. Be conservative in what you send. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively. Every time you add something that already exists we're all going to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think that saying this makes me &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous&quot;&gt;cantankerous&lt;/a&gt; -- well, I say okay -- but you're wrong because it's generous and brilliant to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don't like to hear they're doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that. Complexity is a force against interop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create something greater than anything any one of us can create. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: the role of &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; in design.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trump is treated by Big News the way they cover climate change, with a big shrug, what can we do. Meanwhile, they get all twisted up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Her Emails&lt;/a&gt; and the like.</description>

			<title>A WordPress namespace?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking out loud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting if every feed for a wordpress.com site included the &lt;i&gt;site_ID&lt;/i&gt; of the site an item came from, and if every item had the &lt;i&gt;ID&lt;/i&gt; of the item it came from. Shorten the distance from seeing something that needs editing to actually being able to edit it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was one of the big realizations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A WordPress-aware reader might be able to do something with this. Or if it knew that the user owned the site it came from, it could open it in a simple editor. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking through a use-case and came across this idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Isn't it time for there to be a WordPress namespace? After all it's not only a big part of the web, it's also a big part of the feed world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you have a new trend in tech, the absolute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/&quot;&gt;worst way&lt;/a&gt; to promote it is as a replacement for existing layers of tech with huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installed_base#:~:text=Installed%20base%20of%20a%20product,a%20particular%20product%20or%20technology.&quot;&gt;installed bases&lt;/a&gt;. You can't win that kind of comparison. Installed bases generally don't disappear, and if they do, it happens very slowly. You almost certainly don't have the replacement, but you might have a useful product that would appeal to people, so be smart and explain it that way, if you just happen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/2ba3a8fb-8951-4c23-b955-b32199f3ebe6&quot;&gt;boil the ocean&lt;/a&gt; with it, you can thank your luck because that's what actually happened.</description>

			<description>In other words you can't just wish something like the web into existence, you can't plan it, or architect it or envision it. It happens on its own. Look at all the time and energy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt; put into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web&quot;&gt;reinventing&lt;/a&gt; the web. Never happened, and he's the guy who got the web started in the first place. I've been there when something small became huge and real, twice actually. But I couldn't tell you why, I just have theories. I called it &quot;media hacking&quot; at the time. Create a new media type and put it out there to see if it would stick. After a while nothing would stick because the pipes were controlled by Twitter, Google and Facebook and they weren't sharing. Now we're kind of letting Facebook own the pipes Twitter used to own. Maybe. So many people appear to be fooled into thinking FB is doing something open. They should learn the rules of tech, it's nowhere near as complicated as football or basketball. If everyone wants to interop with one company, nothing open can come out of that. Threads became the thing people wanted to interop with a couple of days after it came into existence. Now it must be orders of magnitude greater than Mastodon, and it's not going to hit any scaling walls because they've already scaled it, in every way. There's still time, I think, for new ideas, but maybe not much time. We'll see.</description>

It was kind of like a head shop, smelled of incense, and they had a great sound system and they were always playing good music. It was on the second floor above a bar called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebootnola.com/About.html&quot;&gt;The Boot&lt;/a&gt; that had the usual college stuff, beer, burgers, pinball. The record store had rows of racks of albums, like a library in a way, and you'd wander around looking for bands you knew or had heard about, and you'd stare at album covers, front and back and try to decide. Looking for &quot;something good to listen to.&quot; And you could only afford a certain number every year, so you listened to each album a lot. I don't know if it works that way for young folk today. In 50 years when you're looking back will you know the songs in the order they appeared on the album? I never bought singles, by the time I came along &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock&quot;&gt;album rock&lt;/a&gt; was the thing, stations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#WNEW-FM&quot;&gt;WNEW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPLJ#Album_rock_era_(1971%E2%80%931983)&quot;&gt;WPLJ&lt;/a&gt; in New York. I'd listen to the student station at Tulane, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wtulneworleans.com/&quot;&gt;WTUL&lt;/a&gt;. They'd play longer songs, and not always the most popular song on an album. You got the sense that the DJ was being creative with the songs they chose.

			<description>Later, when I was a grad student in Madison, I lived in a house with nine roommates.

			<title>Jury duty is self-government</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Jury duty is an intensive bootcamp for American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about jury duty is you get a very clear sense of what self-government is about. It makes you feel empowered which can be even more uncomfortable than feeling powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much of the frenetic activity online is about that sense of powerlessness. So we give money to causes or we join in boycotts, but these aren't as powerful as participating in governing. Jury duty is a very quick way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to act more like citizens and less like subjects. I think that's the real message of the election of 2016. Subjects elect someone like Trump. People who think like citizens would elect someone very different.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0522gNDxHBUGssi5VFE2oLZeVkv4eYbRN7JtwkKAHcCM51CBAGFctyMHAs4Wrkgqpl&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2017. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I went skiing today at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain&quot;&gt;Belleayre&lt;/a&gt;. First time in five years. It was great. I've been working out to get ready for it, and was concerned maybe I'm finally too old, but it's good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if you can. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belleayre.com/mountain/trail-map-and-mountain-stats/&quot;&gt;trail map&lt;/a&gt; and some stats on the area.</description>

			<description>Social networks and RSS. We really should be on the case for all social media networks to support RSS feeds outbound at least (inbound nice too). And also add features to make interop really useful. I've enumerated them &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am making software that builds on this feature in social networks. And yes we do have some examples of that, thinking of WordPress and competitors. I think they are perfectly good bases for social networks.</description>

While it was going on Trump was calling Congresspeople saying if you stop the count I'll call off the attack. In other words, trade your life for a vote. I suspected it before, but they have testimony that verifies it.</description>

			<description>I'm doing some writing about writing and finding the phrase &quot;RSS, Atom and RFD&quot; too cumbersome. Most people don't care and see the distinctions as unnecessary. But I want to be accurate, and recognize that while RSS is the most-used kind of feed, there are others, and our software works with them. I'm trying this construction: &quot;RSS-compatible.&quot; I think that expresses the most important point, the choice of format is up to you, but now, by 2024, they all work pretty much the same way.</description>

			<description>Good morning. The main static server I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a143645&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; yesterday has been relocated to a fresh, new and apparently healthy server to perform its past duties. We're off to a good start this Tuesday morning.</description>

			<description>feedland.org runs on a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean server&lt;/a&gt;, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size relatively small scale server that can't expand, and the latter is designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of 2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment.</description>
