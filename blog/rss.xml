On CNN, one of the worst &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing&quot;&gt;sanewashing&lt;/a&gt; sources for our would-be despot. I can't imagine what happened there. Or maybe I can. Is it possible that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery&quot;&gt;owners&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; who might have gotten an education and possibly studied a little history from teachers who remembered WW II, and understood that Trump's lines are straight from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf&quot;&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe perhaps possibly maybe with only two weeks to go before the election started envisioning themselves and family on trains to American death camps. After all CNN ran some perceivably negative stuff about Trump, and who knows maybe President Trump won't be so discerning and might just have all media people euthanized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE&quot;&gt;It could happen&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe visions of their own mortality caught up with them and they decided to let Blitzer do what he can to douse the flames. Oddly the same thing seems to have happened at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/18/164631.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt; and the Atlantic, and Trump's former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html&quot;&gt;Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; has gone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/10/23/g-s1-29490/trump-john-kelly-fascist-dictator&quot;&gt;on the record&lt;/a&gt; now, with audio, explaining what we all know is waiting for us if the US actually goes down the path it appears we quite possibly are going down.</description>

			<description>I think it's probably too late, anyway. Journalism should have reported, constantly, that the house is on fire. And nothing else. Biden's age didn't enter into it you fools. The much bigger story was and is that Hitler wants to be president, and this time he has a plan. It was true then and it's true now. The next question is what will Biden do if Trump wins. It was tough watching Obama greet Trump at the White House in 2016. I can't see Biden doing that. I wonder what ideas they're workshopping in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_Room&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; Situation Room.</description>

			<title>The million-plus Americans Trump killed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/02/23/ronaldMcDonaldWithBomb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/21.html#a131028&quot;&gt;posted a bit&lt;/a&gt; about the &quot;million-plus Americans who died from Covid during Trump's tenure.&quot; It wasn't worded carefully enough, I should've had a lawyer review it. Yes, a lot of them died during Biden's tenure too. But I don't think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled, first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter, then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never said geez I was wrong about this, it's a killer, and btw thanks for saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don't tell me I'm biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he's the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven't voted yet, save us from concentration camps and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration&quot;&gt;mass deportation&lt;/a&gt;. One million Americans dead is far too many, let's not try to top that. Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got a notice that Threads had deleted one of my posts because they said it violated their rules. They thought I was claiming to have written something I had not written. I didn't keep the notice (it popped up when I signed on). I shrugged it off when I got it, but then realized that we are very far away from the web. It has been turned into Disneyland where the cops are algorithms and they err on the side of stopping innocent things. I was just passing on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rohan.ga/blog/early-internet/&quot;&gt;link to someone else's blog&lt;/a&gt;, something I thought an informed person would want to know about (that's the idea behind every link I share). We really do need to dig our way out of this hole, again. This is of course no better than Twitter or Facebook. Not a place to get work done.</description>

			<title>I'm sticking with WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm continuing to develop on WordPress. I see the opportunity regardless of what else is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- and that basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don't think that's very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father's memorial site, for example.

				<source:outline text="I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- and that basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us." created="Mon, 21 Oct 2024 15:53:37 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/155259.html#a155337"/>
				<source:outline text="But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is!" created="Mon, 21 Oct 2024 15:54:18 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/155259.html#a155418"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don't think that's very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father's memorial site, for example.

I didn't think the Mets would make it through any of the hurdles, making the playoffs, and beating the Brewers and Phillies. That was amazing. And the energy of this team, their humor and inventiveness, professionalism and perseverance. The Mets of 2024 were a great team, and they give us something to look forward to in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say Mets pitchers walked too many Dodgers, but the walks were a result of discipline on the part of the Dodgers hitters. Most pitchers throw a lot of crap, and the hitters swing at it. The Dodgers are more discerning. If the Mets pitchers had thrown strikes they would have hit home runs. It's another way of saying that the Dodgers, no matter how much we despise them, this year at least, were the better team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there is a silver lining. I wasn't sure I wanted the Mets to beat the Dodgers once we knew the team from the &quot;other&quot; league was going to be the Jankees. Last time the Mets played them in the World Series, they beat us in Shea Stadium and as a result we had to tear it down and start over. I don't think any of us wanted that, or even to risk having to tear down Citi Field. I don't like to be reminded that the Jankees even exist, much less be forced to watch them play. And honestly between the Dodgers and the other NY team, I want them &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; to lose. Is there any way to arrange that? I don't even want to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway thanks to the Mets for being such a wonderful team, a constant inspiration. So onward. Next year. And now..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks begin their season &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/sport/basketball/article/3283231/nba-season-opens-boston-celtics-eyeing-dynasty-and-knicks-chasing-first-title-1973&quot;&gt;tomorrow night&lt;/a&gt; in Boston against the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/20/warningMuskCouldPushTrumpOverTheTop.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; this morning about the reality of Musk owning Twitter, which is now completely settling in. He might have enough influence on the election to push Trump over. He wins even if Trump loses, he gets a moon mission project to boot up a Musk Party. It's coming for sure, either way. Probably will pick up what's left over after Trump, who clearly is losing it, and even if he's president, someone else will be pulling the strings. I can't imagine the billionaire will let JD Vance do it. And by &quot;billionaire&quot; I mean Musk.</description>

			<description>A second elimination game for the Mets tonight. I almost don't want the Mets to win, because the World Series opponent from the &quot;other&quot; league are the Janks from the Bronx. I love the Bronx. That's about all I have to say about that at this time.</description>

			<description>It's possible the Dodgers let the Mets win as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/18.html#a144749&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to yesterday, but it's also possible the Mets just &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/live/dodgers-vs-mets-new-york-bats-come-alive-in-game-5-sending-series-back-to-los-angeles-201027428.html&quot;&gt;crushed&lt;/a&gt; the Dodgers, but either way, the Mets are still in it. The series is now 3-2, and returns to Los Angeles tomorrow. So we don't have to tear down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field&quot;&gt;Citi Field&lt;/a&gt; after all. If the Dodgers win it'll be in their own stadium. The Mets were magnificent! Absolutely inspiring. A three-run home run by Alonso started things off. Everyone got on base. Doubles and triples. It wasn't without the concern that our wonderful and lovable Mets would do the usual Mets thing and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they held out. The final score was 12-6. We're still in it. Lets go Mets!</description>

			<description>Bloggers, here's an idea. When you write a piece you're proud of, end it with a sentence like this: &quot;And that's why I have a blog.&quot; It plants a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We've had a lot of mud slung at us, let's start undoing that.</description>

The song for tonight's game is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ObVQPBD0Uw&quot;&gt;Ain't Too Proud to Beg&lt;/a&gt; by the Temptations." created="Fri, 18 Oct 2024 14:47:49 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/18/grimace.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/18.html#a144749"/>

			<description>There's this great story in the Fargo TV series where one of the villains says there's a point when an animal that has been captured, relaxes when it realizes that it is no longer a being and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1msLSfeSc&amp;t=25s&quot;&gt;has become food&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;At some level food it knows it's food.&quot; Evolution has been kind to us that way. At what point in last night's game did you realize that the Mets were no longer a baseball team and had become food?</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Will the NYT make it through the election without running an editorial that says &lt;i&gt;clearly&lt;/i&gt; if we elect this mad king fascist and give him nukes and our military, and our industrial might, and what remains of our virtue, then we deserve the hell that will rain down on us.

And the most important thing -- they don't break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly. It means it's safe to develop here. It means there's discipline in their development organization. Most companies don't do this, but the ones who do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft's sins, they were incredibly good at this too. It's why I liked working with them, and also why we laughed at each others' jokes if you can believe that. In some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the concept of &quot;development org&quot; -- so I look at it that way. I dig around their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it'll work out pretty well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they're going to break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and completeness. They didn't rush off to the next thing before finishing. I found that in their Calypso API, which I've been building on. Honestly this is my kind of platform, it's what Manila's API would look like today probably if we had continued developing it. I'll see if I can find the docs around here somewhere. Long time ago. ;-)</description>

It should be as easy as reading a file. Give it the URL of a feed, get back a JavaScript object that's as simple as feeds are. It can read RSS, Atom and RDF feeds, but you get the same object regardless of what form the feed was in. I'm up for creating some example apps if you're interested. There is a very simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/example&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt; included in the package and a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos&quot;&gt;demo apps&lt;/a&gt;. It's MIT-licensed, so you can do whatever you want with the code. It would lovely to see it ported. The idea is to plant some seeds in the Node.js world to make it easy for developers to try out new ideas with feeds, figuring the easier it is, the more people will do it. Be creative. Blow our minds! :-)</description>

Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I'd say no. In 2003, I compiled a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/&quot;&gt;things that make a blog a blog&lt;/a&gt;, and it's not about the software you use, rather it's about who's writing it, and whether they're being edited. Now it's a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not. Because it forces you to use their editor. And that's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious&quot;&gt;pernicious&lt;/a&gt; form of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can't easily try out something new. You are not available to other software developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you. I know how well that kind of system works. And that's probably why they lock you into using their editor. If I can't switch without breaking everything, I'm not going there.</description>

It could both save and kill us. That's what's so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people aren't really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it might also kill you because you can't go back to being the person you were before. There might not be a path back. One thing's for sure we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; saving. We can't survive without radical change. We're on a path that doesn't work. Is there any way for us to change radically without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up control. But here's the funny thing about that. We aren't giving up anything because no one has any control. That's a political question in the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control. But he's 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could configure AI so it did what humans can't and won't do, at least our civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which is why I have a blog.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This morning I wrote about why I don't believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets pitcher Tug McGraw. It's on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter how it turns out I won't love the Mets any less if they lose. I think true believers believe in that -- love -- without any expectations, win or lose, or maybe &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering of the post isn't complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I'm working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I'm glad to see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in the things I believe in, not because I &quot;gotta.&quot; I don't like the slogan because it doesn't reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand that their fans don't love them any less because they lost. If anything I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wait+till+next+year!&quot;&gt;Wait till next year!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I thought that was both interesting and weird. I don't get how anyone I know can be a fan of the that team. An American League team in a National League city. Kind of like rooting for Staten Island. Anyway, the Yankees may win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2024_ALCS.shtml&quot;&gt;ALCS&lt;/a&gt;, but what does it mean? It's not going to make New York love them. But then Gruber is in Philadelphia so why isn't he thinking about the Phillies, who btw, the Mets beat soundly in the division series, earlier this month. In any case, I have made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/16/mets1969TeamPicture.png&quot;&gt;team picture&lt;/a&gt; of the 1969 world champion Mets as the banner image on Scripting News for now and into the forseeable future.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&quot;&gt;Gruber&lt;/a&gt; gave me an idea when he put his &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/16/daringFireballAndJankeesLogo.png&quot;&gt;NYY logo&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. I thought that was both interesting and weird. I don't get how anyone I know can be a fan of the that team. An American League team in a National League city. Kind of like rooting for Staten Island. Anyway, the Yankees may win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2024_ALCS.shtml&quot;&gt;ALCS&lt;/a&gt;, but what does it mean? It's not going to make New York love them. But then Gruber is in Philadelphia so why isn't he thinking about the Phillies, who btw, the Mets beat soundly in the division series, earlier this month. In any case, I have made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/16/mets1969TeamPicture.png&quot;&gt;team picture&lt;/a&gt; of the 1969 world champion Mets as the banner image on Scripting News for now and into the forseeable future." created="Wed, 16 Oct 2024 14:10:37 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/16/philliesPhanaticMascot.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/16.html#a141037"/>

I turned it off. I don't see this as a social network, I see it as a two-way publishing medium. Big fundamental difference. My words speak for me here and on Threads. It's a strong argument in favor of &quot;Follows&quot; being the default algorithm, btw.</description>

			<title>What's up with WordPress?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I ran a free service &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/faq&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+weblogs.com&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; didn't exist yet, so there was no way to find out which blogs had new stuff other than going through your blogroll and clicking links. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I built a simple server, running in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, that handled pings. When you updated your blog, you'd send a message to weblogs.com saying your blog updated. It would then read the HTML of the blog and verify that it changed, and it would be added to a list of blogs that updated, in reverse chronologic order. It also published an XML version of the update list called &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/changesXml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt;, so if you wanted to run a search engine off the list, you could do that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were several ways to send a ping. You could go to a web page and enter the URL of your blog. Or you could save the URL as a bookmark and click the bookmark when you updated. Or if you used blogging software like our Manila or Radio UserLand, or later EditThisPage.com or weblogs.com (which eventually hosted blogs itself), it could ping on your behalf, automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Aside: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/historyOfWeblogs&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the weblogs.com site, preserved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A number of search sites appeared. And we were happy, until another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt;, funded by venture capitalists, who expected a return on their investment, built on our open and free &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt; list, started asking for and receiving pings on their own, and (key point) they didn't make their change list public. This struck me as highly un-weblike and unfair, but they could do it and we had to live with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Based on what Matt has been saying it sounds to me like it's something like our experience. Except weblogs.com was a short term thing, and not a business, and it didn't last twenty years, and it didn't have a payroll to support. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it still felt wrong that they weren't giving back as they received. If it had persisted like WordPress has, it would have eventually been a seriously diseconomic and unsustainable problem. And I can imagine I might write about it publicly as Matt has  and maybe even get a famous lawyer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal&quot;&gt;Neal Katyal&lt;/a&gt; to advise me. And here we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have we heard anything from the other side, or anyone who is familiar with what their position might be. Do they not feel obligated to support the continued development of WordPress or maybe there's another issue we haven't heard about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine that Matt would make such a big deal out of this if it weren't actually a big deal. He probably knew in advance how disruptive this would be. And I imagine the others knew it would be too and counted on him not wanting to make a fuss. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have gotten embroiled in these kinds of things in the past, and I don't like it. I love to make software and make users happy and then make more software, round and round. Anything that involves lawyers is not me doing what I was made to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I do see a silver lining. As with twitter-like systems, I now see the possibilty to help WordPress serve writers better in the future. Before this, people didn't think change was possible in the WordPress world, like they didn't see the possibility of change with Twitter. But now Twitter has quite a bit of viable competition. I know that WordPress could be better tuned for writers, and the product has a very nice API that would make it possible for lots of writing tools to flourish. It is a strong platform that's debugged, scaled, documented and worked on for a long time, and they don't tend to break users. And where commercial vendors like Facebook and Twitter often have excellent technology, ultimately they are run by execs and bankers who don't believe in being open, where this is something that has been deeply ingrained in the WordPress culture from the beginning and would be hard to change and that's a good thing for users and developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the exciting part -- between WordPress and Twitter lies a product that would bring the web back to life. Imagine a twitter-like system with the writers features of WordPress. Amazingly, we are on the cusp of that being a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's lots of opportunity to better serve writers here, and that's what I love to do, and honestly I think Ghost and Substack have left themselves open to a writing environment built on WordPress that doesn't try to lock users in. And at the same time, I think we can use this platform to help all the twitter-like services to support all kinds of writing, not just severely limited tweets typed into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong idea that taking features out of the web was a good thing. I want to bring these features back so we can get going again with the web as a writer's platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don't need to think anyone is right or wrong here, and I don't think anyone else should either. I think this platform is very nicely open and we can do lots of interesting new stuff here. I hope to open a new thread here, focused on writers and the web. It's been too long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've seen video of a recent press interview where Trump said he's use the military to arrest and in some cases kill Americans, starting with but not limited to Hispanics. This is not being reported in the major news orgs. We can't wait for them to fix it, we have to create new channels for news flow that have credibility and work, and we need it before the election. People need at least have a &lt;i&gt;chance&lt;/i&gt; of understanding what they are voting for.</description>

I predict I'd watch far more stuff on Netflix than I do now. Or Apple TV, Max, Hulu, Disney, etc. The idea that such a valuable resource is not part of the user experience is crazy imho. What a waste. What reminded me of this is Plex has integrated the equivalent of Bingeworthy in their service, which is also a good idea and will glue communities of users to you. The idea is to systematize recommendations. If I know a specific friend liked a movie or a show is valuable information for me, not just advertisers.</description>

			<description>The common denominator between journalism, business and politics is that none of them have any respect for people. To rise in influence, money or power you have to give up imagination, and be ruled by cynicism. If you don’t believe this, show me a journalist who listens, a business that makes products for thinkers, or a politician who lets individual people lead them.</description>

			<title>Why is this possible now?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;BTW, the reason there's such a confluence of power between WordPress and Mastodon is this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js&quot;&gt;complete, debugged, deployed, scaled and frozen API&lt;/a&gt;. It's been around since 2016 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In contrast Mastodon, while they're doing excellent work, is trying to wrangle an already large community into a set of consistent interfaces. It's very hard for an outsider like myself to approach, esp when you're overloaded with your own work (which we all are).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Automattic has a small team whose only job is to make WordPress work with Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I can build software that works with Mastodon without venturing into the rough seas of Mastodon-land. I can stay on the cruise-liner, which is the WordPress API.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't even know they had this API until last summer. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. It even works with Node.js. And now that I'm on the other side, I haven't hit any insurmountable obstacles or had to wait for something to be decided.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the proper way to build interop. Implementors make things work, not W3C committees (I say that with decades of experience with this, btw).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought it deserved an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Payback time for the Dodgers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well we know who the Mets are facing, starting tomorrow, in the National League championship series. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Last time we played the Dodgers in the postseason we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2015_NLDS2.shtml&quot;&gt;kicked their ass&lt;/a&gt;. And now they have the nerve to show up again. Geez some people never learn. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we haven't forgotten how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRbFJo83mlg&quot;&gt;Chase Utley&lt;/a&gt; broke &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Tejada&quot;&gt;Rubin Tejada's&lt;/a&gt; leg, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/11/baseballGotUglyLastNight.html&quot;&gt;deliberately&lt;/a&gt;, basically ending his major league career. We thought he should have been arrested for that, no kidding -- it was a vicious un-baseball assault. He and the Dodgers showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://dodgers.mlblogs.com/off-day-report-mattingly-addresses-utley-tejada-a2ba255e751f&quot;&gt;no remorse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/12/payback.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The only payback that matters is victory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/12/mrMetAtBat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Update: The Jankees are playing Cleveland in the ALCS, and while some people with limited imaginations wish for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series&quot;&gt;Subway Series&lt;/a&gt; betw the the two NY teams, I do not. I have a rule, I always root for the team the Jankees are playing. Thus I hope to see a World Series between the Mets and so-called &quot;Guardians.&quot; And of course the Mets would be heavily favored in that contest because the Cleveland team has changed their name to something impossible to pronounce, ethically. When you change your name, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/09/21/silverLiningMetsBook.html#aIWPAT&quot;&gt;tearing down your stadium&lt;/a&gt; (something that took the Mets a long time to recover from) you basically put a hex on your team making it virtually impossible for your philosophy to prevail. So Mets v Guardians, while not necessarily what I predict, rather is something I &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;, and as long as the game is played with philosophy, that's the real victory! So get em METS and never forget there's always next year. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Summarizing the last 18 years on the web. Between Twitter and Google Reader, the web was cut into two, and they didn't get along. We may now be on the cusp of fixing that. Why? Because WordPress and Mastodon work with each other in unforeseen ways. We got lucky, because I don't think this was done consciously by the developers of either product.</description>

			<title>The web lives in WordPress and Mastodon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a morning ritual which begins with breakfast and iced coffee, and my laptop, on the kitchen table, to review the news, sports, whatever. Write a few tweets or share a few links. Usually with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/&quot;&gt;WNYC&lt;/a&gt; playing in the background until I find something I want to read carefully, then I shout at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; to go away. When done, I head upstairs where the work begins, often with a blog post, as I'm writing now, and sometimes with a bit of code, but that usually waits until my brain is warmed up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But today I had a different assignment. Instead of tweeting, I wrote a few wordpress/mastodon posts, a new hybrid, a medium that I may well be the first person to explore, to do actual writing in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/11/kong.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I have a writing tool I call wordLand, it connects directly to WordPress, and from there, one of my sites is hooked up to Mastodon via ActivityPub. I choose to view it that way, to keep from going crazy. I know that it's hooked up to the &quot;fediverse&quot; -- meaning my writing can be viewed by any other app that supports the protocol Masotodon supports which is kind of ActivityPub+ -- where the + is the Mastodon API. Not sure what the ratios are, and I don't care. In this context I am a user, and happy to be that. The developers at Automattic are taking care of the technical details. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the conclusion that appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113288911901690601&quot;&gt;one of the posts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in my kitchen this morning -- &quot;I am more excited about the web than I have been in a &lt;i&gt;lonnnnng&lt;/i&gt; time.&quot; I am. I explained why in one of my posts, but it comes down to this. I have most of the features I asked for in &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; (!) and I am typing in a respectable editing window, where I retain copies of my writing, and there's no freaking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt;. And because I'm hooking in through a protocol (here's the punchline) this writing can go anywhere. Anywhere. Let me say that again. Any. Where. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like I said the other day, I doubt if Automattic knows what they have. I seriously doubt it. But in a few years, we're going to look back on this as the moment when Twitter stopped controlling our writing, as they have since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No more character limits. Posts can have titles, or not. We can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/scripting/manila/bloggerCon/ruleoflinks.html&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;, as many as we like. Styling works.

The series is over, the next game on Sunday will be against the winner in the west, either San Diego or Los Angeles. Last night's game was stressful, low scoring, until the Mets star shortstop hit a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/video/francisco-lindor-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-center-field-starling-marte-score&quot;&gt;freaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;grand slam&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/francisco-lindor-sends-mets-to-the-nlcs-eliminates-phillies-with-grand-slam-in-nlds-game-4-035006801.html&quot;&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;, and that was all the scoring we needed. The Mets are the hottest team in baseball. It doesn't feel like a long time since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; when they got to the World Series before crashing.

And in the meantime, I caught a tiny bit of last night's preseason game between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bulletsforever.com/2024/10/9/24266653/washington-wizards-new-york-knicks-nba-preseason-game-recap&quot;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt; and some other team I don't care about. They have two new stars to add to the roster after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/isaiah-hartenstein-2024-free-agency&quot;&gt;losing one star&lt;/a&gt; as a free agent, and trading two others for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/karl-anthony-towns-trade-knicks-timberwolves&quot;&gt;second new star&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, very enticing. New York has some excellent sports teams, which is unusual, because it isn't just the Jankees this time, a team I will, I promise, &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; root for. Quite the opposite. I will root for whoever they are playing. You can probably tell I don't like them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Memorable TV-watching moments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/natalia_barbour/status/1806331423814484272&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that says something that's obviously true until you realize it's not. &quot;No kid remembers their best day in front of the TV.&quot; In fact I have four memories from my youth, watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I remember my father rolling around on the floor when the ball went through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18caPNisP2U&quot;&gt;Buckner's legs&lt;/a&gt;. My father &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; rolled around on the floor, before or since. But I liked seeing him let go just that once. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another with my father. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenWdylTtzs&quot;&gt;Beatles were on Ed Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; he said they were wearing wigs. He knew that because no man would actually have hair like that. I was 8 or 9 years old and remember telling him I didn't think he got that right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I remember exactly where I was when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwZb2mqId0A&quot;&gt;Neil Armstrong walked on the moon&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival&quot;&gt;Newport Folk Festival&lt;/a&gt; and about 500 people were watching a tiny TV on top of a VW bus. Somehow everyone could see. It was outdoors and it was silent, everyone was in awe.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One that's only peripherally about TV. I remember every time I went to see a game at Shea Stadium as a kid I was blown away by the color, because most of the Mets games I saw were on TV, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/JM0Q-czWSRk?si=vQjJd13u480XleVX&amp;t=36&quot;&gt;black and white&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's one from adulthood. Watching young Barack Obama give his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEo7lzfpdCU&quot;&gt;victory speech&lt;/a&gt; on election night in 2008 in my house in Berkeley with a group of friends, with tears running down all our faces.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>
