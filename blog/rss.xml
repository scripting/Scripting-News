I could show it what wasn't working with a screen shot. Amazingly it understood and made the connection to the software we were working on, and suggested a modification that made it work properly. This was an important missing bit of functionality, previously you had to explain in words what wasn't working visually. That worked too, but was cumbersome. Much easier to just show it was wrong. And the UI couldn't be simpler. Take the screen shot at paste it into the box where you normally type. It starts analyzing before you press Enter.</description>

			<description>Jon Stewart from this Monday is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmxzQJt80XI&quot;&gt;good to watch&lt;/a&gt; as a reminder of what the press could be doing beyond what Jay Rosen recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice. (Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1798365545106141236&quot;&gt;Jay is on it&lt;/a&gt;.)</description>

Podcasts give you the listener all the power. If you give it up it'll all be Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me messages about all the new &quot;podcasts&quot; they have. I mutter under my breath when I hear this, some expletive I'd rather not repeat. Amazon, the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play fair. You'll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn't be surprised if the users reward you for it.</description>

			<description>What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she makes millions from a medium that doesn't give users much choice (ie MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.</description>

			<description>The test for whether it's a podcast or not is if they say you can get it &quot;Wherever you get your podcasts.&quot; If they can say that, it's a podcast. If you have to get it from Apple or YouTube or whoever, it's not a podcast. That's the rule.</description>

It would be nice if it just said &quot;I don't know&quot; but it's early, and they haven't figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs. I can't wait for the first aha! from a journalist -- who will say this: &quot;Aha! Now I see what this is for and it's freaking lovely.&quot; But they've decided it sucks and that's that. Too bad, we're going on without them. And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers from totally screwing it up.</description>

			<description>In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After 30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver of knowledge as humans, &lt;i&gt;the machine knows all of it.&lt;/i&gt; And that's just programming. I'm just guessing that everything is that way. You know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/6c5a6426-62f9-48c1-9995-b4ae6f808907&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; in The Matrix Reloaded where we're told &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?si=7GMMS7dBvZW5cOag&amp;t=165&quot;&gt;no one knows&lt;/a&gt; how the technology works. That's where we are now. Spend your whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we didn't know we needed it. That's where we are now, and the journos are sitting on the sidelines hurling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spitballs&quot;&gt;spitballs&lt;/a&gt; at it.</description>

Today I was asked how I feel about podcasting now. Here's what I said. It's still working -- people expect to have choice in where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that's true they will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over tomorrow, I'd be happy with the outcome. It's been over 20 years since we rolled it out, and it's still delivering huge value to lots of people, and isn't controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are no gatekeepers. If only we had been able to keep blogging free of that kind of control, but I have hope there too.</description>

			<description>One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png&quot;&gt;status messages&lt;/a&gt; are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.</description>

			<description>We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode&quot;&gt;pseudocode&lt;/a&gt;. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.</description>

			<description>Another great application for ChatGPT. Try to find a blog post or article about the design of a language that gets to what you want to know without wading through a lot of stuff you don't care about. I got it to explain Swift, Go and Rust quickly. Okay now I know what they're doing. It would have taken me days to assemble this, and I never have that kind of time for such execursions.</description>

And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and &lt;i&gt;isn't that what we want?&lt;/i&gt; To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.</description>

			<description>If you make a podcast client, I'd like to have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;OPML list&lt;/a&gt; of all the feeds I'm subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my feed reader. I'd really like it to go the other way, actually, so I could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It's very important that it use OPML, that's the standard for this stuff. I couldn't possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on these standards. The client I use is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt; which is part of Automattic. BTW, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://editsubscriptionlists.opml.org/&quot;&gt;use Drummer to edit&lt;/a&gt; a subscription list. Its native format is OPML.</description>

If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.</description>

It's the story of tech. Something new and explosive comes out, and the journalists feel threatened by it (always, in every way, even when it has nothing to do with them) and a few others (music industry with Napster, artists with ChatGPT) see amateurs invading their previously exclusive space. Truth is these new technologies give new tools for expression of ordinary untrained people. Now we get to have fun with sharing what we see, and maybe the professionals have to reorient themselves to the rest of the world. One thing you can't do and hope not to be left behind, is ignore the new tech, if you want to understand, don't depend on what you read in the news orgs, because they are always full of shit about new tech. You have to go discover it for yourself. And when someone says they're blown away by the new stuff they can do, listen to them, don't argue, try to understand. There's a lot of growth locked up in understanding. So please read the piece, we're at one of those points now wrt to ChatGPT. Sure, it knows a lot of stuff, that's great, but there's also it's ability to listen and understand us. This is what's really new here.</description>

			<description>Sometimes the On This Day feature in Facebook surfaces some questions that should be asked regularly. For example. 1. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02MA2JoTwY1oEYhuxmhuvarmVsaMqX6Gi6dADc3i8C8acFK3j3xNdw6W8GrG2vnoNgl&quot;&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt; what do librarians think of ChatGPT. Only one response. Maybe more this year. If there are any librarians blogging about their experiences with ChatGPT, please send me a link and I will add them to my AI category. If &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; is writing about new discoveries they've made, I want to hear about it.</description>

			<title>Trump today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I try not to post pictures of Trump on this blog since he left office in 2021, but this is too good not to share. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/06/01/trumpOnEscalator.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Pretty sure this is a meme, not an actual New Yorker cover. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
