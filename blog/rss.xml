It's not a big surprise as the US behaves like a drunk &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger&lt;/a&gt; deluded schoolyard bully. What is amazing, if you think about it, is that we aren't having an emergency impeachment and trial to get him out of there. That could actually restore a bit of confidence of the outside world, showing that the power in the US is more with the people than it has been for a long time. Maybe our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa&quot;&gt;would-be overlords&lt;/a&gt; are scared too at what their idea has unleashed. Even if Trump weren't so inept, eventually whoever you choose as the monarch, they're going to behave like this. Inevitable. We could have a revolution right now, fix this, and set the country on the right course. We could do it. I believe we could.</description>

I wasn't satisfied with the blog post I wrote in March. I felt it was poorly organized and hard to understand, so I edited it, to get it down to its essential elements, and at the end explain why it's so important to get this right. Basically, by trying to be the universe, Bluesky is cutting off easy connections that can be made with other networks, make the system work better for communication, and at least deliver &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of the freedom we all want. They've been very successful, and deserve to profit from that, but recognize it plays a larger role today than just as a business, so let's spread it out so it's harder to shut it down. This is a real concern, not just a nice-to-have thing.</description>

			<description>Just tried an &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67efabbd-1758-8012-a19b-a912cd72944a&quot;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;, I asked ChatGPT to review &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; re &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. I totally concurred with its conclusions. In any case, it illustrates how ChatGPT can be helpful in designing new formats and protocols, making them more supportable and more useful for interop, which according to Rule 1, is the only reason we make standards.</description>

			<description>One thing led to another, we discussed lots of facets to the RFSM document. At some point it started rewriting what I had, and used two terms that don't belong in standards-making: dogfood and deprecate. Nothing ever is deprecated. That's arrogance on the part of developers. Imagine if someone in charge of NYC decided to deprecate the arrangement of the streets. Also, if your protocol achieved any adoption at all, there are far more developers than there are originators of the format. If I decided, for example, that the &quot;webmaster&quot; element in RSS was deprecated, do you think anyone would care? Of course not, nor should they. It's a powerless thing. I feel you should introduce features carefully because you will have to live with them forever. Also I thought there was a section in RFSM about breakage. That was Rule #1 at UserLand. We didn't always live up to it. About dogfood:  I don't eat dog food, I'm a human. 2. It says we think of our users as pets, that's not rational or productive. However I do very strongly believe you have to use what you create, because you won't understand what users say unless you are one yourself.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;They're still &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing&quot;&gt;sanewashing&lt;/a&gt; Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Example. Just listened to Brian Lehrer, a news interview and call-in show on WNYC, which I revere, for many reasons. Lehrer is smart, and doesn't dumb things down for his audience. He usually asks the question I'm dying to hear the answer to, which most reporters don't think of or won't ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the March 27 they had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/bl-daily-politics-podcast/articles/columbia-university-faces-the-prisoners-dilemma&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about Trump's assault on Columbia University, which has now been extended to Harvard and Princeton. In all of them, the main issue is antisemitism at these universities.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Never in the discussion did they raise this question --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do we believe that Trump cares about antisemitism?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if he did, there are much bigger antisemites who are much more powerful and much closer to Trump (who is an obvious antisemite himself).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll mention just one -- Elon Musk, who actually did the Nazi salute, twice, from the podium with the Presidential Seal on it, at the freaking inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk has also backed the German Nazi party (they have a different name but to use that name would be NaziWashing, which I won't do).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Occam's truth is that he's tying antisemitism to things because it's fun for him, and because later -- they will blame Jews for everything that's wrong in the US, as they always do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The whole thing of Trump being a champion for Jewish people made me really uneasy, until I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyder.substack.com/p/antisemitism-and-antisemitism&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in Timothy Snyder's newsletter, which I recommend to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I trust Brian Lehrer, I don't think he'd shirk a tough question, I just think as a journalist he still isn't thinking realistically about the world as it is now, instead behaving as he did before it got so rotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is art?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/27/131121.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; four new ChatGPT-created drawings, created with the latest upgrade of ChatGPT's drawing functions which are better than previous versions. The usual controversy is rekindled on the networks. The concern as always is that it learned how from human artists, puts artists out of business, and human artists create art, machines can't, and since this is created by software, it isn't art. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This gives me a chance to write a piece I've been wanting to write for a while. The meaning of art imho comes from what it says to and about the person observing it, what it does to them, how it changes them, what they experience. For most people, most of the time, they don't have any idea who created the art beyond their name, nationality and when they lived. If you see enough of their work, you learn about the work, not the person. What you learn from art is always going to be about yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father once told me, in all seriousness, the cliche about an abstract work of art -- it isn't art, my father said. I said to him, Dad that you feel so strongly about it means to you it most definitely &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; art. I believe if he were more truthful about his response, he would say what's behind the feeling, he's experiencing dishonesty, stolen valor, the artist is a profiteer, the person who made it a &lt;i&gt;con&lt;/i&gt; artist not a real artist. Pretty similar to what people say in 2025 about art-making machines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Is software art?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe it is. When people say my software thinks like they do, what's really happening is the software has gotten out of their way, they've incorporated the way it works into the base of their spine, so they can remain in the world they're writing about, and forget that they're using a piece of software. They perceive that as the software thinking like they do, which is fine -- it's the goal. But it's quite possible they have a totally different experience that takes them out of their suspension of disbelief by not working the way they expect, the same way it did the last 100 times, or it failes to open a file, or whatever might cause them to leave their own world and have to deal with the one I, and generations of software developers, have created, which can (as I know) be excruciating, humiliating, and whatever else you may feel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've been doing tests for the last 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First I gave it a screen shot of WordLand and asked for a nice colorful poster for the product. Then I had it make a movie poster for Mutiny on the Bounty with different actors, and As Good as it Gets, and then a stunning rendering of an El Salvador news photo in the style of Edward Hopper. It refused to do an R Crumb rendering or Doonesbury, but it was OK with Hopper.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/wordlandPoster.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;WordLand poster by ChatGPT. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/mutinyOnTheBounty.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Belushi and Jeff Bridges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/asGoodPoster.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;As Good as it Gets starring Jackie Gleason and Melissa McCarthy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/noemInElSalvadorPrison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;An Edward Hopper rendering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/noemActual.png&quot;&gt;Secretary Noem&lt;/a&gt; at the El Salvador prison.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Join a parade today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This morningâ€˜s &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/26/join-a-parade-today/&quot;&gt;early morning missive&lt;/a&gt; from WordLand..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Talking with friends about What To Do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I actually have an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all try to lead a parade, with a big viral idea, if only everyone would follow me, it might just work. A lot of us have that feeling. My advice â€” it doesnâ€™t work. Lose it. Instead, find a parade you can join, and add your energy, talent and experience to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have a tremendous oversupply of would-be parade leaders, we need to build momentum, and it doesnâ€™t really matter what it is or who leads it. As long as itâ€™s something the press can cover. A movement that begets more motion. A huge march in DC. Demonstrations at Tesla dealers. Blogging in a group. Helping an existing group route around an outage. Making a great list of causes others can join. Reading a blog and finding the thing the blogger is looking for. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thereâ€™s great satisfaction in joining a righteous cause thatâ€™s working, my bother, my sister.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This goes back to something observed in standards work. The standard is set by the person who goes second, not the one who goes first. The person who chooses to interop instead of blazing a new incompatible trail. We should celebrate people who support others as much as we do the one who goes first. You need both, and the thirds and fourth adopters to create a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At a time like now when thereâ€™s no room for error or individual ego, as Ben Franklinâ€™s so wisely said during Americaâ€™s revolution, we must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: One way facebook can cripple a nascent movement, by the algorithm not showing you parades you might like too much. Remember Zuck is trying to ingratiate himself to trump. I find Iâ€™m seeing posts of vital interest to me over 24 hours after they were posted, when 165 people have already liked it. Suspicious behavior. We need to own our own social net. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This philosophy led me to build on WordPress as a foundation, instead of building my own, which I am fully capable of. Itâ€™s working much better this way, so far. Could the be a way toward our own social net? Possibly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Doc's approach to WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Watching Doc Searls use WordLand to post to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's using it the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4100j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; worked for blogging in the late 90s early 00s. Every day is a new page, which contained as many items as you liked. When you add a blank line that starts a new post. It's Markdown kind of a approach to structuring text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a point where you click the &lt;i&gt;Flip Home Page&lt;/i&gt; button. You can do that once a day. Each day is a fresh start. Each day gets its own archive page. The software can automate some of that, but it's trivial to do it by hand. A nice daily ritual. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The RSS feed we generated looked for two Returns in the text, that started a new &amp;lt;item&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Manila eventually adopted Blogger's approach, but I always liked this way because it said a blog post can be a very small thing. That was certainly the way I write. Some ideas don't require a lot of writing, so why should they take up so much space? I'm trying to make sure that as WordLand evolves, it treats little things and big things with equal respect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically Doc is doing manually what Manila did for you, but it's not a lot of work, he just clicks the + icon to create a new post, when he wants a fresh start. He has to choose a site from a popup, and then he's ready to write. The advantage is he has them all arrayed for him to make a change where ever he likes. I have that when I write in Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's not getting the benefit of the RSS treatment in Manila. Both WordPress and WordLand see that as one post, not N posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Below is a screen shot of Docs blog, and below it, in contrast is a page generated by Manila in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/26/docsBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;A screen shot of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/25/there-they-go/&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; in the life of Doc's new blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/26/scriptingscreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/08/28.html&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; in the life of Scripting News in 2001.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the michegas. My advice -- please -- do your protesting, resisting, DEIing, organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself with love even if the world isn't. So in that spirit for those of us who love cats -- a &lt;a href=&quot;https://prisonjournalismproject.org/2024/10/23/cats-came-to-my-california-prison/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I live in a place now with a score of zero, you can't do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019&quot;&gt;score&lt;/a&gt; of 99. I'd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out. Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its network, but doesn't reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).</description>

But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs)." created="Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:57:17 GMT" type="outline" image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/04/17/asGoodAsItGets.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/25.html#a105717"/>

			<description>I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy editor would. I hope we're heading there. And if they have this, put it behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an experienced copy editor to do imho.</description>

			<description>We're getting into WordPress in a new way, the need for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/64&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt; came from users. I didn't know they had this feature in WordPress. If you asked me if it did, I would have said yes, I'm sure it does, but where and what is it called? i could've gotten that too via chatgpt, but i would have had to think of it. that's where having sharp users makes a world of difference. When people thank me for my generosity, they don't get it. I want something out of it, your experience and your mind. It's one of my main raw materials.</description>

			<description>With all the good stuff happening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; I haven't found time to wind down feedland.com and feedland.org. The servers are still working, though not performing as I'd like them to, but it doesn't seem I'm going to get the time to do a graceful transition before my self-imposed March 31 deadline. So I'll come up with a new plan, and if you're using either of these services, enjoy! and keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/forewarned-is-forearmed&quot;&gt;backing up&lt;/a&gt; your subscription list.</description>

			<title>Paving cowpaths</title>

A few months back someone told me that I had been gone from the podcast world for too long for anyone to listen to me. I thought how weird, I didn't go anywhere at all, I stayed exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; I was, all the time. Virtually every day. If people cared to know what I think they could have found out pretty quickly because I am of course an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB&lt;/a&gt;. I talk about what I think all the time. (And besides, why do you care where you get ideas from, I don't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idea was about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcasting/index.opml#1733322866000&quot;&gt;feature for podcasting&lt;/a&gt; that would open up doors for influencers and ad hoc networks of podcasts, instead of a few dozen weak (imho) attempts to build synergy, I trust that invisible hand Darwinian ecosystem builds better networks, because they are real, not contrived. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Give the people the tools and see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Users and developers party together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the opposite of the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; approach to technology, instead it's &quot;paving the cowpaths,&quot; the process that has always fascinated me and been the method to my madness. Make the tools, give them to the people and sit back and hope something happens. When it doesn't try to show the way. And try out lots of these kinds of ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This method really works, and it isn't destructive, it's totally constructive.

It's pretty much the same thing as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrapping&lt;/a&gt;, which I also advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
