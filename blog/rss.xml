They have two more games to play with the Braves, but there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/25/atlantaWeather.png&quot;&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; headed &lt;a href=&quot;https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=33.7485&amp;lon=-84.3915&quot;&gt;toward&lt;/a&gt; Atlanta. It's going to start raining at 1PM and won't stop until Friday afternoon. It's the end of the season and both the Braves and Mets are in the same wildcard battle. Do the Mets stay in Atlanta to ride out the storm, or head back to NY? It's far more weird than I have time to explain right now.</description>

			<description>Now that ActivityPub is &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/09/24/launch/&quot;&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web&quot;&gt;Social Web&lt;/a&gt;, I feel like Lloyd Bentsen at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator,_you%27re_no_Jack_Kennedy&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; with Dan Quayle. ActivityPub is not the web any more than Dan Quayle was Jack Kennedy. The web is simple. That was hard to do. Very little since then lives up to that standard of simplicity, definitely not ActivityPub. The web is the web is the web is the web etc. Pick another more humble name. If it ever does achieve the utility of the web does we can take another look.</description>

			<description>It would be great if we could make voting a party, a celebration, something to look forward to, not something you have to make time for. That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because we are the stars.</description>

			<title>A Hello World for Bluesky?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, a couple of examples/case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;1. About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node made it click. It's server software, so there must be a way to write an HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has, but what I needed was a Hello World script. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt; gave me the script, and step by step &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to write it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.  That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is, and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP server, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with a server that ran in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. I was ecstatic. That's the key. If you have something that isn't truly new, that might have some analogies in other worlds, if you want people in those other worlds to know how to get started, give them the beginning. The first step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was 1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use it, but I didn't know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense, because they talked about things I didn't understand. What I really needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how to use. I found one, a service provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html&quot;&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;. You emailed a message to them and they put it &quot;on the web&quot; and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and there's what you typed. I tried &lt;i&gt;Hello World&lt;/i&gt; and got back a link to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated, I did a view source of Hotwired.com's home page, and copy and pasted it into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were relative). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything I've ever learned how to do required me to first understand it at this level.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay here we are in 2024, and I want to understand what Bluesky is. I know how to use it, but I don't know how to &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; it. But I would be surprised if it is any more complicated that writing a web content management system that uses feeds, something I've done many times. I know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We're all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I hear there's some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don't care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the same kind of aha moment I had with the web. I want it to work when I try it, and I want it to reveal what Bluesky is beyond what I can see from using it. I want to begin to understand the opportunities for interop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why do I ask? For one, I'm a student of this stuff, and I want to understand. But I also am very active in this area, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop is my product&lt;/a&gt; (really read that piece, I mean it, and I think it's Bluesky's product too). I'm into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; -- it happens so infrequently. So here I'm also trying to show not just you how to explain what you do for a curious but time-limited developer, but I want to make this a this.how document that explains how to do it for everyone, hoping that we as an art and industry start explaining ourselves better to each other, because we absolutely need to do this much better imho, ymmv, mmlm, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To summarize -- assume I know how the web works. I've worked with the structures and protocols for systems that are very much like Bluesky. Don't try to explain the design of the protocol, just use it to solve a problem that I will understand because I use the product and I have developed lots of stuff like it. It should be possible to show us, to teach us, what your product does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It could take a few days to put a Hello World together. Because once you do the first iteration, you may think of a more direct way to illustrate the idea, and you should do it, iterate until it works, until you can't make it any simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: And if you don't want to do it, that's okay too. I just thought it was worth the effort to explain what's needed to foster a greater understanding of what you're doing and what the opportunities for interop are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It shipped 17 days go. It was hell to just tell Google that the case was lost. I expected at that point they'd apologize and refund the money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return the case when it arrives. It's never going to arrive. Luckily this is a cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1300 phone, that would be a pretty big problem. It's amazing that a company the size and age of Google doesn't have a procedure for dealing with products that are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I've been through this with Amazon, they knew what to do, because UPS does lose packages, esp ones that look like they have phones in them. Anyway I have a fairly large credit with Google. I don't dare use it to purchase anything else, given how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer problems.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;BTW, to be clear, I have no interest in working on twitter-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's been like a prison to writers, we're stuck with this huge divide, with crap on both sides.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These things exist, they have a jumble of APIs and ways to integrate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we've been playing by the rules laid down by Twitter (ev, biz and jack) for 18 freaking years. That's enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not expecting much more to happen there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting &quot;both sides,&quot; how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for you all to get in sync with the actual American history that's being made.</description>

The problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified it as 0.</description>

			<title>Health is nothing to screw with</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since I'm about to turn 70 (next May), and because my body is getting old in ways it never has before (of course) -- I've become a more active participant in the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned is it can be hard to get the attention of the doctors. And once you see your GP about a problem it's almost certain they're going to send you to a specialist. So you go to the specialist and it's pretty random as to whether they put the effort into understanding your situation in full. And they aren't trying to solve all your problems, just the ones they deal in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, a couple of years ago I had a condition that ChatGPT diagnosed in a second but it took the doctors who weren't paying much attention (my primary care doctor had retired and I was being shuffled between NPs and MDs until they could find someone to be my new main doctor) so they were all sending me to the wrong specialists, all of whom said there was no problem, yet I still had the symptoms which were getting worse. On the fourth try, someone sent me to the right specialist and they instantly diagnosed what ChatGPT had diagnosed at the outset. So when people say AI could hurt medical care, I don't think so, it would probably be a good idea to have an AI looking over their shoulders and asking if they've considered the Occam's Razor specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you have to be alert, and push to get them to pay attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And communicating with the system is ridiculous. Almost everything has to be done over the phone. They have email, but if you want to set up an appointment, you have to call. And wait on hold. And wait and wait. And then it's a dice roll as to who you get connected to. There are some people you talk to who seem to be trying to be annoying. It's a total pain in the ass, but you have to do it. (And since they have to ask for your birthdate to identify you they know how old you are and treat you accordingly.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the health care for a person my age seems to be directed at finding the thing that's going to kill you and treating it. That's good, and that's a shift in perspective from someone who until recently had a young body which basically took care of itself. Or so it seemed (I did have emergency heart surgery at 47 that saved my life, although that's a fairly distant memory now).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So right now I have a thing that needs to be looked into because it might be one of those serious things. And it's really hard to get the system to respond quickly, because if it's serious it's one of those things that you want to deal with asap. I don't think it is, but you have to act as if it might be. And it can be humiliating to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's no law saying the doctor, or any of the others in the system, could go to jail or lose their license if they treat any illness I might have. I can now for the first time really understand what it might be like to have to deal with that in addition to all the other &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt; stuff you have to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the point of this post. Throwing a wrench into the already broken wheels of our medical system is the crime. They should go to prison for doing this, the six Supreme Court justices and other Republican assholes who stick their noses where they don't belong. There should be a penalty for what they're doing, they should have the fear they're putting women through. They should worry about what happens when their decision is overturned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they should lose their medical care as should all the members of their families. Then they might get an idea of how sinful they have been.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first draft of this post appeared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02emJvNBVscbSVgUsRaxg6tCWPYcZnfsJy7W2Tp6WU6iKfNtLVgKU8Nh69z8vmkGf8l&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017 corner-turn&lt;/a&gt; was about getting back to the foundation I had before trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no longer high value targets for interop. So while I wasted a lot of time trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/08/152655.html&quot;&gt;peer&lt;/a&gt; with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup while developed &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and in doing so learned how to do scalable server apps with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;. I've wasted so much time trying to be compatible with apps that didn't want us. I have a feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let's get back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;Open Web&lt;/a&gt;, which gave us much hope before. I think we can do a lot with feeds and &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. They're to open systems what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt; is to open source. You don't get to be half-committed to being open, you have to be all-in or you can't play. (Same idea as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+podcasting&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, which of course is just an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.) You don't have to deal with a lot of confusion to find the interop. You just have to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post and look what it has become.</description>

			<description>Has anyone attempted to make a higher level language on top of SQL? It's taken me a few iterations over years to finally (I hope) figure out how to design a table to take advantage of the features that evolved into making SQL efficient for the applications people really deploy. If this were machine language, it would be time to start thinking about the HLL that it inspires. Actually long past time imho.</description>

			<description>My Pixel 9 Pro keeps giving me tips on using it when I bring it up, as I'm trying to read an important message, or change something at a red light. I'm always distracted when I use the phone, and by adding more distractions to sell me on something, that's not their right. I paid $1300 for this new phone. And also I can't figure out how to get the phone to ring when I get a call. I keep missing important calls.</description>

			<description>Note to self: When the phone doesn't ring, go to Settings - Sound &amp; vibration - Do Not Disturb. It was on for some reason. I'm sure I didn't set this.

			<description>I keep discovering uses for ChatGPT. I think it would be very useful to learn a language, for example. I know how to say this in English, could you explain to me, in English, how to say it in French. I bet it's very good at that. I am using it to learn to write SQL code that takes advantage of all the arcane features they've added over the years to handle cases that come up in real database work. It's anything but a new language, and efficiency is everything -- so I think they pretty much have all the cases covered. I remember how frustrating it was to learn Algol when all I knew before that was Fortran and Basic. It would have been great to have ChatGPT to coach me on it.</description>

I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so I drive at the speed limit or a little above. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates, getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road, deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never hit an animal, but I have come close.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to pass on this road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been in the other driver's place when a tourist is driving 30 in a 45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don't freak out. It's perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their horn. I slow down more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking okay they'll pass me now, and I'll get a chance to see who this asshole is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we come to the next stop sign, it's the end of the road and you can go left or right. I'm going right, they're going left, and the road is wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last kind of person I would expect to make such a scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I don't speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn't in any kind of a hurry. It's not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when I slow down and add a few car lengths between us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these stories. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to &quot;just happen&quot; organically.</description>

This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to &quot;just happen&quot; organically." created="Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:55:05 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/05/21/stillAVirgin.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/17.html#a135505"/>

			<title>How I cross-post to Threads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;The RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; is doing a lot of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links from the RSS feed show up on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;give&lt;/a&gt; it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; of the linkblogging feed, and then click on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png&quot;&gt;Add Threads&lt;/a&gt; -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;Feeds page&lt;/a&gt; is where you set it up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ignore polls</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want a better idea of how it's going, look at where the ad dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And make sure all your friends know that you're voting and who you're voting for.

I'd like to ask for a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry&quot;&gt;Chuck Berry&lt;/a&gt;, and get something nice and be able to put him in a scene with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wordle+kitty%22&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt;. That seems pretty harmless. And the news industry could hardly object, they didn't invent Chuck Berry, or own the copyright of the picture of him in Wikipedia.</description>

			<description>I'm searching for some common ground between the twitter-like systems, a basis for interop, a common API even. We had that for the blogging layer of this onion, something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;.  All the popular blogging software supported it. And that meant you could write once and publish to many places. And you could write the script that did that in an afternoon or two. We started out with simple systems and the best of intentions. There's no technical barrier. And we could do it in a few weeks at most if there was a will to do it</description>

			<description>BTW the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaWeblog&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for the MetaWeblog positions it as a replacement for the Blogger API, but it's an extension of it. You could use MetaWeblog to publish to Blogger sites, but it also supported features that Blogger didn't have, that were in our blogging software, Manila.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C_5i0bLpwNe&quot;&gt;Hecklers&lt;/a&gt; at last night's rally in Greensboro, couldn't hear what they were angry about, but it had something to do with Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The US isn't doing the killing there, the issue is with Netanyahu who is part of the same political party as Trump. So you can be pretty sure the killing won't stop there at least until after our election. One way to be sure the killing continues is to elect Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's good to laugh</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's wonderful that we're laughing at Trump now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a joke to think that after all he took us through, there are 47% of the people in the country who want more of that! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OMG we must be crazy. What else are you going to do but laugh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

These were the good days, a new medium in its early stages of booting up, after years of trying to get it to go. In the next few weeks, it'll really start going.

			<description>I keep seeing mention of &quot;Podcast 2.0&quot; in various places. That is unusually greedy, even for the tech industry. What next? Deprecating the way podcasting has worked for the last 20 years? How do we know the people doing this aren't shilling for Spotify, Google or Amazon? Please don't mess with something that works as well as podcasting. You want to do something better, great -- make your own name and get people to respect it. Stealing respect from podcasting tells me you have no honor or self-respect, and it should say the same to everyone else. Something else that tells you it's bad, they never bothered to send me an email. Welcome to the tech industry.</description>

			<description>Just watched a Harris rally in Charlotte NC. She's using what Trump said in the debate in her new campaign speech. Brilliant. Getting him on the record in that context is a gift. 60 million viewers. Up till then he only took interviews where he could bully his way past the interviewer.</description>

A couple of months ago, I was practically begging him to do this. He was pouring so much unfocused energy into making journalism play an appropriate role in our democracy.
