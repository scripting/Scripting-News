			<title>Quiet mode for the blogroll</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After living with the blogroll on the home page of Scripting News for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html&quot;&gt;about a month&lt;/a&gt;, and having heard from early testers, I felt that it was demanding too much attention when I was reading stuff on the blog. So I made some time last week to experiment with a subtler sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet Mode,&lt;/i&gt; the blogroll doesn't call attention to itself until you click on it. Then its background changes from neutral to white. That's the equivalent of shining a spotlight on it. Also the borders become blue to indicate that the browser's focus is on the blogroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do more to tone it down. So, in Quiet Mode the title moves up and to the left, and is in a much smaller font, boldface, nicely visible and stands off from the list, but doesn't call your attention to it. It's there when you want to know more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You may want to call it something other than a blogroll, btw. If you're using blogs to coordinate projects with others, something I think a lot more people would do if it worked better, instead of &quot;blogroll&quot; you'd might call it your &quot;workgroup.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have switched &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; over to the new quiet mode, it's already the default, but I put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/20/checkbox.png&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/a&gt; just below the blogroll that lets you toggle between the two modes to see the difference and possibly spot problems. The checkbox will go away before long. I just want it there to quickly do an A-B comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zfNS97NUHB4&quot;&gt;quick video demo&lt;/a&gt; of Quiet Mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/304&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment or ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The two concepts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality&quot;&gt;orthogonal&lt;/a&gt;. I do not support the Israeli government any more than I supported the government of my country, the United States, when the MAGAs were in charge. We lost over 1 million Americans who did not have to die imho, because our government was not only immoral and hugely corrupt, but also made no attempt to govern. I am a child of Holocaust survivors and an American born in the USA, and am proud of and grateful to my country. Any American is free to protest the actions of our government or any other government, or really anything. If you don't believe in that then you aren't actually trying to make America great, you're saying something altogether different and incompatible. I am American. I am also deeply offended at other Americans who propose to speak for me. That actually is antisemitic, btw.</description>

			<description>Quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.ai/&quot;&gt;meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;. This is a demo of just one feature, its ability to recalc drawings as you edit the prompt that defines the picture. As you can tell from the demo I love it because it's new, creative, super fun to use and to watch the result. And lovely to see this much progress so quickly. You really should watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; so you can see how what I type relates to the image in real-time. It's like subtitles inverted, with a very knowledgeable, creative and high bandwidth computer network behind it. Living in the future.</description>

			<title>WordPress For One</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;More and more I'm getting used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; as the platform I develop for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you, as a developer, could add your own data to a WordPress post. Then you could build editors that work at a higher level. For example, you'd keep the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html?title=markdownIsJustEnoughHtml&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; source for the page. When it was saved the system would re-render the Markdown, turning it into HTML, but you'd still have the Markdown around for editing. And of course there are other kinds of editors that make sense, knowing that the output is going to the web, but you don't have to &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; in the technical language of the web. You might want something more suited to wordsmiths -- ie &lt;i&gt;writers, &lt;/i&gt;if you are a writer. I have that working here, and have been building on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've gone back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/radio/screenshots.opml?permalink=20240219144035&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; and tried to extrapolate, where would we have gone with that product, 22 years later. And now I'm beginning to see in the pieces that are forming the new product I've been working on, something whole, something that works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of it as &quot;WordPress For One&quot; -- you might be writing as part of a larger site, but this is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; writing space, a place you can mold to fit your style, where it gets more comfortable over the years, more you. That's what I've felt has been wrong with the direction the web has been going in, we're getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;boxed&lt;/a&gt; into smaller and smaller spaces, but for some of my writing I want a nice stage with good lighting and full freedom to tell a story that I have to tell, not necessarily all at once, but possibly in a series, over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also want to be influenced by your story. I want &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;Working Together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course I still very much develop for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, and in the back of my mind I want to loop back around to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; (it's my main writing environment), and then I have another product I call Belter I want to finish. And I wouldn't mind trying to make a CSS thing that makes more sense than the tragedy CSS is, and also would love to see a port of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; to Linux, though I don't see doing that myself, but I would like to guide it (so it runs all the old stuff first). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just spent a few minutes with &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.ai/&quot;&gt;meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook's answer to ChatGPT, and it's really good. The drawing functionality recalcs while you're entering the prompt, so if you type, &quot;vary gender, age and race,&quot; and as you type each word, the image changes.</description>

And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't.

I had forgotten this. That's how long it's been that he's wanted to hook WP up to the social web. It doesn't look like I posted that to Scripting News. I wonder what other nuggets of forgotten history I'll find there.</description>

			<title>Working together</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Each form of online discussion has a &lt;i&gt;grain&lt;/i&gt; to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt; and I used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about how something &quot;follows the grain of the web.&quot; Twitter has its own grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie number of followers in both directions). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I made a list of some of the social networks I've been on starting in the mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own limits, rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of relationships between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction always flame out. It's hard to get people to read your blog. If you make it easier it changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok form hierarchies of influencers. I think of those as the networks &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; covers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there isn't a structure that I'm aware of that leads to people working together. It's a puzzle I keep trying to figure out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; to survive climate change and fascism. It would be good to crack this nut. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it's always up for working with you. The critics of AI don't begin to understand this. As an example, I'm going to ask ChatGPT to draw a picture of people working together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png&quot;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't have to wait. It didn't look at my follower count, or my bank statement to decide if it was willing to work with me. I pay the $20 a month, and I've got a persistent always-on collaborator. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun&quot;&gt;with palafo&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-laforge&quot;&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;) on Threads. It's remarkable. We actually did some work together. No sarcasm. It may be hard to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; but if you're curious about collaborative systems, here's a real example. Serendipitous, unplanned, but we figured something out by combining our experiences. Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/&quot;&gt;Ben Werdmuller&lt;/a&gt;, a person who I've gotten to know recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He asked one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;, how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to laugh. I had an idea and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; it. (This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1v5hy6/how_does_the_snl_audience_know_when_to_laugh/&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/463e08c0-0380-4e65-9e6c-2742ce91f0db&quot;&gt;checked&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you take away one thing from this post it's that we can collaborate with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be thinking about the machines the wrong way. Maybe they're the most human thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, somewhat like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPDUpjkHg0&quot;&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/cleaningAMess.png&quot;&gt;humans working together&lt;/a&gt; to clean up a mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Yesterday I gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://john.onolan.org/&quot;&gt;John O'Nolan&lt;/a&gt; what I think is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C5y7iVoJP4r&quot;&gt;good idea&lt;/a&gt; for getting his Ghost blogs federating with Threads, Mastodon et al. I didn't expect thanks or even a response, but I wonder if he even heard it. Most of the time, trying to help other people results in not even an acknowledgment that they saw it. If I were him I'd look for a painless, quick way to get maximum interop. Something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.social/&quot;&gt;ghost.social&lt;/a&gt;. I'd give the same advice to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; at Automattic (in fact I think I did). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I think acknowledgment is a key part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; on the web. Nothing more than &quot;I wanted you to know I saw it&quot; is often all that's needed to grease the skids of discourse. I've had a friendly disagreement with Manton at micro.blog about this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A blogroll on a Drummer blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;How to add a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;FeedLand blogroll&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;Drummer blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can specify that all the feeds you're subscribed to are in your blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in the blogroll. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new post, it goes to the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the pubdate to go to the full item on the web. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the list, Return to expand/collapse. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're working on WordPress plugin. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blogrollUsername -- required&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blogrollServer -- optional, if not specified it's feedland.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blogrollCategory -- optional&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blogrollTitle -- optional, but you really should provide a title, otherwise we invent a silly one for you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/15/headlevelatts.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of how the head-level attributes are set on &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/bullmancuso@gmail.com/&quot;&gt;Bull Mancuso's blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/15/bullblogscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the blog itself with the blogroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A link to Bull's blogroll &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?username=bullmancuso&amp;catname=blogroll&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; on feedland.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/303&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to ask questions offer kudos, etc. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up and document the WordPress plugin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.</description>

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.</description>

			<title>It's bigger than a tiny little textbox</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Question: What's between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/14/tinylittletextboxexample.png&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt; and a full-blown content management system?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Answer: A full-featured text editor with a social media feel to it without the limits of twitter-like systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is for, to identity the essential features. This editor supports them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;100% built on WordPress. Why reinvent all the good stuff that's been debugged and scaled and has all that support in the world. As I like to say, one way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/13/biggerThanATinyLittleTextbox.m4a&quot;&gt;seven-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; that explains.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: And don't forget about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social&quot;&gt;the blogroll&lt;/a&gt;. It's part of the puzzle too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: The house was really cold when I did this recording so I walked around to try to stay warm. By the end I was pretty close to shivering out loud. I turned the heat up after I finished. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/13/whatsBetween.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The question we intend to answer. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There was very little to laugh about in this new version, but omg it is such a beautifully presented story. Even if you hated the plot you'd have to watch it just to see the art. And if you're Italian or love Italy, you have to watch it. Anyway now that I know all the twists and how it ends, I'm going to have to watch it again, but I might wait to recover from the experience. It is, at times, hard to watch. But oh so goooood.</description>

			<source:outline text="I just finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix, an 8-part miniseries remake of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talented_Mr._Ripley_(film)&quot;&gt;The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, which I remember, probably incorrectly, as a light-hearted story. There was very little to laugh about in this new version, but omg it is such a beautifully presented story. Even if you hated the plot you'd have to watch it just to see the art. And if you're Italian or love Italy, you have to watch it. Anyway now that I know all the twists and how it ends, I'm going to have to watch it again, but I might wait to recover from the experience.

			<title>My 1988 driver's license</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Found this in my desk drawer today. Amazing the things you carry with you over the ages. I lived in an apartment building on top of a hill in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/1100+Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.424696,-122.2298177,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fa4f7ba716f5d:0x4318060066990628!8m2!3d37.4247727!4d-122.2181447!16s%2Fg%2F11c1343h_f?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;middle of a golf course&lt;/a&gt;, smack in the heart of Silicon Valley, if it actually had a heart, and that's debatable. All the Sand Hill Road VCs were on the other side of the hill. And one exit south on 280 was Xerox PARC, and where NeXT had its startup offices. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/11/driverslicensesmall1988.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;My 1988 driver's license.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the place where I started development of what became &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. I always wanted to do a great system level scripting thing, based on what I learned from Unix and what I loved about the graphic user interface. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It became a lot bigger than I anticipated. In the beginning it was meant to be a replacement for the Macintosh Finder, with an outliner for a file system browser, and of course a fantastic scripting ability, of the OS and of scriptable apps. I wish Apple had supported this effort but I didn't understand at the time that they couldn't. They weren't set up to let anyone but Bill and Andy make great products, even if their products weren't all that great, imho of course. You have to live with the mythology you create. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people got their first programming experience with Hypercard. I would have loved if more of them get their first experience with Frontier. Even better would have been if our products worked together, but that wasn't in the cards either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Me and FSD</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html&quot;&gt;political preamble&lt;/a&gt; on Tesla, X and Musk. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more disclaimer: I love my Tesla Model Y. Best car ever. I've been driving a Tesla since late 2021, and I still feel privileged to drive the car every time I do. It's the Macintosh of cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't generally use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html&quot;&gt;FSD&lt;/a&gt;, even though I paid for it and have had it available all the time I've driven a Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They say you should always be fully attentive when using FSD. I am always &lt;i&gt;soooo&lt;/i&gt; ready to take over for it. I don't trust it. And I also don't feel that when I'm in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-knuckle&quot;&gt;white-knuckle&lt;/a&gt; mode when it's driving, that my reflexes are anywhere near as good as the reflexes I have when I'm driving, with fifty years of experience, and maybe a few hours of experience supervising a FSD car. I don't have a sense of how to work with it. So I err on the side of turning it off whenever I feel like even slightly scared. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I also don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster&quot;&gt;roller coasters&lt;/a&gt;, but if I did, I'd recognize that this is different. A roller coaster is designed to give the exact same experience to every user every time. It's designed to give the impression that your life is about to end, using gravity and eyesight and all that evolution trained you to be scared of. It fools you into being scared, when you're actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a rollercoaster. That probably improves the fun for thrill-seekers, and gives people like me justification for staying away.

First I was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_28&quot;&gt;Route 28&lt;/a&gt;, a four-lane road, for about five miles, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9972259,-74.1046808,3a,75y,343.4h,68.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srkTm7bYH3qW0CqLfUyT18w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; onto &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_375&quot;&gt;375&lt;/a&gt; which is a curvy two-lane road. I was starting to feel slightly comfortable. Then we come up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_212&quot;&gt;212&lt;/a&gt;, where 375 ends. A busy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@42.0369198,-74.1109242,3a,75y,19.14h,83.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJbEh3c4hgugNZsCx4uUtZw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;intersection&lt;/a&gt;. Traffic coming from the left and right, and many are turning onto the road I'm on. I watched in awe as FSD tried to find a way to make a left turn in this complicated situation, starting, stopping, it tried, found itself out in traffic, and got stuck there. I had enough and took over. Luckily the car waiting behind us had left a little room. I've dealt with this intersection probably a few hundred times in the last few years. I know the crazy things the other drivers do here, and I know to watch out for them. The Tesla didn't know.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It fools you into being scared, when you're actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a rollercoaster.

The things that matter happen far away from her conferences and dinners. It's as if Silicon Valley were Hollywood. To some people it is.

			<title>On Tesla, Nazis, X and the Macintosh of cars</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'd buy a Tesla today because of Musk's politics which he puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of people dying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who developed it, who I don't know. I hope they're not Nazis. I don't see how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the year I bought mine, could be anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be hard for me to do. I don't think my &quot;support&quot; of Tesla could mean that much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car (one of its innovations). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It's like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even if I wasn't one of Apple's top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs didn't design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did. Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial. That's a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don't want these products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those are some of the brightest people out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I'm looking at other company's EVs with lust. I might like a Kia or a BMW. If you're making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/&quot;&gt;Ben Wurdmuller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/2024/i-tried-tesla-fsd&quot;&gt;posted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.

This piece started out to be about FSD, but the preamble, like the one in his piece, got so long I decided to post it first as its own piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Something disturbing about America in 2024. Over a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/&quot;&gt;million&lt;/a&gt; Americans died of Covid, but they aren’t on our minds. A million more have long Covid, perhaps. This suggests a million Americans could be killed by our government in the name of a conspiracy, and we’d shrug it off like good Germans. “We didn’t know,” a likely defense.</description>

			<title>How my workday flows</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;On Bluesky, Andrew Hickey &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the chaos. It wasn't until the work was over that I was able to start to get back into my flow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a good five or six hours before it's time to do the next thing.  The first hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about where I'm going next. By hour two, I'm not quite at my highest rate but getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I'm in a good groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I'm taking short breaks to check email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my attention to be available, for a short period.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After 5-6 hours of this, I'm wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my head. It doesn't take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole thing, and basically have to start over the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I'm sure of it. Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual achievement. If you're doing something that few other people do well, you're not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and a lot of detail, and memory, but you're sometimes inventing things that no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other. And you're doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you're burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they don't interfere at all. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won't edit it until the evening, when I do lite work that doesn't require much focus for any duration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Different kinds of networks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and tries out new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;With ActivityPub you know who's following you and in RSS you don't. This may sound like a negative until you think about it from the user's standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn't like RSS btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind of spooky but I guess ok. I can't recall ever receiving spam as a result of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I unsub begging me to come back. So it isn't a huge problem in a real way at least for me, yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You're just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don't abide that. Have a nice day.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sometimes it pays to start over</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think you can save time by starting over sometimes, and rebuild the complexity, carefully testing at every step. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Going back and fixing a poorly tested corner-turn, esp one you did a while ago, is a time-consuming and frustrating process. You need to have a fully consistent model to evolve. When you try to reorganize a complicated bit of code, and you find yourself scratching your head about how this or that works, that's a sign that it &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it's much more fun to add new features to a broken foundation than it is to either fix the foundation or rip it out and put in a new one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
