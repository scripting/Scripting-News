			<description>Every year around this time I start thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Blogger+Of+The+Year%22&quot;&gt;Blogger Of The Year&lt;/a&gt;. And there's no doubt who it will be this year, but no spoilers. Also around this time each year we start thinking about which movies will be in this year's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+njff&quot;&gt;NakedJen Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, a tradition on Christmas Day every year when all the best pictures come out. Recent years the NJFF as its fans lovingly refer to it has been a virtual event, thanks to streaming, BitTorrent, COVID and the fact that Jen moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City&quot;&gt;SLC&lt;/a&gt;, though we have held them in realspace in NYC and SLC since then.</description>

			<description>Twitter &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/x-twitter-elon-musk-israel-hamas-gaza-misinformation-meta-threads.html?via=rss&quot;&gt;shell of its former self&lt;/a&gt;, I can see that in my own behavior. I used to help out voluntarily to vet posts their bots thought were questionable, but I don't do that any more. I don't feel any sense of ownership of Twitter. Looking back, it's surprising that I ever did. I also used to run polls there, but I don't do that any longer. And when something new is happening, I have no idea where to go, but I don't go to Twitter like I used to. These are facts. Not anything I ever weighed and &lt;i&gt;decided&lt;/i&gt; to stop doing, I just don't do them. And yes I think it's a good thing that the fog of Twitter is clearing. There was a time when I hoped interesting ideas would pop up in the blogosphere, but then we got lost in all the bullshit of Twitter, and now that's over. So maybe there's room for the web being used, once again, as a way of connecting real people in smaller numbers.</description>

A team of AI programmers can adapt a huge codebase to new incompatible APIs in an instant, where a system maintained by humans develops inertia quickly. The thought of re-doing a huge base of code that took years to assemble is impossible to contemplate. Human brains resist huge changes. Computers, on the other hand, now that they've learned how to program themselves, could obsolete all human programmers in an instant. Imagine turning an open ecosystem into a closed corporate-owned silo in an afternoon.  Imagine Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk wake up one morning in a bad mood. Or imagine the conversation between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4EfdnMZ5g&quot;&gt;HAL and Dave&lt;/a&gt;. It could be that every human-authored bit of code is already an artifact.</description>

			<description>Podcasting -- textcasting, artcasting, codecasting -- why should we only have tight standards for content in audio. Why not everything. Interestingly we're really close with art.

How much better our lives would have been if they had kept creating like the Rolling Stones have. Of course the Stones are the outliers, most of the great bands of the 60s and early 70s stopped creating a long time ago. Or at least that we're aware of. Anyway, I never really got it until I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/every-song-by-the-beatles-john-lennon-hated/&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; about the Beatles songs John Lennon hated. In that piece Harrison is quoted talking about how McCartney made them work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Silver_Hammer&quot;&gt;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&lt;/a&gt; for weeks. I mostly am with McCartney that there's nothing wrong with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_Love_Songs&quot;&gt;silly love songs&lt;/a&gt;, but I find MSH is hard to listen to. On the other hand, I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLRiGX3L-kw&quot;&gt;Lady Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/13.html#a220422&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the other day, even though his bandmates didn't seem to. And what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/why-dont-we-do-it-in-the-road/&quot;&gt;great story&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Don%27t_We_Do_It_in_the_Road%3F&quot;&gt;Why Don't We Do It In The Road&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

There's a new version of the server that handles &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/40&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;. This will be an important feature going forward. Right now what it needs most is testing and feedback. The user interface is very provisional.</description>

This has led to some very nice synergies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Example: A script you can add to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1627490175000&quot;&gt;Scripts menu&lt;/a&gt; that asks for the URL of a feed, and inserts a node into your outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var url = dialog.ask (&quot;URL of feed&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var theFeed = rss.readFeed (url)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.insert (theFeed.title)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.attributes.addGroup ({type: 'rss', xmlUrl: url})&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the DocServer pages&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=dialog.ask&quot;&gt;dialog.ask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=rss.readFeed&quot;&gt;rss.readFeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=op.insert&quot;&gt;op.insert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=op.attributes.addGroup&quot;&gt;op.attributes.addGroup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Took five minutes to write and worked the first time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The Nth statement doesn't start until the one before it completes. This version of JavaScript is optimized for the 99% of times you want synchronous code, makes that the default, as all reasonable languages do. Otherwise it's plain old JavaScript, which is a fine Algol-like language. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The verbs, dialog.ask, rss.readFeed, op.insert, op.attributes.addGroup, are designed to reduce complicated things to their most simple core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=rss.readFeed&quot;&gt;rss.readFeed&lt;/a&gt;, for example, builds on a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt; of understanding feed reading, parses all common formats that fit under the RSS umbrella and makes it all flat. Factoring is the antidote to chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And &quot;op&quot; stands for outline processor. Those verbs go back to the late 80s when they were the first verbs in my first language outliner I called Betty. Why change the name of verbs if they work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; that one way to do something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just listened to an hour of McCartney on Apple Music, and I love his stuff, but the best songs he did were collaborations with the rest of the band. No one of them had the magic, it was all of them. Take a minute and listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLRiGX3L-kw&quot;&gt;Lady Madonna&lt;/a&gt;. Lennon says &lt;a href=&quot;https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/every-song-by-the-beatles-john-lennon-hated/&quot;&gt;he didn't like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Madonna&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;, but I can hear him in it. It's got the edge that McCartney alone doesn't have. Compare it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdDPR8GzXy8&quot;&gt;Maybe I'm Amazed&lt;/a&gt;, the first song that the bot picked. It's like listening to part of one channel of a Beatles song.</description>

It is not factoring if you replace a pattern with another equally complicated pattern. Factoring is why the software you make in 2023 should be more powerful than the software you did in 2013 and 2003. Factoring happens slowly, usually. Sometimes factoring happens in a moment, when you realize how to reduce something by making a small change somewhere else. &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/editThisPage&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; was one of those.</description>

			<description>A great example of factoring is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/a&gt; function in JavaScript. There was a pattern, a for loop that iterated over an array with an index. They took out the index and did the iterating for you. It's a small simplification, and I smile every time I use it because the got rid of a little drudge work for me when entering it and reading the code. In no way a big deal, but nice that they found a way to make things easier and faster. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/b0801e46-dc1d-436d-980e-cd23bd054a95&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; why forEach is so great, but they use other &quot;advances&quot; in JavaScript that I consider unnecessary, not useful, cryptic, and I don't use them.</description>

			<title>Why Mastodon isn't The One</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Take a break from your busy day and &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/subToProPublica.png&quot;&gt;study this picture&lt;/a&gt;. It's why Mastodon as a federated system is not going to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I decided to follow ProPublica.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I clicked on the &lt;i&gt;Follow&lt;/i&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/subToProPublica.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; showed up with a very complicated set of instructions. It requires me to remember an address that I do not remember. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Instead of following, I wrote this blog post, because it was simpler to do this and I'm tired of people ignoring this because I care about us getting this right. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why will it never work? Why is Mastodon &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; The One? I know, because I thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; should do what Twitter ended up doing and the main reason that happened is that to follow someone in Twitter is one click, and you're done, and I don't even want to write down the process for feeds because it's even worse than what it is in Mastodon today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/frankfurter.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Not that we didn't know this at the time, we did, or how to solve it at a technical level. I tried to get everyone to work with us on making subscription simple, but it didn't happen. Later I came to believe it couldn't. We &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; force everyone to use the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;export format&lt;/a&gt;, that worked incredibly well. But every RSS reader developer acted as if they were the only product that did what they did and didn't want to do anything they didn't have to to make it easy for people to subscribe in other reader software. It's so convoluted and stupid, you have to figure the people making the actual decisions had never used an RSS reader and never wanted to subscribe to a feed. This, btw, is pretty common in the tech industry, product ignorance among key decision-makers. I even heard a CEO once boast that he didn't need to use the product because he's a 'market of one' as if all his customers were frankfurter &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstituted_meat&quot;&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the bottom line. If subscription isn't one-click in your federated social media system, go back to the drawing board and re-do your architecture, because it won't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: After writing the post I was calmer and remembered where my account was, and it was two steps from there to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsie.social/@ProPublica&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

My answer: Assume until proven otherwise that everyone is out to advance only themself. Unless you can see actual things they've done that were for the good of others or everyone, don't believe their claims. I didn't start out this way, quite the opposite, I thought everyone wanted to do good stuff that makes the world better. We certainly need a lot more of that. But being in it for yourself is a survival trait I guess, and until we reinvent evolution to select for group-good, we're more or less permanently fucked. At the slightest sign of progress, some asshole will try to take the common good for themselves. A great example is how Big Tech has taken over the open web and is gradually turning it into a cash cow for themselves.</description>

			<title>ActivityPub?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's been some recent discussion about whether ActivityPub is the standard everyone should be building on, and that new ways of social networking, or even previously existing ones, should stop and implement ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My answer is this -- if ActivityPub were sufficient, I'd say yes -- let's coalesce around one standard, and stop trying to make something slightly better. I have a motto that goes with this -- One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. For a couple of reasons: 1. You still have to support both, so you just made everyone's life more complicated, assuming the second way gains traction. 2. The goal is interop, not creating standards. Both of these are part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But honestly, ActivityPub is both insufficient and a mess. And I'm not even convinced that what it's doing is all that worthwhile. I don't see conversation on social nets as having much value. Replies to my posts tend to be spam, people looking for exposure, hitching a ride on a post that's getting some flow, or to be annoying. It's very rare that new ideas or information come to light this way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And all the arguing in the world won't change the way things are going. ActivityPub isn't the standard. People want to be Mastodon-compatible, not ActivityPub-compatible. Much of what Mastodon is doing isn't part of ActivityPub, it's their own API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen it said that Atom was a good thing, that somehow &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; wasn't enough. And all the &quot;IndieWeb&quot; protocols that just reinvent the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt;. Depends what your goals were. If you were intending to keep RSS and the blogging APIs from growing, then they were great successes. People spent time judging not aiming for more interop, whether items had their proper names, which is a common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution_(biology)&quot;&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt; in this kind of work, they even have a name for it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality&quot;&gt;bike-shedding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's better to reduce the number of competing formats than to increase the number. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Again all that matters is interop, and splitting an open standard into multiple competing standards works &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to ActivityPub. I wish it were simpler, that you could get something interesting working quickly that delivers interop. But it isn't that way, and no one seems interested in making it so. So imho the world will not coalesce behind ActivityPub, I wish it could, but it can't and won't happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>One reason I miss Frontier</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/26/frontier.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Quick note -- I'm working on a deep database feature in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, adding support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22reading+lists%22&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the sense that it's under several layers of user interface. It's like digging up the foundation of a house and figuring out how to add a new room on the third floor. It's something of a high wire act, but I honestly think I figured it out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's far from the first time I've implemented reading lists, I've done it before with simpler apps in JavaScript, and richer apps many years ago, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This time it's in JavaScript and MySQL, and thus is, in one way, fairly compariable to UserTalk and Frontier's object database. But we didn't have the SQL querying capability in Frontier, so it's not comparable in that way. What we're doing now in FeedLand would not have been possible in Frontier.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To implement this feature in MySQL I needed two tables to the database, one for reading lists, and the other for reading list subscriptions. This part is very easy. Not necessary in Frontier's object database because the structure is ad hoc, like JavaScript objects are ad hoc. You could store relational database tables in a JS object, but there would be nothing to prevent you from breaking the rules in some or all of the &quot;records.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where it gets complicated is the code to access the database, and use the reading lists while everything is running. The Frontier code to implement the structures would also be simple, and easy to debug. It's just straight line code, with if's and else's. The runtime takes care of suspending your thread when you need to wait for a result, it does not show up in the syntax of the language. The Frontier programming language also has an intimate relationship with its database, whereas in JavaScript and MySQL there are layers of levels between the JS stack and the database. There really don't need to be any layers at all, that's what Frontier proves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It took me years to dig out from under all the layers and gruntwork that's here that wasn't in Frontier to figure out what exactly the difference was.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And since I designed Frontier, this is self-praise, for which I apologize, but let me share with you the secret that makes Frontier so much better. For years in development I factored and refactored every time I came up with a simpler way to do something. I had been programming for a decade when I started Frontier, and had used some great highly factored tools before -- specifically Unix and THINK C, and I understood the process, having done it with commercial Mac, IBM and Apple II end-user products. I treated every aspect of development as you would treat the user experience of end-user software. And since you are an intimately involved user, there's a huge advantage here. I just had the time, and took the time to do the factoring that so far no one else has taken. At least to my knowledge and that's a big caveat because we don't generally use each others' platforms in tech, unlike other arts and sciences, we tend to live in and create our own caves. But Frontier was a product at one point, with several thousand people working in it, and most of them understand what I'm talking about here .&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/105ed538-237d-4e52-862e-a876ffb2575e&quot;&gt;five distinguishing features&lt;/a&gt; of Frontier.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It just occurred to me that one way to emerge from it before it's too late is if a few Congressional Republicans took the Dems up on their offer to collaborate on choosing the next Speaker. Because enough come from majority Democratic districts, it might just get them re-elected next year. If they go the other way and support a Republican that's catering to the eight insane House members, the depression will continue unabated for more months or years. When you see an opening, first you have to actually see it.</description>

			<description>Interesting perspective shift. I saw there's a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.bcs.org/store/221/detail/workgroup?id=3-221-9781780176413&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pesce&quot;&gt;Mark Pesce&lt;/a&gt; about AI systems, and it gets pretty technical. I was surprised because I thought he was a pundit (which he is) but unlike most tech pundits, he also knows how to program. More than that. I remember the first time I had a real talk with a famous tech pundit in the 80s and was shocked that he knew nothing about the ones and zeros. Didn't these people at least take &lt;a href=&quot;https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science&quot;&gt;Intro to Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; in college? Shouldn't that be a basic prerequesite for selling one's opinions about tech? Now many years later I'm surprised to see one that does.</description>

			<description>At the same time, I've been programming for &lt;i&gt;fifty years&lt;/i&gt; as of this year. I started programming at 18 as a student at Tulane University. A math major who decided to give computers a try because &quot;I heard you can make money doing that.&quot; Fifty years might be some kind of record too. All through my career, going back to my mid-30s, people have written me off as too old to develop software. I always resisted this, and resented people playing that trick. It wasn't true in my 30s or 40s or 50s, or even 60s, but I can see a day when it will be true. Programming depends on human memory. Over time the machine you're building on becomes more complex, the interconnections between the components become harder to grok, and you often don't remember why you did this or that. You resist making changes that could bring the whole thing down. So evolution of software becomes slower. There is a reason you can't keep pitching in baseball, or being a basketball star after 40. In software the time barrier is higher, but it is there, I can feel it.</description>

			<description>I was talking with some friends the other day about what a project to restore the early blogosphere might be like. Off the top of my head I thought of several sites I'd want to be sure were restored in their original condition and location. First, Jorn Barger's Robot Wisdom, Evan Williams' Evhead and Justin Hall's Links.net. I'd also go for Blogtree, which was an innovative and fascinating effort to create basically a family tree of early blogs. I'd approach it like an archeologist. Some of the originals aren't with us any longer, some that never got the notoriety that they deserved imho, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle&quot;&gt;Jerry Pournelle&lt;/a&gt;, who greatly influenced me as an observer of tech. I'd love to see the earliest posts on Mike Arrington's TechCrunch, another important blog that had enormous influence. Doc Searls, the Cluetrain, Kottke, Meghead, I know there are whole universes of blogging that I don't know anything about, it grew so large so quickly. And it was very gratifying to see the Harvard blogs mostly restored. There was a lot of stuff that didn't make the first cut. But it set me thinking about what we could do if we really worked at it and what that might mean for creating more persistent writing on the web for the present and future.</description>

			<source:outline text="I was talking with some friends the other day about what a project to restore the early blogosphere might be like. Off the top of my head I thought of several sites I'd want to be sure were restored in their original condition and location. First, Jorn Barger's Robot Wisdom, Evan Williams' Evhead and Justin Hall's Links.net. I'd also go for Blogtree, which was an innovative and fascinating effort to create basically a family tree of early blogs. I'd approach it like an archeologist. Some of the originals aren't with us any longer, some that never got the notoriety that they deserved imho, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle&quot;&gt;Jerry Pournelle&lt;/a&gt;, who greatly influenced me as an observer of tech. I'd love to see the earliest posts on Mike Arrington's TechCrunch, another important blog that had enormous influence. Doc Searls, the Cluetrain, Kottke, Meghead, I know there are whole universes of blogging that I don't know anything about, it grew so large so quickly. And it was very gratifying to see the Harvard blogs mostly restored. There was a lot of stuff that didn't make the first cut. But it set me thinking about what we could do if we really worked at it and what that might mean for creating more persistent writing on the web for the present and future." created="Sat, 07 Oct 2023 20:03:04 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/07.html#a200304"/>

			<description>Journalism could do some good by focusing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/45qulMJ&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; the House Dems are making to possibly persuadable Repubs. Treat it seriously. Ask Repubs what they think. I think there's still some amount of honor, if not in the representatives, in the people. With press air cover, people could call their reps, write op-eds and blog posts, picket, collect signatures. Protest. It's a good thing to discuss. When and if the political depression in America lifts, this is what what it will look like.</description>

For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y71iDvCYXA&quot;&gt;Pump It Up&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;i&gt;sooo&lt;/i&gt; perfect for Peloton. Oh my god.

			<title>Twitter never did links anyway</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/04/debbieDowner.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Today's debate is whether Elon Musk is out to strangle journalism by algorithmically downplaying links somehow. But that isn't what he said. What he actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; is that in Twitter people don't click on links. This is observable. I've known this for years as I tried to arrange it so people could read my blog posts where ever they wanted, and finally in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;gave up&lt;/a&gt; because it was impossible. Even if Twitter had completely dropped the character limit then, it still wouldn't have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why don't people click on links? Probably because the user experience is a nightmare. First you have to turn off your add blocker to even see the article, and then you have to subscribe to the pub to read this one article. So you hit the back button and if you're like me you remember never again to click on links in Twitter. That happened long before Musk arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also what Twitter does is not linking because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can't hot-up some text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can only link to one thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a very limited form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/4818e375-949d-4b7e-9686-4961f148ee32&quot;&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. But not like I do linking in a story like the one you're reading now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best thing one of these services could do to distinguish itself is to support Markdown, allow enclosures for podcasting, have outbound RSS feeds to start, and inbound feeds soon after, and optional titles. That's about it. Basic features of blogging software circa 1999 or so. But they don't want to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one that did so would be loved by writers, and if writers love it, it can't be long before readers love it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the feature that Twitter added in February, while it isn't the panacea that would allow Twitter to let me post my writing there, it is a big step forward. 4000 characters is a pretty useful possible length. And they did exactly what I said they should a decade or so ago with what I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;Fat Tweets&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't want to read the rest, after 280, don't click the freaking button. But when you do, you'll know:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No delay, the text is already there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No request to turn off ad blockers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No paywall.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sounds a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;like podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, you know Adam's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/the-last-yard-adam-curry&quot;&gt;Last Yard&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words you will be able to read what's there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a start. It's better than what was there before. An improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For me it totally justifies the $8 a month fee. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More features like that please.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: And yes Musk's politics are horrible, as are the politics of people who run a lot of companies whose products you use. But Musk's horribleness is in our faces. At some point Tesla and Starlink are going to suffer for it, as Twitter is now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in May 2017 when I decided finally to give up on trying to peer with social networks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've known this for years as I tried to arrange it so people could read my blog posts where ever they wanted, and finally in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;gave up&lt;/a&gt; because it was impossible. Even if Twitter had completely dropped the character limit then, it still wouldn't have been possible." created="Wed, 04 Oct 2023 16:44:45 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/04/debbieDowner.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/04.html#a164445"/>
				<source:outline text="Why don't people click on links? Probably because the user experience is a nightmare. First you have to turn off your add blocker to even see the article, and then you have to subscribe to the pub to read this one article. So you hit the back button and if you're like me you remember never again to click on links in Twitter. That happened long before Musk arrived." created="Wed, 04 Oct 2023 16:44:45 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/04.html#a164445"/>

				<source:outline text="But the feature that Twitter added in February, while it isn't the panacea that would allow Twitter to let me post my writing there, it is a big step forward. 4000 characters is a pretty useful possible length.
