An iPad was like a magazine, but what would you tell a young person who never used a magazine? What is it? Right now almost everyone is looking at AI from the point of view of a world with no AI. And it turns out that once you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start playing and you find all kinds of amazing things. But if you don't try it, you'll always be looking at it from the past. We've seen this kind of explosive growth in the power of the individual human. It's a 20-minute podcast and I'm all over the map, but it's good stuff, imho of course. YMMV, my mother loves me, I am not a lawyer.</description>

			<description>I found a fairly painless way to transcribe voicemails using Google Docs. 1. Open a text document. 2. Choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en&quot;&gt;Voice Typing&lt;/a&gt; from the Tools menu. 3. Play the voice memo over the speaker of your iPhone. 4. That's it. Google transcribes it into your document. It would be better if Apple offered that as an option in the Share menu, but they don't.</description>

			<title>Why Tesla FSD is unsafe</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Here's what I've learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla&quot;&gt;owing&lt;/a&gt; a Tesla Model Y with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html&quot;&gt;Full Self Driving&lt;/a&gt;. I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as &quot;self-driving,&quot; which it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9&quot;&gt;Kia EV9&lt;/a&gt;, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romeokia.com/&quot;&gt;Kia dealer&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York&quot;&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt; which is practically in the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A post I wrote on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext. Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. &quot;show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.&quot; Like that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.</description>

			<description>Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season&quot;&gt;starts all over again&lt;/a&gt;. With love for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&amp;t=315s&quot;&gt;heart of gold&lt;/a&gt; team. Either way we win, imho. I know you're not supposed to feel that way, but that's how I feel right now. During the game, if we're losing, based on recent experience I won't like that so much. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>This blog is becoming a ChatGPT blog the same way when it started it was all about the web. I'd love to get pointers to other blogs whose content is largely about ChatGPT, so we can systematize learning about what we all are discovering. I think that blogs and ChatGPT are going to go together just like Google search and blogs did when search was booting up. Bloggers (not all of us, but some) provide good material for bootstraps. We just need to hook up blogs to social web, which is what I'm working on this year.</description>

			<description>Just tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/&quot;&gt;perplexity.ai&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Everyone's been raving about it. I asked it a question I asked ChatGPT in working on the RSS feeds for my current project. &quot;Suppose I had an RSS feed for a WordPress blog, and I wanted to include the id's of the site and post in the &amp;lt;item&gt; for each post. Is there a standard way to do this? If not, is there a namespace defined for WordPress blogs that might provide some prior art?&quot; Both were able to get me all the info I wanted, and answered follow-up questions. Perplexity got there sooner. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/search/suppose-i-had-axAhbuSgS2mD_JSQcj9qLA&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>A few weeks ago I asked ChatGPT if it could transcribe an M4A audio file, the kind of file that Apple's voice memo app produces, and it said no, it couldn't do that. I gave it another try today and got a different answer. I uploaded the file, and it came close, it said it needed the file in WAV format. It gave me instructions for writing a desktop tool that would do the conversion. I expect in another couple of weeks they'll be able to deal with the M4A file directly.</description>

			<description>I think it would be really cool to have the voice interface for ChatGPT available on Amazon Echo. I kind of doubt that Amazon would want to do that. Alexa is nice, but really weak compared to ChatGPT.</description>

			<description>Do people understand the impact ChatGPT can have on how we control our software? No more hunting through menus among a thousand options to figure out how to do something. Just use natural human language. The UIs we've had to design and live with will be a thing of the past. Yet no one seems to be talking about this. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/9fe427a0-43b4-4f34-a830-39fdb4cdba37&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I've been trying to get transcripts of my voicemail, as easily as possible. In that example, it shows me how to do a variety of things. I kept asking if it could do it for me, all the way up to making a feature request of the developers at OpenAI. At some point they'll be able to add an item to my calendar, or make a feature request for me. That's the whole point of computers. They can do things for you.

			<description>Most of the news stories about AI are bullshit by people who clearly have not attempted to understand what its capabilities are. This is the real thing folks. Amazing breakthroughs are happening every freaking day. So much improvement and so much potential. How do I know, because in comments on social media, people parrot the bullshit, like they always do. Journalism is still hugely influential, and they are dishonest, lazy, self-interested bordering on narcissism, and very very dangerous. We need to re-form journalism as if our continued existence depends on it.</description>

			<title>Knicks update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: For the 80,000th time -- the Knicks suck!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;All the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html&quot;&gt;funny farting&lt;/a&gt; didn't make a difference last night. The Knicks were &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-playoffs-pacers-lock-down-knicks-to-force-game-7-030512562.html&quot;&gt;blown out&lt;/a&gt;, again (sigh), by the Indiana team. My dear friend NakedJen texted me from Oklahoma of all places (I don't know how she got there, or why, she must be on her way to some other place, maybe Dallas?) that the Knicks are trying to kill her. Sums it up perfectly. I gave myself leave after the first few minutes of the fourth quarter, seeing where this thing was going. I went to bed, and knew that when I woke up there would be a Game 7 at the Garden on Sunday (3:30PM Eastern). I'm not sure how I feel about that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The odds are probably pretty good that the Knicks will win that game, but maybe they should just let it go, and we can pick this up again in October. By then all the injured players should be back, and maybe there will be an incredible new free agent signed over the summer, so we're not so dependent on one superstar, who is great, but has off nights, like last night. Why didn't he let any other Knicks try to fill in for him, when he's double teamed that means someone is open. I was screaming at the TV during the game, let someone someone else shoot dammit! Oh my gods. I hate game 7's when my team is in the game. I don't mind it if other people's teams are in a death match like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if there was a social web toolkit with the basic building blocks so we could experiment with different UI and behaviors. Why, after so many years are we still so controlled. When and why did we give up?</description>

How incredibly insulting. It's just like what Trump says about Jewish Americans being loyal to Israel. Such an un-American idea. We all got here different ways. Some for a better life, some for life at all, others as slaves. But the United States is a big-hearted idea -- the &lt;i&gt;United&lt;/i&gt; States. It's unfortunate that such a small-minded &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;united person is so powerful now. We still have a long way to go.</description>

			<description>Here's something that matters. Somehow ChatGPT gets the story right about my various contributions. You'll see all kinds of BS in Wikipedia and other various highly rated sites. Somehow ChatGPT sees through the bullshit, and usually gets the story right. So when people say that human reporting is better than machine reporting, I think this may be one of those cases where conventional wisdom is wrong. The human record is relatively easy to manipulate if the researchers are lazy and/or dishonest.</description>

			<title>Google and The Innovator's Dilemma in 2024</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's overwhelming how much ground Google has to cover to get AI into all their products, but that's what they think they have to do, and I more or less agree. They feel they have to because their main product, search, is threatened by ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/17/innovatorsDilemma.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/5ab4f305-0d0d-4cba-b7d7-0b5debf06a6c&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma&quot;&gt;Innovator's Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;  in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation-dp-1633691780/dp/1633691780/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; published in 1997. It's why Netscape was able to undermine Microsoft when the web came out. Microsoft had a huge beast they had to move, Windows, and all its apps, and while they had a hardcore, scrappy and rich culture, they couldn't overcome the inertia that comes from being dug in, with their cannons pointed at the already-vanquished IBM, not the upstarts that came from the VCs in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and the rest of the PC industry had written off Unix, but there it was, again -- ugly as ever, but with networking that really worked and was easy, and the users wanted networking even though Microsoft wanted them to want Office. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google did the same with AI. As did Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. They had AI projects, and used AI in limited areas, as did Microsoft with Unix in the early 90s. But they couldn't bet everyting on it like a startup can. Now they have to. But the they don't have the tools needed to fight the new war. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; the dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the toughest corner any tech company has to turn, but there is an approach that could work for Google. Their strength is distribution. They have all the users. They can take a product that's ready for the world to market in a day. But they can't develop it. You can't snap your fingers and have a good new UI for every one of their products, ready in a year, although they will try as MS tried to adapt Office to the web. They don't have the right people or corporate culture to do that. Instead you have to hope you can find a great bootstrapping startup outside to work with, and use their strength as a distributor to help them. This is what I recommended for Microsoft in the 1990s, and I think I was vindicated, it would have imho worked a lot better than the path they chose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But now, their third time around this loop, Microsoft has learned! With their OpenAI partnership they've done exactly what I recommended in the 90s. They still have to convert all the old software and their user interfaces around the new capabilities, but at least they also own a share of a bootstrap that's now booming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I am blessed to have lived long enough now to have been part of now six different rearrangements like this. I love that we have now gotten there again. There's absolutely no doubt now, imho. The six rearrangements -- minis, PCs, GUIs, web, Napster, and now AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is all my opinion, and from the polls I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/16.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, it's obvious that many of the people within earshot don't agree or have seen the light yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The thing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;Casey Newton predicts&lt;/a&gt; for Google and news has already happened for the huge base of reference info and know-how for software development. We no longer go to the sources, don't need to, the ChatGPT version is an order of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into the AI database. We're going somewhere here. It's worth going there, imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the now and near-future. But it's as big a step as the move to PCs, then GUIs, the web, mobile.</description>

I'd like to create a notebook of info I'd like it to have available for people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that sometimes don't make it into the docs. But when I'm working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine, my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow pre-digest it.

			<source:outline text="Something I'd like from ChatGPT or a plug-in. I'd like to create a notebook of info I'd like it to have available for people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that sometimes don't make it into the docs. But when I'm working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine, my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow pre-digest it.

I'm discovering new significance for it every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be simple from the user's point of view, and in order for it to work technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It's a tall order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I'm confident I've covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press release? If you want to understand a new technology, don't talk to the CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are whirlwinds, they don't have time or the capacity to understand how big the idea is, they just know that it is big. If you want to understand you have to use it and you have to talk with other users.</description>

I really did want to know what happens if Trump is found guilty and sentenced to prison. I still do. But I don't think I'm going to turn off my ad blocker. I'll think about it. In the meantime if they had let me pay them $0.50 to read the freaking article, I might have linkblogged it to people who follow me via RSS or email, or on Bluesky or Mastodon, thus giving them a chance to sell others on paying $0.50 to read the freaking article. Not promising I'd do that, but if they really answer the question, if I really learn something I certainly would pass it along. Come on USA Today, get conscious. We'll happily support you for giving us info we wanted, just let us actually help you in a meaningful way, not by penalizing us for having the audacity to use an ad blocker.</description>

			<description>Yesterday's OpenAI big press event was a nothing burger. I thought they already had all of that stuff, they certainly had been at least telegraphing it. Also there never will be another Steve Jobs, it's too bad everyone is using his template for product announcements. It only works if you're Steve Jobs.</description>

			<description>BTW, I've been to three &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote&quot;&gt;Stevenotes&lt;/a&gt;, the first one, the rollout of the Mac  in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in 1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.</description>

I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where &quot;future&quot; is less than a year away.</description>

			<title>Brunson as bad man or decoy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/14/brunson.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson&quot;&gt;Jalen Brunson&lt;/a&gt;, Knicks star, after having his ass kicked in Sunday's game. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season&quot;&gt;bench players&lt;/a&gt;, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
