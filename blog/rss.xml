			<description>Here's a problem I have with the ChatGPT app. I can't find the conversations I had with it a month ago. And I need to. They desperately need a Bookmarks menu. I'm sure their corporate customers are screaming about this, because they need groupware too. Are they partnering with Slack, or is Slack doing their own, for example?</description>

			<description>Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc should collaborate on new ways to do software docs and user interaction using AI. It's an incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are to people, and the only people whose writing is ingested are employees of the companies. Not only will it increase utility, it will demonstrate in a very observable way how transformational the technology is. Probably will do nice things for the value of the stock too.</description>

			<description>The best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug&quot;&gt;campaign commercial&lt;/a&gt; ever. So simple. A nostalgic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_(Simon_%26_Garfunkel_song)&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, beautifully performed. Stock footage of American workers and families, interspersed with video from campaign events. These things aren't complicated. I bet Bernie and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel&quot;&gt;S&amp;G&lt;/a&gt; would let Biden use the same format.</description>

Every day I'm trying to do it myself and encourage others to as well. Explain things we can do now that weren't approachable before. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/25/howIUsedChatGptThisMorning.m4a&quot;&gt;15 minute report&lt;/a&gt; about this just now. I had to debug a complicated new configuration, setting up a new server with new code on both ends to implement a secure websocket connection. I've done it a dozen times, and you always make at least one mistake, and have to find it, and you need a checklist to go through, systematically, to find the problem, and it's really cool that ChatGPT can synthesize the checklist and give you instructions on tools that make it easy. There could never be anything like this on a Google/Stack Exchange type support system. It simply wasn't possible a year ago. We really need this story to get out too, but now it's all about how AI is a hoax. It is not. Yes Silicon Valley is run by monsters, doing basically the best they can. Riding a wave like this is thrilling but also you can't win on a personal level these days. It used to be the other way, you couldn't lose. They put the czars of tech on the covers of magazines and praised them as genius, godlike humans living at a much more elevated level than all of us schnooks, if you were one of the blessed. And always ignored are &lt;i&gt;the freaking users,&lt;/i&gt; which is where the actual revolution is taking place. Too much work for the journalists, I guess? I would think if you were reporting in a time when new uses of technology are being discovered daily, real ones, transformative ones, you'd want to be in on that story. Nope I guess you don't get a Pulitzer these days for reporting news, just for finding hypocrisy, which is always in great supply, real or imagined. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>As you may know, over the years I extend &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; by adding elements to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1716308936000&quot;&gt;source:self&lt;/a&gt; whose value is the canonical URL for the feed. This was a useful addition in Atom, which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md#61522-by-dw----v049&quot;&gt;supported&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/README.md&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, and I wanted to include the value without having to add another namespace to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt; and feeds produced by my products, so reallySimple now supports both. Small move forward for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>There's this great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mzY1sdiFSU&amp;t=53s&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; in MoneyBall where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane&quot;&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/a&gt; is talking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Justice&quot;&gt;David Justice&lt;/a&gt; in the batting cage. Justice reminds Beane how much he's paying him, and Beane says I'm going to tell it to you straight -- half your salary is being paid by the Yankees. Think about it. They're paying all that money for you to play &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; them. That's how I feel about Fox. How much will it cost to get them to STFU. Whatever it is it's worth it.</description>

			<description>If you're part of the indieweb community and work in Node.js, you should know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple package&lt;/a&gt;. It flattens the interface for the most common feed formats. It's designed to be super easy to use. Give it a URL and it returns a consistent JSON structure. More people would develop feed-using apps if they knew about this package. I just want more people to develop around feeds.</description>

I thought for sure as soon as the ideas were out they'd take off. But most people had no idea. Most big new ideas come out of developers realizing something new is possible, shipping it, refining it and getting lucky. AI is the next one, I'm absolutely sure of it. But most people, even most developers, don't see the need, don't see it as inevitable in a good way. To make a fine point, we don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; AI, we didn't need PCs or GUIs or the web. But once the masses saw the power, fun and utility, there was no turning back. The same is true of AI. I've been trying to puzzle out how this will go. How can we develop the amazing power and depth of knowledge of the machine combined with the creativity and deep yearning of humans. One thing I've learned from the year I've been doing this as a user, the machine doesn't want to do anything. Don't anthropomorphize it that way. Try having a conversation with it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/cb9c4c97-bb20-439e-a503-ed2356403b0c&quot;&gt;ask what it wants&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't understand the concept. It's not surprising that we think the machine will be like us, we always want something, we're the most selfish species there is. But we'll learn to work with the machine, I already have. We'll &lt;i&gt;evolve&lt;/i&gt; through this. That's maybe the biggest strength our species has, the rate at which we can adapt.</description>

			<source:outline text="No one was asking for the PCs, GUIs, the web, blogging or podcasting. I thought for sure as soon as the ideas were out they'd take off. But most people had no idea. Most big new ideas come out of developers realizing something new is possible, shipping it, refining it and getting lucky. AI is the next one, I'm absolutely sure of it. But most people, even most developers, don't see the need, don't see it as inevitable in a good way. To make a fine point, we don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; AI, we didn't need PCs or GUIs or the web. But once the masses saw the power, fun and utility, there was no turning back. The same is true of AI. I've been trying to puzzle out how this will go. How can we develop the amazing power and depth of knowledge of the machine combined with the creativity and deep yearning of humans. One thing I've learned from the year I've been doing this as a user, the machine doesn't want to do anything. Don't anthropomorphize it that way.

However, as always the most interesting stuff is done by the users, especially at such an early stage in a technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past, when blogging was booting up, we had blogging itself to share information about what we were learning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcasting grew even more quickly because we already had blogging to share info on what we were trying, what worked, and what didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see all of it in the archive of Scripting News. I was liberal about what I pointed to, because sharing the ideas was more important than any one person's ideas, including my own. The downside is that it made it easy for people to claim credit for things they didn't contribute. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway with AI, I'm just using the stuff, not developing with it, at least not yet. I wouldn't know where to begin. But I'm discovering all kinds of applications every day, and writing about them on my blog, but I know there are many others doing the same, and I want to read all of it and want them to read my stuff. There's no way to find each other right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: It would be interesting to have an AI server that was ingesting our RSS feeds all the time. Then a community of bloggers, if it should develop would have a totally unique kind of archive. Who knows what we'd learn? Would anyone need to write a book about this stuff, or would we always have a current book about what's been discovered here? If you find this fascinating as I do, then I want to know more about what you're doing. See how we can bootstrap something in itself, that's the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, when I discover a blogger who is writing about using AI, I'll add it to my blogroll, which is visible on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll.social&lt;/a&gt; main page, and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. If you have such a blog, or know of a good one, send me a link, and I'll add it to the blogroll. Once there are enough, I'll start a public timeline for it in FeedLand, so everyone can benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's use our technology to track the most exciting tech development in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

One of the major themes of the show is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.</description>

			<description>I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks. I knew all the players. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin&quot;&gt;Obi Toppin&lt;/a&gt;, a former Knick we traded for some reason. That's about it for my inner fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result when I got up in the morning. That's how I like my NBA, frankly.</description>

An iPad was like a magazine, but what would you tell a young person who never used a magazine? What is it? Right now almost everyone is looking at AI from the point of view of a world with no AI. And it turns out that once you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start playing and you find all kinds of amazing things. But if you don't try it, you'll always be looking at it from the past. We've seen this kind of explosive growth in the power of the individual human. It's a 20-minute podcast and I'm all over the map, but it's good stuff, imho of course.

			<description>I found a fairly painless way to transcribe voicemails using Google Docs. 1. Open a text document. 2. Choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en&quot;&gt;Voice Typing&lt;/a&gt; from the Tools menu. 3. Play the voice memo over the speaker of your iPhone. 4. That's it. Google transcribes it into your document. It would be better if Apple offered that as an option in the Share menu, but they don't.</description>

			<title>Why Tesla FSD is unsafe</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Here's what I've learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla&quot;&gt;owing&lt;/a&gt; a Tesla Model Y with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html&quot;&gt;Full Self Driving&lt;/a&gt;. I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as &quot;self-driving,&quot; which it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9&quot;&gt;Kia EV9&lt;/a&gt;, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romeokia.com/&quot;&gt;Kia dealer&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York&quot;&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt; which is practically in the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A post I wrote on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext. Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. &quot;show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.&quot; Like that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.</description>

			<description>Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season&quot;&gt;starts all over again&lt;/a&gt;. With love for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&amp;t=315s&quot;&gt;heart of gold&lt;/a&gt; team. Either way we win, imho. I know you're not supposed to feel that way, but that's how I feel right now. During the game, if we're losing, based on recent experience I won't like that so much. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>This blog is becoming a ChatGPT blog the same way when it started it was all about the web. I'd love to get pointers to other blogs whose content is largely about ChatGPT, so we can systematize learning about what we all are discovering. I think that blogs and ChatGPT are going to go together just like Google search and blogs did when search was booting up. Bloggers (not all of us, but some) provide good material for bootstraps. We just need to hook up blogs to social web, which is what I'm working on this year.</description>

			<description>Just tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/&quot;&gt;perplexity.ai&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Everyone's been raving about it. I asked it a question I asked ChatGPT in working on the RSS feeds for my current project. &quot;Suppose I had an RSS feed for a WordPress blog, and I wanted to include the id's of the site and post in the &amp;lt;item&gt; for each post. Is there a standard way to do this? If not, is there a namespace defined for WordPress blogs that might provide some prior art?&quot; Both were able to get me all the info I wanted, and answered follow-up questions. Perplexity got there sooner. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/search/suppose-i-had-axAhbuSgS2mD_JSQcj9qLA&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Why, after so many years are we still so controlled. When did we give up?&quot; I think you can do the design with words and dialogs, btw. Here's a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/18/facebookDialog.png&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; for keeping threads focused and civil on Facebook.

			<description>A few weeks ago I asked ChatGPT if it could transcribe an M4A audio file, the kind of file that Apple's voice memo app produces, and it said no, it couldn't do that. I gave it another try today and got a different answer. I uploaded the file, and it came close, it said it needed the file in WAV format. It gave me instructions for writing a desktop tool that would do the conversion. I expect in another couple of weeks they'll be able to deal with the M4A file directly.</description>

			<description>I think it would be really cool to have the voice interface for ChatGPT available on Amazon Echo. I kind of doubt that Amazon would want to do that. Alexa is nice, but really weak compared to ChatGPT.</description>

			<description>Do people understand the impact ChatGPT can have on how we control our software? No more hunting through menus among a thousand options to figure out how to do something. Just use natural human language. The UIs we've had to design and live with will be a thing of the past. Yet no one seems to be talking about this. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/9fe427a0-43b4-4f34-a830-39fdb4cdba37&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I've been trying to get transcripts of my voicemail, as easily as possible. In that example, it shows me how to do a variety of things. I kept asking if it could do it for me, all the way up to making a feature request of the developers at OpenAI. At some point they'll be able to add an item to my calendar, or make a feature request for me. That's the whole point of computers. They can do things for you. We call this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/24.html#a124347&quot;&gt;paving cow paths&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Most of the news stories about AI are bullshit by people who clearly have not attempted to understand what its capabilities are. This is the real thing folks. Amazing breakthroughs are happening every freaking day. So much improvement and so much potential. How do I know, because in comments on social media, people parrot the bullshit, like they always do. Journalism is still hugely influential, and they are dishonest, lazy, self-interested bordering on narcissism, and very very dangerous. We need to re-form journalism as if our continued existence depends on it.</description>

			<title>Knicks update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: For the 80,000th time -- the Knicks suck!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;All the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html&quot;&gt;funny farting&lt;/a&gt; didn't make a difference last night. The Knicks were &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-playoffs-pacers-lock-down-knicks-to-force-game-7-030512562.html&quot;&gt;blown out&lt;/a&gt;, again (sigh), by the Indiana team. My dear friend NakedJen texted me from Oklahoma of all places (I don't know how she got there, or why, she must be on her way to some other place, maybe Dallas?) that the Knicks are trying to kill her. Sums it up perfectly. I gave myself leave after the first few minutes of the fourth quarter, seeing where this thing was going. I went to bed, and knew that when I woke up there would be a Game 7 at the Garden on Sunday (3:30PM Eastern). I'm not sure how I feel about that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The odds are probably pretty good that the Knicks will win that game, but maybe they should just let it go, and we can pick this up again in October. By then all the injured players should be back, and maybe there will be an incredible new free agent signed over the summer, so we're not so dependent on one superstar, who is great, but has off nights, like last night. Why didn't he let any other Knicks try to fill in for him, when he's double teamed that means someone is open. I was screaming at the TV during the game, let someone someone else shoot dammit! Oh my gods. I hate game 7's when my team is in the game. I don't mind it if other people's teams are in a death match like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
