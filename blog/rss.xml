It's provably faster, and it makes it possible to build bigger machines that do more. The challenge of software development is to factor and factor so you can add another story to the skyscraper that your product has become. Eventually you have to stop building, one mind can't comprehend that much. Better tools makes it possible to build and manage more complex machines. I have no idea what's around the corner in software development when we can rely on cyber-minds to keep track of complexity for us. We'll have to develop new modes of communication between the human and computer brains, and I seriously doubt if it'll involve implants, more likely it'll happen first when we invent new language. And each of us should be able to create our own. At some point we'll realize we aren't even making sounds. It'll have sensors that learn how our bodies change when we have certain ideas. Who knows. But what possibilities!</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/18/radioUserLand.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I saw a thread somewhere about why &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; was used as the export format for feed readers. Not sure I've ever written about this. At the time we were finishing up &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, in either 2001 or 2002 (there were two big releases). I wanted a way to export the user's feed list so people could use the same list in another reader. This one decision is why there are so many feed readers imho. Because we offered no lock-in as a key feature, everyone else including Google had to do it with their products. Users had the expectation of data portability, so it's in the DNA of feed readers. Maybe we would have dominated the market with Radio if we didn't export the feed list, it was for a while the only feed reader, but more likely Google would have entered and clobbered us, users wouldn't have been able to use both products, or easily move on after Reader shut down. Anyway, why OPML? First, we had it around, it was new, I wanted people to use it, and I also wanted to use the outliner to edit my subscription lists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; didn't exist as an option at the time. And using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; for that seemed confusing and not right. RSS is a syndication format, representing a &lt;i&gt;flow&lt;/i&gt; of information, where OPML represents a list that evolves, but each item has permanence. It's static where RSS is dynamic. It's like the difference between a podcast and an album of music. You listen to a podcast once and it's gone,  you may listen to an album many times over decades. Fundamentally different kinds of data, with different needs in how they evolve, and thus the format you use to represent it. Yes we could have shoehorned feed lists into RSS, but 20 years later I'm glad we didn't.</description>

			<description>Noted that WordPress blogs &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;can now peer&lt;/a&gt; with Mastodon and other ActivityPub nodes. Suppose I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress site&lt;/a&gt; and my username is scripting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/272&quot;&gt;What address&lt;/a&gt; would you follow in Mastodon?</description>

			<description>I have a few virtual servers at Digital Ocean, and two of them are running &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;, so the sites hosted on these machines are HTTPS not HTTP. Caddy is the best. You install it, configure it and that's it. It takes care of all the michegas with the EFF, makes them completely invisible. Also makes it possible to switch thank goodness, I didn't miss that the EFF built themselves into the new system, not by force exactly, but by default. Heh. They get a lot of free marketing. Anyway, the fact that Caddy exists means that Amazon S3 could offer HTTPS access to everything I store there without me having to do anything but check a box in a dialog somewhere. So why don't they do it, make HTTPS zero cost to implement and maintain. They could even charge extra. It's kind of perfect, they know who I am better than anyone. We could make HTTPS disappear, which imho would be a good thing.</description>

			<title>Users should own their storage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you're a big company with deep pockets and lots of users. How about offering an identity service for users that includes storage that permitted apps can read and write, where the storage belongs to the user, not the developer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of AWS or Automattic, as examples. Trusted companies, known for technical excellence and a long-term vision. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What happens then? Well the net as a platform all of a sudden has the power of a personal computer, and the ownership is in the right hands, the users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The company that does this, with user freedom to switch, will have the developer market that Microsoft used to have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The company has to be big enough, stable, trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ChatGPT is the best thing ever</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thesis: ChatGPT is to AI tools as Napster was to streaming audio. The people get better tools to do their own programming. And it's neither good nor bad, but it is inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/14/fullSizeAppleAd.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/14/kitchenComputer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you might imagine the subject of &lt;i&gt;What To Do About AI&lt;/i&gt; was much-discussed at the Berkman reunion last week. Lots of hand-wringing. I was the only person who said that AI is wonderful, I can't wait to see what it can do next. When I started to give this schpiel, I was rushed along and made to stop I guess before their brains exploded? Really I wasn't allowed to finish the thought. This always happens when I go to Future of News conferences. I always ask the question, maybe you should embrace bloggers instead of fearing us. Maybe we can help? I almost started a session entitled &quot;ChatGPT is the best thing ever.&quot; That would have been fun. But I was at dinner when the sessions were reserved, so that didn't happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We never understand new tech in the first few years it's out. Personal computers, in the late 70s were thought to be Home Computers. The ads had pictures of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.printmag.com/advertising/making-the-mac-20-vintage-apple-ads/&quot;&gt;computers in the kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, storing recipes and shopping lists. Helping kids with homework or parents with the family budget. It wasn't until &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc&quot;&gt;VisiCalc&lt;/a&gt; that all the heads turned 180 degrees and realized oh shit, this is what we feared most (the old fear thing again) -- what happens when &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; in an organization can have a computer on their desk, unregulated by the IT people? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/docsearls/posts/pfbid025SC1UNWYyFe9BJYW8ERxXnLVyFVNYeNqE9WE45LwurmbC8kNfroFk61AjhsEXPzcl?notif_id=1694692897566518&amp;notif_t=close_friend_activity&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Can Humans Survive AI?&quot; comes &lt;a href=&quot;https://hls.indiana.edu/human-ai-intelligence/&quot;&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; which I would answer -- I have no freaking idea -- but we're not surviving &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; it, so why not give it a try? And to people who say the scifi authors were right, without even trying ChatGPT I say -- no they weren't right. So far, imho, AI is the best thing ever. Why not focus on the long-term unsolvable problems which now might have solutions with the new tech? And try to learn from our mistakes in previous generations of tech, not to try to stop the march of tech, but to find things it can do that we like or even love? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/94f9f3fe-43ad-47a5-a6c5-ccccd9701cfe&quot;&gt;250 words&lt;/a&gt; about early home computers and what happened when VisiCalc was introduced?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I think ChatGPT would be great at Jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Almost no disagreement. I'd add that we now are going to get another shot at conceiving a computer that's a lot easier to use, with the power of AI. Remember the example where I was able to specify what was basically an &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39&quot;&gt;SQL query&lt;/a&gt; in plain though precise English? That can also be applied to the user interface of a computer. Get me the phone number of the contractor I used to install the solar panels a few years ago. I'm sure the data is here on my computer, it might not be organized that way, but in a few months I'll have my own DaveBot who's read everything I've written everywhere and can answer all my questions (and yes, probably the CIA gets to ask questions too, let's hope Trump doesn't get elected, I'm not unaware of the dangers). And I won't have to remember how to build some app I wrote ten years ago. I won't even have to take notes. It's the paradise I never believed in is about to come to me.</description>

			<description>Last week at the reunion I got to spend a lot of time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/9cfa6104-b120-4ed0-879e-1e7b1939cdd1&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt;, which was great. We're both getting old, and one of these times will be the last one, but for now we're both still kicking around ideas and actually doing some of them. One of the things we share is that when we write up an idea on our blog or in a book it's probably because we want to work with others to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; that idea. Really pretty much all the time. And it's disheartening and not at all flattering to hear someone thank you for giving them that idea. This is the saddest thing in my life and it keeps happening. An example, I once went to visit Adam Curry in Amsterdam and he showed me an office full of people he hired to do what I had already done. Adam did that over and over. The problem is you can't hire someone to be Doc or me. No matter how many rooms you fill with attractive people. When you try to do our ideas, we've learned, people seem to always miss the heart of it. Anyway someone reading this may someday work with the source of the idea they love to make it reality and I will have done my good deed for the day.</description>

Suppose you're going to use a new piece of software to write your blog, something you do every day. Instead of converting to the new software first and diving into production, I would ask you to play with the new editor on the side, on posts that don't matter, maybe even &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2023/09/03/hello-world/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; by ChatGPT, until you're sure it fits your workflow. To surface and report all bugs that are in your way, or find acceptable workarounds. And only when you're satisfied that it works for you, should you consider switching to the new editor for production work. In my experience working with users, they switch too early and then panic when they find the software doesn't work the way they think it should. More generally you have to learn how to work so you don't have to panic, and you can easily back out of the decision if you decide it isn't right. When you're in panic mode you usually only make things worse. If you can afford to put the problem down for a couple of days and come back to it, you'll get to work faster and probably with a better result. The most important thing in working with computers, if you feel like you're panicking, stop.</description>

			<description>One thing I have to thank Berkman for is my new confidence. What a boost that meeting was. It took me back to a day when there were a dozen people I worked with regularly who were really first rate, and I was able to participate at my peak, that I did something uniquely valuable and was appreciated for it. I feel a million times more confident this week after the homecoming last week.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/22/whatsGoingOnWithGoogleRead.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Google seems to have the power to either seriously injure RSS, or perhaps set it free.

			<description>I just tripped over a 2018 rewrite of &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/phoenix/&quot;&gt;Developing Better Developers&lt;/a&gt;. I remembered writing this, but never could find it. I need to tell Google when I search for site:scripting.com to also include site:this.how. If anything the bits on this.how are more important than the ones on the much larger scripting.com. I could give these instructions, just like this, to ChatGPT and it would understand. It seems to me Google could start allowing us to configure the way Google sees us using natural language like this. Google has really held back the open web, by doing what big companies &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; do when they achieve dominance. Things ether stagnate or more likely in Google's case, move backwards.</description>

I was on the NY State Thruway going north, a few miles south of the exit for I-90E to Boston, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot&quot;&gt;FSD mode&lt;/a&gt;, in the right lane, when I see a hundred yards or so ahead a car with flashing lights in the shoulder. Before waiting to see what FSD would do, I signaled a left turn, which is a clever feature that tells the FSD software to switch lanes. It started to do so, then the software must've noticed the car with the flashing lights and inbetween the two lanes it hit the brakes hard, and slowed us down to a dangerous speed, esp if there had been a car behind us. But there was absolutely no danger. The car in the shoulder wasn't even close enough to make a difference if we had remained in the right lane, but we were leaving it. And it tried to stop us in no man's land. Insane. Anyone seeing this behavior would have thought I was drunk. So next time something like that happens if I'm in FSD mode, I'm going to cancel it by turning the steering wheel slightly and taking over fully. I have trouble believing people who let this thing drive without overriding it regularly.</description>

			<title>Federation vs Small Pieces Loosely Joined</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know, I went to a conference this week with lots of web thinkers, people I worked with 20 years ago. And after listening to them about the state of social networks, this is what I've come up with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's federation vs small pieces loosely joined. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'll go with the latter. The former is too complicated to work or deliver a benefit worth anything to anyone except chaos lovers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SPLJ delivers all the benefits, but is more fragile, probably slower, but easier to understand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Everyone has a radio station that broadcasts to the universe to which anyone can opt into listening to or not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's nowhere near as efficient as Twitter, but that's a good thing my friends. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The problem with Twitter is it makes everyone an easy target. This approach, well understood from the old days of blogging has the opposite challenge, getting anyone to hear you, but at least you can tune everyone else out, because that's the default. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The default on federated nets is the other way, everyone is on by default. This has been proven to be an awful approach, over and over. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Just because you don't know the lessons of the past doesn't somehow make you immune to them. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>First notes from the BKC 25 reuninon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My first thoughts on coming home, not well organized.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm back home after an incredible couple of days at the Berkman 25 year reunion. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was there 20 years ago. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We were on a roll toward inventing social media. We had learned a lot and were practicing it, and if we had continued, there's at least a chance there would be an open alternative to Facebook and Twitter now instead of all the trouble caused by their dominance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It probably wouldn't have needed much if any money, btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I believe investors would have wanted to invest on our terms in open source development at a university in 2003, but I didn't have the idea developed at the time enough to propose it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Very independently of my Berkman experience in 2014 I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; all about how an academic institution should welcome people back every few years to contribute to an ongoing open source project. If we had been able to do that for blogging, podcasting, RSS starting in 2003, and growing as the user base grew, with volunteers coming back to work on it whenever there was a need, and using the university to teach new generations how to do what the older generation knew how to do, I think it might have worked. At least it would have given the users a seat at the table when deciding how the technology would evolve. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It felt as if I had been forgotten in the Berkman world, but that was not the case. I was surprised at how much love there was there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I say if you get a chance to go back 20 years in time and hang out with the people you knew then -- &lt;i&gt;do it.&lt;/i&gt; So much of what you remember comes from the perspective of someone 20 years younger. You now know what happened. The story went on. You're in a fantastic place to learn, and you're also going to feel love stronger than you could have back then, because love grows enormously over time, even if you're not consciously aware of it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I described getting my fellowship at Berkman like being a kid, given a Harvard business card and told to go have fun. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hls.harvard.edu/office-of-event-scheduling-and-support/gallery-of-event-spaces/&quot;&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; knows how to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/08/harvardLawClassroom.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;classrooms&lt;/a&gt; for discourse.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>They just asked what mistakes did BKC make, and I learned for the first time in Charlie Nesson's talk that development was one of the early values, and when I came here, it was my hope was that we'd connect users and developers and make this a major activity of the university as I described in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/10/19/university&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/21/theJournoprogrammer.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. But BKC turned in a different direction, focusing on people who studied the internet, rather than people who made the internet.</description>

			<description>I'm listening to a speaker at the BKC reunion, a man I have great respect for but can't name due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; of this conference. He's talking about how to regulate AI, with the assumption that it's a looming catastrophe, without explaining why he feels that way, or why we should. As a reader of this blog you certainly know that I am very optimistic about the future of AI.</description>

			<description>Back in the 1970s when SQL was new, it was touted as an English-like database language. Now with ChatGPT you really can do database queries in actual English and it understands. Amazing. Whether the info is accurate or not (I suspect it is) is beside the point. It's doing something with language that has not been possible before. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39&quot;&gt;this query&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Make a table of 15 oscar-winning actors and actresses ranked by number of nominations, also include a column with the names of at most three of the movies they made that won best picture.&quot;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1698786873701695772&quot;&gt;full-length excerpt&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; piece on Twitter, and was surprised at the positive response. I had posted links to the full article many times, and mostly got flames from programmer priests, Googly trolls, but this time the message got through. It was RT'd 58 times, and got 24K views. Not bad for something most people would consider esoteric, yet is still fundamental the their continued freedom on the unowned open web.</description>

			<description>Just for fun the other day I asked ChatGPT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2023/09/04/christopher-lydon-and-amanda-palmer/&quot;&gt;150 words&lt;/a&gt; on Christopher Lydon and Amanda Palmer, wondering if it would find the connection between them. It wrote a paragraph profile on each, but did not discover that Palmer had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2IrTbWJxY&quot;&gt;written a song&lt;/a&gt; about Lydon.

			<source:outline text="Just for fun the other day I asked ChatGPT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2023/09/04/christopher-lydon-and-amanda-palmer/&quot;&gt;150 words&lt;/a&gt; on Christopher Lydon and Amanda Palmer, wondering if it would find the connection between them. It wrote a paragraph profile on each, but did not discover that Palmer had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2IrTbWJxY&quot;&gt;written a song&lt;/a&gt; about Lydon.

I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js&quot;&gt;wpcom package&lt;/a&gt; for Node.js to make calls about a user's WordPress account. I want to know what sites the user is following in their reader app. But they don't document the high-level call for that function, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1.1/get/read/following/mine/&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; at the REST level. So I ask ChatGPT what to do and it gives me the code I need. In the past I would probably have been able to piece it together with guesswork, trial and error. Might have taken a whole day. Now I have it working while I'm still drinking my morning coffee. BTW, I also had ChatGPT do code review, and it spots an error, and of course I fix it, happily.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/111012177596560602&quot;&gt;Posted on Masto&lt;/a&gt;: I find that ChatGPT is far better than Wikipedia at recounting history I know the truth about. Less subject to human manipulation, imho. When we criticize the machines we should remember what we have to compare them with and we should get &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; act together. Imagine if the AIs wrote critiques about our accuracy.</description>

			<title>Ideas for sessions</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm dumping these into the the Activity Feed for the Berkman reuinion but thought I should post them here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT is a miracle. It's one of those things like VisiCalc, the Mac UI, the WWW or Pointcast that after experiencing it I knew everything had changed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What makes for a great conference experience? How to keep the interesting stuff in the room from spilling out into the hallway.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A session about all the ways we love and miss John Perry Barlow. Have Charlie lead this discussion of course.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; Is there any way the web to be open in the future or is it doomed to be forever controlled by the nerds in silicon valley? And do they &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; know what's best for us? Why?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Based on all the people who say they were at BloggerCon, there must've been 100,000 people there, but there were actually only a couple of hundred. Were you one of them? Anything we could have done better?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
