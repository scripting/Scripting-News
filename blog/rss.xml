			<description>I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing with ten years ago. And they could have removed features from the language instead of piling on more and more random reinventions. End of editorial, now on with the new Bingeworthy.</description>

			<title>The new Bingeworthy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all of a sudden new items started appearing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;the new Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought oh geez there's some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but quickly realized &lt;i&gt;someone was using it&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;it was working. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with first, and I wanted to fix up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/bingeworthy/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, such as they are, but I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the TwitterPocalypse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; is the app I missed the most that hadn't been ported off Twitter identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you're getting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The most important features are there, although they don't necessarily look that great. I want to do some more work there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you have any questions or problems, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on the Mac in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There's a slight typo, but rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to find. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/07/bingeworthyLogoForScriptingNews.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The all-new logo for Bingeworthy, via ChatGPT of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They've had enough time not only to hit all the walls, but to try out different approaches and settle on one. Maybe at times there were competing ways to do things, like the way Bluesky and ActivityPub, and probably Threads, and certainly Facebook and Twitter insist on reinventing &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. But when I ask ChatGPT &quot;can you do this in MySQL&quot; it gives me one or two ways to do it, but usually just one. These are things I never would have found in the old Google-search way of finding answers. An example, I wanted to find out if there was a MySQL way to query a value inside a JSON object, and the answer is (of course) yes. And you can create an index on such a value. I didn't even ask for it, ChatGPT volunteered, guessing it would be my next question (it was). Whatever happened in the evolution of SQL it was a lot healthier than what's going on now in the social web, where the creators completely ignored what came before, and each other, and as a result there's a proliferation of different ways to do things we've known how to do for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;over 20 years&lt;/a&gt;. SQL has been around for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe they went through this stage and emerged from it with a better answer. This feels a bit like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/677bf6d0-b868-8012-af56-7e4449e9182f&quot;&gt;Fermi paradox&lt;/a&gt; and I'm a time traveler who has managed to witness 50 years of evolution long after the fact, any day of any week I want to thanks to ChatGPT. Also this is why it is so important to keep the archives of the 1990's web preserved. We may need to loop back to this when the people responsible for the social web decide that interop is important as opposed to each of them going it alone.</description>

Just thinking out loud here. Working with a group of people. It's possible it's just the author and editor, or it could be a larger documentation job, or a report covering a lot of ground. In 2025 we'd use AI to find the threads in our writing, to maintain a book outline that changes as our writing goes forward. Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started. I've yet to use a ChatGPT-like service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for writing this kind of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand. I would write a post about a feature as I thought about it, but not worry about how it fits into the rest of the book. Trust the AI organizer to help us do something sensible.</description>

Makes our apps more expensive to maintain, and we waste time and human wear and tear on stupid bullshit make-work. Developers are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we're working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let's throw some more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism, whatever the source is, it's not a good way to introduce yourself. And, even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error message about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834&quot;&gt;legacy blob&lt;/a&gt; bullshit. They've already done this, and they're just getting started. It's why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying to force us to adapt to them. I'll do it one more time, and then that's it. They can fix my code next time they break it.</description>

Arrogance, narcissism, whatever the source is, it's not a good way to introduce yourself. And, even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error message about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834&quot;&gt;legacy blob&lt;/a&gt; bullshit. They've already done this, and they're just getting started. It's why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying to force us to adapt to them. I'll do it one more time, and then that's it. They can fix my code next time they break it." created="Sun, 05 Jan 2025 15:28:29 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage3.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/05.html#a152829"/>

			<title>Gambling, sports, kids</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman writes&lt;/a&gt; about social media is poisoning children's minds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like that Krugman has resumed his blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that sometimes I agree or disagree, or have mixed opinions, but I always learn something. That's what makes a blogger good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I agree that children's minds are being poisoned. But I am pretty sure when people like Krugman and myself reach a certain age, and we are the same age, we start looking at new media that way. Maybe &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; minds are poisoned. My father called television the &quot;idiot box.&quot; But it eventually became the literature of my generation, often very good. But maybe laws can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the NFL, MLB and tennis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And is this why they can now afford to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-agrees-to-contract-with-mets&quot;&gt;sign players&lt;/a&gt; to $765 million contracts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're all getting hugely rich, but I believe that they are certainly doing great harm to the new sports fans growing up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a math major and a 50+ year programmer, and I know that if you gamble enough you lose all your money. And as an addiction no gambler ever gets up from the table to enjoy their winnings when they win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in WordLand on New Years Day, saving it for a good moment on Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Little Feed Reader on Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;little feed reader&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lerbu7ugvc2i&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/a&gt; for you to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is how the pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;i&gt;blogroll&lt;/i&gt; category on feedland.social to determine what's posted on Bluesky. When I add or remove feeds from the category, the OPML adjusts dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm running a new Node app that has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/websocket&quot;&gt;websocket&lt;/a&gt; connection to feedland.social. It receives all the new items as they are found from all feeds over the socket. It's feedland.social's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/firehose-api/&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt;. Since I'm currently the only user of that server, it's getting news from the all feeds I follow, not just the ones in the blogroll category. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app checks each new item to see if it's in one of the feeds in the OPML list. If so, it reformats it to fit in a Bluesky post and sends it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;feediverse account&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're subscribed you should see the item, with a link, in your Bluesky timeline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app re-loads the OPML subscription list every minute so any change is quickly reflected.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; you &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/expandedBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog's home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; in getting this running was rate-limiting. I have dealt with this on Twitter and other services, but Bluesky was not, for a while, letting anything through with the error message that we were over the limit. It was suggested that we should cache the accessToken rather get a new one for every message. I did that and cautiously turned the server on again at first with a 5 message per hour self-imposed limit, then gradually increased it to 10 per hour. The latest version only requires that there be at least five minutes between posts, so that means no more than 12 per hour. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lerhvj52pk27&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt; for the initial idea and his support. He saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and asked if it could work in Bluesky. That was the idea. I have always wanted a tight coupling between Bluesky and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; but didn't know how to do it. We may have just skipped a step. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We realllly could use some more formating features in Bluesky messages. This is a really strong use-case imho for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The coolest thing from my point of view is that I already had all the pieces, fully developed, the only thing that remained was to hook them together. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/feediverse/bluesky/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for Little Feed Reader. It's purposely brief, but I have put a link to this post on that page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="The biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; in getting this running was rate-limiting. I have dealt with this on Twitter and other services, but Bluesky was not, for a while, letting anything through with the error message that we were over the limit. It was suggested that we should cache the accessToken rather get a new one for every message. I did that and cautiously turned the server on again at first with a 5 message per hour self-imposed limit, then gradually increased it to 10 per hour. The latest version only requires that there be at least five minutes between posts, so that means no more than 12 per hour." created="Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:44:31 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/02/143149.html#a144431"/>
					<source:outline text="Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lerhvj52pk27&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt; for the initial idea and his support. He saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and asked if it could work in Bluesky. That was the idea. I have always wanted a tight coupling between Bluesky and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; but didn't know how to do it. We may have just skipped a step." created="Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:32:33 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/02/143149.html#a143233"/>
					<source:outline text="We realllly could use some more formating features in Bluesky messages. This is a really strong use-case imho for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; idea." created="Thu, 02 Jan 2025 14:42:03 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/02/143149.html#a144203"/>

It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; and edited a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;complete blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a response to something &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman wrote&lt;/a&gt;, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso&quot;&gt;Marge said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Fargo. &quot;There's more to life than a little money, you know.&quot; It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper&quot;&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.</description>
