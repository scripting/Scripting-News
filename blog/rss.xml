			<description>There's been a slowdown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;, I believe it's related to a limit reached on the database server. But for now you may see it take a long time to load pages. I have a ticket open with Digital Ocean. Update: Problem fixed.</description>

			<description>If the Democrats had a sense of the moment they'd run the campaign on a plan to regain control of the House and keep the Senate and White House so we can pass a law that legalizes abortion in the whole country. Give people a positive reason to elect a governing majority. Think powerfully.</description>

			<title>Biden &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a fine president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and proto-blogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just made it a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing about Gaza is that there's the rest of the world, and they're watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been such an asshole to the US. He's a freaking MAGA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure. The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there's another path, compassion and help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But they're doing it the only way we can, given who we are.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we never have. Journos seem to think Americans can't understand the basics of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn't really any more complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We need an analogous rule that says there should be no reporting on polls until after the election, to allow the people to form their own opinions, for the same reason. Also, people are less likely to vote if they feel the outcome is a foregone conclusion. People even form their decision re who to vote for based on the polls. That's not a very healthy way for a country to govern itself.</description>

			<description>The big deal with ChatGPT is that it's a huge improvement over search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the pieces together. I don't care how it does it, it's a much higher level tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a computer.</description>

			<description>When I was a grad student in Comp Sci, I was a teaching assistant for a class in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ece252.ece.wisc.edu/ch07_inclass_01_assembly_language.pdf&quot;&gt;assembly language&lt;/a&gt; programming for a couple of years. One of my responsibilities was to grade the work of the students. Later, I was the CEO and lead developer at a software company I founded, and there I had to review other people's source code. I was pretty fussy about writing understandable code, because it was my job in both places to understand their code, and I also knew, even when I was just a TA, how important it is that your code be human-readable, not just machine-readable. I just want to say if ChatGPT were a student of mine, its code would get an A+, with thanks from the teacher for making my life easier.</description>

			<description>Actually it would get an A+ if it were a student, but not a very high grade for a member of my development team, because it can't seem to learn my coding style. I've pasted an awful lot of my code into its &quot;tiny little text box&quot;.</description>

			<description>Ben Werdmuller &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/2024/why-i-wont-have-a-blogroll&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; why he won't have a blogroll. This is the kind of thread we used to form in the old school blogosphere. I don't have an opinion about whether he will or won't have one, but for me, the process of putting this together in 2024 has been a really good thing. I'm better in touch with what other people are doing. My blogroll does more than it did 20 years ago. Actually it's a lot like his &lt;a href=&quot;https://sources.werd.io/&quot;&gt;Sources page&lt;/a&gt;, but more compact. I'm glad we're having this discussion. It's &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what I hoped would happen. And of course my feed list is behind my blogroll.</description>

			<title>Blogs for social web apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In a new product I'm working on, I'm including links to the blogs of the social media apps I use. I notice that most of them have one. This is why:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can put a title on a post on a blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can include links (invariably announcements have links).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can edit posts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Simple text styling.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blogs have feeds.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking for the official blogs of the social apps I use -- Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, Threads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If so, what's the feed URL? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It seems dumb to have two places for writing. &lt;s&gt;Also I bet Bluesky wrote their own blogging software, which is why there's no feed for their blog, which is awkward because Bluesky itself has feeds. As a programmer, I don't think I could maintain both codebases, and i'm pretty sure the blog is the one that'll get abandoned.&lt;/s&gt; Update: they do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294#issuecomment-1973571777&quot;&gt;have a feed&lt;/a&gt; for their blog. At some point there won't be a distinction between blogging and social media-ing. Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt; have to go. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Twitter's blog has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.x.com/en_gb/blog.rss&quot;&gt;really shitty title&lt;/a&gt;, it shows up in the list as English (UK). That should be fixed to something like Twitter Blog. I know how this happens, obviously they're maintaining more than one language, so the title is given from their point of view. As a reader, it has to make sense in a list of feeds from different publishers. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/01/howCouldYouTellThatsTwitter.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="PS: It seems dumb to have two places for writing. &lt;s&gt;Also I bet Bluesky wrote their own blogging software, which is why there's no feed for their blog, which is awkward because Bluesky itself has feeds. As a programmer, I don't think I could maintain both codebases, and i'm pretty sure the blog is the one that'll get abandoned.&lt;/s&gt; Update: they do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/294#issuecomment-1973571777&quot;&gt;have a feed&lt;/a&gt; for their blog. At some point there won't be a distinction between blogging and social media-ing. Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt; have to go. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 01 Mar 2024 17:13:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/01/145758.html#a171310"/>
				<source:outline text="PPS: Twitter's blog has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.x.com/en_gb/blog.rss&quot;&gt;really shitty title&lt;/a&gt;, it shows up in the list as English (UK). That should be fixed to something like Twitter Blog. I know how this happens, obviously they're maintaining more than one language, so the title is given from their point of view. As a reader, it has to make sense in a list of feeds from different publishers.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Brad Pettit is playing with ChatGPT's image drawing capability, and had a brilliant idea, feed it the lyrics to a song and see what it comes back with. He tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDGorIWYz-A&quot;&gt;Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys&lt;/a&gt; by Traffic, a great song, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/bradpettit/posts/pfbid0m7TE3T5LJVr9Z5QznWdtWPS9bJxrXKnw1NX3UCeUtpqcg9Sg6SiNphqk7Cg7dKCel&quot;&gt;the image&lt;/a&gt; was really cool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This game me the idea to try it with a few of my favorite songs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/01/dixieChicken.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RvR3j535qc&quot;&gt;Dixie Chicken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/01/aapoliticalblues.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkVijd9g_Hk&quot;&gt;A Apolitical Blues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/01/callAnyVegetable.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BAu059IMYw&quot;&gt;Call Any Vegetable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
