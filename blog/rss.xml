			<description>I've been working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=daytona&quot;&gt;search function&lt;/a&gt; for this blog, and now we have all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=davenet&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt; pieces between 1994 and 2004 in the database. &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=autoweb&quot;&gt;Autoweb&lt;/a&gt; was my first static site generator. Here's a search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22&quot;&gt;menu sharing&lt;/a&gt; which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.</description>

			<description>How to understand Trump talking about tariffs. Remember how he talked about Covid. Same thing.When I announced Chris Lydon's podcast in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html&quot;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, I called it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22weblog%20for%20the%20ears%22&quot;&gt;weblog for the ears&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>And with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database&quot;&gt;this update&lt;/a&gt;, we don't depend on OPML any longer to create the database, all the data is exported in a format that can be easily imported directly into an SQL database. I provide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database#the-sql-table&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/a&gt; and example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database#code-to-import&quot;&gt;JavaScript code&lt;/a&gt; that, via SQL, updates a database. Hopefully this creates a better more useful archive.</description>

			<description>Apparently Chrome has changed the behavior of images served over http in web pages. It's changing the request to https, so it gives an erroneous error message about the certificate which the page never claimed to have.</description>

But Chrome wouldn't stay out of the way, so had to give up. Hey I was trying to route around their outage.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2tjsq6a4vn6pww2iva5qj23v&quot;&gt;Andrew Hickey&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I support, also appears to be strongly against people using ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a programmer, so you might think I'd see it the same way because what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I create &quot;intellectual property&quot; which can be easily copied.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share what we do and let other people use it. They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say &quot;no one did anything first&quot; (paraphrasing) and that's basically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html&quot;&gt;same idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I don't doubt that the next big media invention, the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the people developing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This appeared earlier as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E&quot;&gt;grabbing&lt;/a&gt; Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.</description>

			<title>Ads used to be this great</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Look at this, for an idea of what a product says to the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes you laugh. When you laugh inside an idea forms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ain't it the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That gets you ready to read the pitch, which is stuff you wouldn't have read or even considered if they hadn't said something so true right up front.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/17/uglyAd.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ugly is only skin-deep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what's wrong with the opposition political party in the US, they think all they need to do is recite the facts. But first you have to convince them you speak from the heart, you'll tell the truth, even if it hurts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's an ugly car. Yeah, but you'll come to love how ugly it is because it's so beautiful inside. What you say next hardly matters, because they already believe that you speak the truth. And that's when they're ready to sign on the dotted line.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what the Republicans do so well, before and after Trump, that the Democrats don't even gets exists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out what the Dems need, the top guy has to be an entrepreneur. Needs to understand how to get people ready to believe the truth. And make the product deliver a truth the people choose. And now sign on the dotted line. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: More &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontsinuse.com/uses/1976/volkswagen-of-america-ads-1960-68&quot;&gt;Volkswagen ads&lt;/a&gt; from the 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Knicks really did win</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Knicks did actually win last night. I didn't dream it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember when the Knicks sucked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my heart I believe they still do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here we are, my Knicks actually have an approximately 1 in 4 chance of winning the championship. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope it's Minnesota we end up playing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All in the family. 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And as long as I can get a good selection of interesting stuff to listen to on my phone, there's no reason look elsewhere.

A few nasty people in the early 00s did a number on RSS and started putting that awful word next to RSS.

And now here we are 2.5 decades later and people are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; doing it. You should self-censor on that one, those people are long-gone, probably doing stuff with crypto or nuzzling up to oligarchs, and you're keeping their asshole-ness alive. That's pretty fucked up.</description>

			<description>I wanted to design a Google Form, and thought to ask ChatGPT for instructions from a spec I wrote.

I would have laughed out loud if they did, but alas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/add0560b6b02&quot;&gt;just instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually they will do that for you.</description>

			<title>About the Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanson has been working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/&quot;&gt;Baseline theme&lt;/a&gt; and it's ready for people to try out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme for WordLand-authored WordPress sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site running in WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the features you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Scott has said he'd be happy to work with others to make it so that it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As the developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way blogs implement various features in 2025. It's been a long time since we took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used, especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging predates both. So of course the &lt;i&gt;presentation&lt;/i&gt; of the blog has opportunities to evolve as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line -- if you already have a WordPress theme you're happy with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you're starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I have it installed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse.org&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm a happy camper. So we have one endorsement. It's a good start. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have comments or questions, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/88&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; to post them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Video demo of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G3nh7Mj8QI&quot;&gt;categories editor&lt;/a&gt; in WordLand. I wanted to be able to add new categories and edit the descriptions of existing categories without having to leave WordLand. I feel that categories are an important part of writing.</description>

I've pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me think I must be dreaming. &lt;i&gt;NYK leads 3-1.&lt;/i&gt; Yesterday at this time (5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and the beginning of last night's game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks couldn't seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It's primitive, but it's real. However! In the second half it turned around. The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by &lt;i&gt;being better&lt;/i&gt; than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must've relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we're up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one, it's over. No I didn't think we'd be here tonight. Remember that when you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as unbelievable as that might be.</description>

I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda. I know I'm watching the Knicks tonight, with a certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html?title=theKnicksAndTheEpicFart&quot;&gt;dread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.</description>

			<title>What do I really own?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree &quot;I own you.&quot; The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. &quot;I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die.&quot; I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership.

			<title>Software isn't a thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When a friend discovers a new product of mine and says the world owes Dave for being such a great guy, I wish they'd skip that part, and follow what we're doing. Get in the loop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Software isn't a thing, it isn't finished, it's a process as it gets invented by the users. It's a performing art. WordLand today is like a musician performing in a small club, working out the playlist, and hoping to be playing at theaters then arenas, and finally someday, if we're very good, stadiums. But we need help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you love WordLand, subscribe. Use the software. Learn what it can do, hit its limits, make requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember very well being handed a list of feature requests by Apple's lead evangelist from a new exec they just hired at Apple. I looked at the list, and handed it back and said I'd like to meet him. On the paper was the top ten list of &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; MORE user at the time. We knew what they wanted because we listened, studied, and learned. I knew his new boss was a real user, and thus I knew we could do stuff together. It worked out exactly that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you love it, use it, &lt;i&gt;become part of it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've written about this over the years with the motto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+shitty+software&quot;&gt;we make shitty software&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>America as a platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We lived for the first years of my life in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights&quot;&gt;Jackson Heights&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably, today, the most culturally diverse place in the world. In the 1960s it was a white neighborhood that was adjacent to a black neighborhood, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;. They paired our elementary schools when I was in third or fourth grade. My little brother went to the school in Corona, and I stayed in the school in Jackson Heights. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/05/10/eveWinerPeterWinerWalkToSchool.png&quot;&gt;famous picture&lt;/a&gt;, in our family at least, of my mother walking my brother to school. It was on the front page of the NYT one day. That was a big deal then.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was in fifth grade we moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;. It was a sleepy little place (for NYC), nice houses, mostly Irish and Italian families with a few Jews. Now it's a Far East culture, from China and Korea, and still just as nice as it ever was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have a system in this country, it takes people from everywhere and gives them a platform to create whatever they want.

			<title>My programmer friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been writing the colorful saga of my sad depressed programmer friend on Facebook, and it was getting some interest from friends until I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308&quot;&gt;moved it into a group&lt;/a&gt; and now no one reads it, which makes me sad and depressed too because the story of my programmer friend took an interesting turn after he maxed out on space, got a call from the NBA commisioner asking if he would mind officiating the Knicks two playoff games in Boston this last week. My friend, was of course quite sad and depressed, but he was also exhausted and bored, so he said yes. Here he is before the first of two games, which partially thanks to his officiating were near-blowouts for the Celtics, and thus the Knicks are up 2-0 heading into tomorrow's game in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/sadFriendInBostonKnicksWinHaha.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Friend sadly officiating at the TD Garden in Boston.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The latest Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say the latest &lt;i&gt;Baseline&lt;/i&gt; theme looks great!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I just wrote, in the WordLand editor, and the writing experience was excellent. It took a long time and a lot of work to get it there, but it is there now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as the post says, it's not just a blog post, it's also a tweet. And it's not a miracle, it's just endless iteration over both sides, the reading and writing, until it felt right. So far all that's visible is the writing side. But I know something about reading too, having written a number of feed readers over the years, including the first one. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Scott Hanson on one side of this effort and me on the other, him the developer, me the user (ie writer of blog posts and tweets) -- we wrestled with WordPress themes. I wanted a minimal design, a place to start -- which is why the theme is called Baseline. It's a Christmas Tree without any ornaments. None. A fresh start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be a release of this theme in a short while. I just wanted to boast a bit about what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/baselineExample.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the post rendered in Baseline theme.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;viewed in the web&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/wordlandEditor.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the post being edited in WordLand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Also, I applied the new Baseline theme to my daveverse site, the one I use to test stuff in WordLand, and occasionally write something with a bit of lasting value. As a result it got a new domain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse.org&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to offer the &lt;i&gt;Baseline&lt;/i&gt; theme for others to use after a bit more testing and refining. But it's getting close. It seems like it's the last big thing on the agenda, but something else will probably pop up. Praise Murphy.</description>

It feels like 2015, when the Mets would be down 9-0 in the seventh, and you'd tune in to see how they would win. At the very end of the Knicks game tonight, when the Celtics were up by 1, I thought how would this feel if the Knicks came back so far and didn't win. I should've known better. All those insufferable years when we wore &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/27/knicksFansWithBagsOverHeads.png&quot;&gt;paper bags to hide our faces&lt;/a&gt;, even if this is as far as the Knicks get this year, it will have been worth it. Sports teaches you to believe, if you wait long enough your team teaches you that. I've learned it from the Mets so many times, and the Knicks now. I just wish &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier&quot;&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; were doing the color with Mike Breen doing the play by play. But who cares, this was great sports. Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt&quot;&gt;Monica McNutt&lt;/a&gt; on MSG in a daze. It's like homecoming. I might just splurge for a ticket to Saturday night's game. It's a pretty easy drive.</description>

			<description>I want the &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2025/05/07/hyundai-unveils-new-elexio-electric-suv-with-435-miles-range/&quot;&gt;EV's they're getting in China&lt;/a&gt;. Because we've got these stupid trade barriers we can't get the latest tech. Imagine in say 1984 you were a developer outside the US and you couldn't get a Mac. Then, perhaps Trump's tariff might have a slight chance of working. Now we're on the outside looking in.</description>
