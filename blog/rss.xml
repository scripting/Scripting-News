			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/09/05/goneWithTheWind.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Good morning and welcome to June. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml&quot;&gt;month gone&lt;/a&gt;, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven't had a drink in months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen who isn't as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply &quot;Let's go Mets!&quot; I like that, though it will of course take me some time to get re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-highlight-jalen-josh-explain-why-the-yankees/id1729497779?i=1000710590814&quot;&gt;his podcast&lt;/a&gt; that New York has two teams, the Knicks (I agree) and the Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team without &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change some things over the summer, and I've heard that they might try to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22kevin%20durant%22&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt;. I sure hope not. I think the Knicks are benefiting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/&quot;&gt;the jinx&lt;/a&gt; he put on himself when he tried in vain to stir up a &quot;rivalry&quot; between the Knicks and the Brooklyns. No, that isn't likely to happen, unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the butt like KD did. Maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers&quot;&gt;Portland Trail Blazers&lt;/a&gt; will want him. That's about as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/New+York,+NY/Portland,+OR/@41.7399086,-119.4458701,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2m2!1d-74.0059728!2d40.7127753!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950b0b7da97427:0x1c36b9e6f6d18591!2m2!1d-122.6783853!2d45.515232!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; from New York as you can get in the NBA. And with that I now officially shut the door on the 2024-25 NBA season. We had a great run. See you all in October! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>
