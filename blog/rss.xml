			<description>It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to exist. It's possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they would arrange things this way. Just-in-time species reboot.</description>

The idea was lovely, they had solved two important problems, identity and world-scale publishing. It took years to get there, but they did eventually do it. They were also liberal in granting access to their API, though because of some dick moves leading up to their IPO, they got a rep for the opposite, as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_good_deed_goes_unpunished&quot;&gt;no good deed goes unpunished&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I've been listening to the Grateful Dead today. Today my most favorite Dead song is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmMjY6tXaEo&quot;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;. I love the bass beat, and the simple lyric. A wonderful sing-along. Let there be songs to fill the air. A song about singing. Love it.</description>

I like using the editor that I do all my writing in, and I don't see why I can't just post directly from there. Even if they don't have an API, it's pretty easy to set it up so it posts from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt;. If you're thinking about leaving Substack, good for you. Please insist that your new platform lets you post via a feed. If they say it's too hard, give them my email address, and I'll show them how to do it.</description>

			<title>My night at the Dean campaign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd love to tell you a story about the time I had the authority to post to the Dean campaign home page, and they deleted a post I wrote on the night of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0&quot;&gt;Dean Scream&lt;/a&gt; that might have saved the campaign. They were trying to make the story go away. As we know the story didn't go away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/22/iWasAtDeanHqTheNightTheyDi.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The campaign had video that showed clearly that the press was actively trying to kill his candidacy. They had a website, and they had enough money to pay for the bandwidth to run it. They knew what the press was trying to do. They could have fought it. But they didn't.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/12/15/deanForAmericaBumperSticker.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;That night I became friends with Nicco Mele, he was the webmaster at Dean who &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/28/itsAWrap.html#remindsMeOfAStory&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; me the power. I was in their Burlington headquarters at the moment the whole thing imploded, the night of the Iowa caucus. I've also become friends with Joe Trippi, the campaign manager for Dean in 2008. They probably accelerated the adoption of online media in American politics by a decade or more. However, a lot of the ideas from that time are gone, but hopefully not forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest idea was that it gave people a sense of belonging, that they weren't powerless to influence or even control the US government. We all felt that the war in Iraq was wrong, Dean gave Americans a way to say that clearly, with their own actions. I think if we want to achieve our destiny in the 2024 election, we need to get some of that into the campaign, or democracy won't prevail.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a story about how Trump makes people feel like they belong in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3U224ud&quot;&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; written by Philip Bump that Joe and Nicco should read if they haven't. This is something Trump gets that the Democrats have forgotten they know. People don't vote on policy, they vote to belong to something they believe might fix things, whatever that means to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I also blogged about my adventure at the Dean campaign headquarters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2004&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2004/01/18.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html#When:9:56:50AM&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;during&lt;/a&gt; the Iowa caucus and the Dean campaign implosion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040407155545/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/2004/01/19#a418&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the blogging room in Burlington the night of the Iowa caucus in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: In February 2004, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; summing up what we learned from Dean. &quot;In a virtual sense, the Internet was looking for a candidate, and Howard Dean fit the bill. He was bloggable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ideas for Reading Lists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; is a list of feeds you can subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author of the list can add or remove feeds. When they do, people who subscribe to the list are subscribed to the new feeds and unsubbed from the ones that leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading lists are not a new topic, I and others have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+reading+lists&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+reading+lists&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; for years. But they've not been used seriously in the past because they weren't widely supported in feed readers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, my latest feed manager, has reading list support built-in. And we're serious about starting new communities of feeds and users with this feature. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a feed reader user, you probably know about using OPML to move your subscriptions from one app to another, or to share lists with friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading lists take it one step further, you can subscribe to a reading list, so you can control one app from another.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say I had a reading list with my favorite podcasts and my podcasting client could subscribe to it. Then when I add a feed to that list on my desktop computer, the podcast client would automatically be subscribed to it. Or if I used two or more podcast clients (say one on Android and one on iOS), I could control both from the same subscription list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It factors out subscribing. Now you can use one app to manage subscriptions and use lots of apps to read them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's cool about this is that it opens up the possibility for lots of viewer apps. A podcast client is a special kind of feed reader. I'm sure others are possible. But first, to make this practical we need to do better with subscriptions. That's what reading lists are for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another idea. Suppose we wanted to put together a big list of great blogs about Major League Baseball (just an example). I might know a few about the Mets, and my friend Scott who lives in Mountain View, CA, would have a bunch about the Giants. We could put together a group of 100 avid baseball fans, and one of us could put out a reading list for all of our feeds merged into one list. It's not so far-fetched, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; can do that today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could see a similar &quot;big blogroll&quot; for the IndieWeb, or for Bluesky developers -- or really anything. We just have to get started, prime the pump, and learn how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt it was really important to get reading lists built into FeedLand in the current release, because now we're in a position, with the improvements in scaling, to act as a organizing node for new activities with feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is another form of federation, it's more ad hoc, and doesn't require very much technical knowledge. If you know how to use a feed reader, and move around OPML files, you can do all of what I describe in this piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We're supposed to leave a good trail behind us, but I've only managed to do that in certain ways. For example, I have standardized on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/worknotes.md&quot;&gt;worknotes.md&lt;/a&gt; file for each of my projects and I'm pretty good about updating it. I also publish the OPML source of my code, which contains a lot more in the way of internal docs than the JavaScript files I publish alongside them, simply because the outline format lends itself to inline docs, and I have been doing that systematically for at least thirty years. And I now include the OPML source in most projects in a file called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/source.opml&quot;&gt;source.opml&lt;/a&gt;. There's a big comment at the top of each of the files at the top that explains. If you're interested, work backward through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/a&gt; of my repos.</description>

			<title>&quot;Overturn an election?&quot;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase that seems wrong to me, I'll work on it until I figure out why it seems wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That said, I don't think Trump tried to &quot;overturn an election.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More accurately, he tried to &quot;overthrow the government.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I say that:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would be overturn. Overturn doesn't convey the illegitimacy of what Trump tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American values. He tried to &quot;overturn&quot; our most sacred ritual, the transfer of power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people. Overthrow is a much better word for what was done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you commit a crime, say for example killing someone, we don't say they tried to illegally use a weapon, that's too technical, we say they're &quot;accused of murder.&quot; We focus on the consequences. There are lots of ways to illegally use a weapon, what matters is the intended result.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all circumstances. It's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;20th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when Joe Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0&quot;&gt;took the oath&lt;/a&gt;, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath, at 12PM exactly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can also look at the government as a continuous thing, the only difference is there is a new person occupying the office of president. Same government, the one defined by the Constitution. Always on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn't follow the Constitution.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I asked &quot;Is news copyrightable&quot; on various social web sites because people aren't making a distinction between the expression and the underlying facts of news. If an AI bot reads a news article, and extracts the facts, then there's no problem, because no one owns the facts.</description>

			<description>A puzzle about ChatGPT. How can it get something right that both Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a source, thus propagating its lies and mistakes. I think this negates the idea that they're just scanning the news orgs to get their information. The method obviously is more sophisticated.</description>

			<description>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and say &quot;learn this&quot; and then a few hours or days later I'd be able to ask it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of therapy.</description>

He said I was a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;sports writer&lt;/a&gt; and boasted of the current Celtics team (he's from Boston). They're worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting players. They were great before they added &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827&quot;&gt;Kristaps Porzingis&lt;/a&gt;, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He's one of those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year's Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the Warriors or Kings in this year's finals. Anyway, I write sports for people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and front and center. I'm glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even win. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Speaking of Fargo, at first I thought it was ridiculous to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm&quot;&gt;Jon Hamm&lt;/a&gt; cast as the fascist police chief of a small North Dakota town, but he's a really good actor (of course) and by episode 8, I'm convinced.</description>

If you're running Brave or using an Android tablet, could you give it a try per Rich's description, see if you can reproduce. Also curious if there are error messages in the JavaScript console.

			<title>Random WordPress idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caveat: This very likely already exists. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Random idea for my friends at Automattic. How about a theme for a WordPress site that's good for technical subjects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should have good default styles for code. Handle screen shot images gracefully. Basically a way of using WordPress for documenting the kinds of things we write up on GitHub because their editor is designed to work well for technical stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking out loud. A good test case would be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't look too great after years of no-updates (more than 20 years) and browser slippage? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It started life as a Manila site, transitioned to WordPress, and now I believe it's a static site. At one time it looked good in WordPress. It could totally use the kind of treatment &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt; got, but obviously it's serving a different purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am going to ask for a discussion about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page for RSS&lt;/a&gt;, because I think it misses the significance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, how it became a big thing. It had little to do with the quality of the technical work, there wasn't much of that, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798834000&quot;&gt;quality varied&lt;/a&gt; as has been pointed out many times. What made it happen was a vision by some exec at Netscape (whose name is never in the writeups, probably because it isn't on the Wikipedia page), a pitch, and a leap of faith by publishers: Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. And if they hadn't, there wouldn't have been anything worth fighting for. I never would have gotten involved, and blogging might not have been part of RSS, as it was. Then, a few years later, the NYT. And then everyone. It's an interesting story, imho -- and it would be good to make the story available to future would-be innovators. Don't design a perfect format and expect the world to beat a path to your door, it doesn't work that way. You have to keep coming back to the problem, try a new approach, gain some traction, and hope you're not going down a blind alley. The actual story of how it happened belongs on that page.</description>

			<description>I know Elon Musk isn't popular, but I saw an older interview of his where he said something important that most people don't realize about technology. Sometimes we lose abilities we had in the past. His example was space travel. In the sixties we went to the moon. A decade later we could only put people in earth orbit. A few decades after that, not so much. I've seen this in software and networks. In some ways they have become far more powerful, in terms of bandwidth, CPU speed and the cost of storage. But software-wise, the runtime that we develop for today is a shadow of what it was in the 80s. We gave up a lot in going to the web, and made some terrible decisions, collectively, about languages and styling. JavaScript is horrendous for building complex systems, the worst language imaginable, but we use it as the default. And CSS, it's disgusting how hard it is to control, at things it claims to be good at. If only we were using C or Pascal, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;. When you study how these systems evolved, the discontinuities and how they were usually the result of a company trying to own something they could have let everyone build on (the Mac UI for example, and the networking built into every Mac). I've made some of these mistakes myself, so I'm not saying it's about quality of individuals. It's just that we don't think enough about what we're doing, and before you know it some things are tossed aside that were really good, and replaced them with systems that are grossly inadequate.</description>

This tab, the one I'm writing into now, is for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I have one for my development work, general notes, not project-specific. And tabs for all the projects I've been working on in the last few days or in some cases weeks or months. From a writing standpoint, it doesn't matter whether they're on different sites, the idea of a site is not even in the user interface of my editor. In WordPress it's everything. The usual caveat: unless I'm missing something. I imagine people use browser tabs to work on more than one document at a time? I keep thinking there's a lot of stuff we can do to make WordPress work better for writers, I'm trying to be nice about this, but it doesn't work at all for me as a writer. I want it to work. I still can't believe there aren't a dozen different approaches to writing in WordPress. Seems like a fair amount of innovation is possible. I'm a writer who also is a developer. This has been bugging me for the last year or so. Why do I think WordPress is so important? 1. Obviously it has a huge installed base. If there's an opportunity to create something that even a small number of them would like, it's worth doing. 2. WordPress is the only product out there that supports &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. So If I want lots of outlets for basic text writing, you have to start somewhere. Luckily there's WordPress, sitting there, ready to be recast as a social media app. If you know me, you know I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; puzzles like this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/9577&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about whether a feed reader should support titleless items. It should, without question. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; is very clear. &quot;All elements of an item are optional, however at least one of title or description must be present.&quot; It's how social media sites like Bluesky, Mastodon, et al hook up to the RSS network. Their posts not only don't require titles, they don't allow them, something I'd like to see them ease up on, per &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/#1683634931000&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; is very clear. &quot;All elements of an item are optional, however at least one of title or description must be present.&quot; It's how social media sites like Bluesky, Mastodon, et al hook up to the RSS network. Their posts not only don't require titles, they don't allow them, something I'd like to see them ease up on, per &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/#1683634931000&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>&quot;Let the writer decide&quot;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A simple rule for designers of social web systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let the writer decide if a post needs a title.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't one-size-fits-all. Some posts will have titles, others won't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I think &quot;Let the writer decide&quot; has real potential as a slogan. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The format isn't all that important, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;, what matters is the interop it delivers. The RSS 0.91 to 2.0 thread was what the market built around, because it was promoted to the market and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;held steady&lt;/a&gt; for it. The other thread got bogged down in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web&quot;&gt;academic theory&lt;/a&gt; of how the web should evolve. Content syndication was a real application. That's the story, imho. There was no mention of the NYT in the Wikipedia piece, or Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. Or NPR in re podcasting, yet without the support of these news orgs, and of blogging software, there never would have been an RSS.</description>

Only five players on the court at once, they play both offense and defense, and they aren't wearing armor like football players, you see their faces, whether they're cool or hot, emotional or stoic, up or down. So when your team trades two of its best-known players for three players you've never heard of, to a team that's rebuilding, first you feel sad, and then you wonder what the new teams will be like. One of the traded players, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;Immanuel Quickley&lt;/a&gt;, is a young, happy warrior with a deadly offense, but he was a Knicks bench player because they already had an All-Star quality player at his position, point guard, the quarterback of a basketball team. He led the second unit, and probably had a lot to do with the Knicks' success last year. I watched the Raptors game last night, and while the joy seemed to be gone from his demeanor, he was their starting point guard, and now he gets a chance to prove himself. The Knicks got something they needed, desperately, now that their defensive leader, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson&quot;&gt;Mitchell Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, is injured and out for the season -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby&quot;&gt;OG Anunoby&lt;/a&gt; -- who fit in so well into the starting lineup, in place of the other player the Knicks traded, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett&quot;&gt;RJ Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, who never became the producer we hoped he would. The new Knicks starting five are a much better team than they were before the trade, or so it seems after one game. I admit, I had gotten bored with Knicks this season, but yesterday's game was interesting and exciting, and even better &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/knicks/news/new-york-knicks-2024-game-recap-minnesota-timerwolves-julius-randle-og-anunoby&quot;&gt;the Knicks won&lt;/a&gt;, against one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves&quot;&gt;best teams&lt;/a&gt; in the NBA. Yet we will miss &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;IQ&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and hope for him to have a great career in Toronto and beyond.</description>

			<title>Steamboat Willie and ChatGPT</title>
