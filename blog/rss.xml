It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups&quot;&gt;beaucoups&lt;/a&gt; money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I started replying to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746&quot;&gt;post by Tim Bray&lt;/a&gt; in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character limit, so I moved my act over here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It often only represents a story from one point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the story of RSS. I'm sure you know the story they tell, but there's a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and  Motley Fool, and eventually brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you'd get the idea that the bigco's heroically fought back against what exactly it's not clear. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well it's not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it on my blog (as I'm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is. (Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT made a mistake like that people would be howling. I'm sure Wikipedia is filled with junk like that. Why wouldn't it be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while other sources don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the open web. I don't know why it's better at finding stuff, and also understanding my queries even though they're not rigorously specified, my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which of course they are being. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that's a big difference between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very impatient with them and move on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I'm not here to debate. I don't like online debates. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of relationships.</description>

			<description>I find I look for new stuff in the social web the way I used to look for new stuff on news websites before we got RSS and feed readers. It made a little sense when it was only Twitter. But now I have to check Bluesky, Mastodon and Threads too. It's not just the writing that has to be distributed manually, but also our time as readers. And then there's the question of where you reply if you have something to add.</description>

			<description>If you and I both have accounts on ChatGPT, it would be nice if I could include you in one of my conversations with the bot, and we could explore an idea together with access to all the information we might want to call up. This is what all the chat companies are trying, but the one in the best position to do this is OpenAI, because they have the top rung in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samples.jbpub.com/9781449622213/Chapter19.pdf&quot;&gt;positioning ladder&lt;/a&gt; for AI apps. It's where most of us go for our AI. Like Visicalc which had the top rung of the spreadsheet ladder until Lotus 1-2-3 took over, which was then knocked off the top rung by Excel. This is why they have to move forward aggressively, it's the way tech works. Before too long all the chat apps with have their AI bots in the loop and it will be too late for OpenAI to dominate. But right now they are the obvious choice for this. The place &lt;s&gt;you&lt;/s&gt; &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; go to AI.</description>

			<title>An internet for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The next step in online social media will be group blogs that support the APIs needed to integrate with not only the Fediverse, but other non-AP services that have their own APIs. Each one will have a theme, a voice, not all writers in agreement of course, but sharing a similar perspective, context, point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I could show it what wasn't working with a screen shot. Amazingly it understood and made the connection to the software we were working on, and suggested a modification that made it work properly. This was an important missing bit of functionality, previously you had to explain in words what wasn't working visually. That worked too, but was cumbersome. Much easier to just show it was wrong. And the UI couldn't be simpler. Take the screen shot at paste it into the box where you normally type. It starts analyzing before you press Enter.</description>

			<description>Jon Stewart from this Monday is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmxzQJt80XI&quot;&gt;good to watch&lt;/a&gt; as a reminder of what the press could be doing beyond what Jay Rosen recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice. (Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1798365545106141236&quot;&gt;Jay is on it&lt;/a&gt;.)</description>

Podcasts give you the listener all the power. If you give it up it'll all be Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me messages about all the new &quot;podcasts&quot; they have. I mutter under my breath when I hear this, some expletive I'd rather not repeat. Amazon, the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play fair. You'll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn't be surprised if the users reward you for it.</description>

			<description>What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she makes millions from a medium that doesn't give users much choice (ie MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.</description>

			<description>The test for whether it's a podcast or not is if they say you can get it &quot;Wherever you get your podcasts.&quot; If they can say that, it's a podcast. If you have to get it from Apple or YouTube or whoever, it's not a podcast. That's the rule.</description>

It would be nice if it just said &quot;I don't know&quot; but it's early, and they haven't figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs. I can't wait for the first aha! from a journalist -- who will say this: &quot;Aha!

And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers from totally screwing it up.</description>

			<description>In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After 30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver of knowledge as humans, &lt;i&gt;the machine knows all of it.&lt;/i&gt; And that's just programming. I'm just guessing that everything is that way. You know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/6c5a6426-62f9-48c1-9995-b4ae6f808907&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; in The Matrix Reloaded where we're told &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?si=7GMMS7dBvZW5cOag&amp;t=165&quot;&gt;no one knows&lt;/a&gt; how the technology works. That's where we are now. Spend your whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we didn't know we needed it. That's where we are now, and the journos are sitting on the sidelines hurling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spitballs&quot;&gt;spitballs&lt;/a&gt; at it.</description>

Today I was asked how I feel about podcasting now. Here's what I said. It's still working -- people expect to have choice in where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that's true they will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over tomorrow, I'd be happy with the outcome. It's been over 20 years since we rolled it out, and it's still delivering huge value to lots of people, and isn't controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are no gatekeepers. If only we had been able to keep blogging free of that kind of control, but I have hope there too.</description>

			<description>One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png&quot;&gt;status messages&lt;/a&gt; are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.</description>

			<description>We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode&quot;&gt;pseudocode&lt;/a&gt;. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.</description>

			<description>Another great application for ChatGPT. Try to find a blog post or article about the design of a language that gets to what you want to know without wading through a lot of stuff you don't care about. I got it to explain Swift, Go and Rust quickly. Okay now I know what they're doing. It would have taken me days to assemble this, and I never have that kind of time for such execursions.</description>

And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and &lt;i&gt;isn't that what we want?&lt;/i&gt; To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.</description>

			<description>If you make a podcast client, I'd like to have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;OPML list&lt;/a&gt; of all the feeds I'm subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my feed reader. I'd really like it to go the other way, actually, so I could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It's very important that it use OPML, that's the standard for this stuff. I couldn't possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on these standards. The client I use is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt; which is part of Automattic. BTW, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://editsubscriptionlists.opml.org/&quot;&gt;use Drummer to edit&lt;/a&gt; a subscription list. Its native format is OPML.</description>

It's the story of tech. Something new and explosive comes out, and the journalists feel threatened by it (always, in every way, even when it has nothing to do with them) and a few others (music industry with Napster, artists with ChatGPT) see amateurs invading their previously exclusive space. Truth is these new technologies give new tools for expression of ordinary untrained people. Now we get to have fun with sharing what we see, and maybe the professionals have to reorient themselves to the rest of the world. One thing you can't do and hope not to be left behind, is ignore the new tech, if you want to understand, don't depend on what you read in the news orgs, because they are always full of shit about new tech. You have to go discover it for yourself. And when someone says they're blown away by the new stuff they can do, listen to them, don't argue, try to understand. There's a lot of growth locked up in understanding. So please read the piece, we're at one of those points now wrt to ChatGPT. Sure, it knows a lot of stuff, that's great, but there's also it's ability to listen and understand us. This is what's really new here.</description>

			<description>Sometimes the On This Day feature in Facebook surfaces some questions that should be asked regularly. For example. 1. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02MA2JoTwY1oEYhuxmhuvarmVsaMqX6Gi6dADc3i8C8acFK3j3xNdw6W8GrG2vnoNgl&quot;&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt; what do librarians think of ChatGPT. Only one response. Maybe more this year. If there are any librarians blogging about their experiences with ChatGPT, please send me a link and I will add them to my AI category. If &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; is writing about new discoveries they've made, I want to hear about it.</description>

			<title>Trump today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I try not to post pictures of Trump on this blog since he left office in 2021, but this is too good not to share. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/06/01/trumpOnEscalator.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Pretty sure this is a meme, not an actual New Yorker cover. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
