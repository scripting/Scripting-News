You could register as an independent blogger, and push your writing up to their cloud in real time. And then readers could ask what experts on &lt;i&gt;whatever&lt;/i&gt; think about &lt;i&gt;what just happened&lt;/i&gt; and it would know what your expertise is, and it could build the report also in realtime, in response to a very detailed question you could ask. And you could tell it whether or not you want lies, or if they should omit the lies. Personally I would opt out of the lies, but some people like lies in their news, kind of like menthol in cigarettes. And forget about paying the news orgs. They don't give you a way to opt out of the lies.</description>

			<description>I didn't like the code ChatGPT was writing for me, so I tried it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/new&quot;&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, and the code is much closer to my style. I may try that again. I've heard it's better at supporting code than other chatbots.</description>

			<title>AI deflates the value of expertise</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I didn't read the WSJ story about the deflation of expertise, quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla&quot;&gt;Vinod Khosla&lt;/a&gt;, Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who I know from my time in California. He says AI leads to a deflation of expertise. I agree with him, AI absolutely deflates the value of expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It aggregates all of our knowledge in one place where it's easy to access, about anything you want to know. It answers questions that you can't get any other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think about it. That's not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that didn't have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without television, and I didn't use a computer until I was 18 or use the web until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has been stretched before and I'm well educated and in my work have explored frontiers of knowledge, even so -- this is the most mind-stretching experience I've ever had. Not kidding. And I'm not a VC or prone to overhyping tech.&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is a writing portal?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So far we've only created reading portals. What I want for myself and for you, is a writing portal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A reading portal brings a lot of writers together so you can read them all in one place.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A writing portal is the same idea but in reverse. I write in my portal, and it flows where ever I want it to.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem is the reading portals aren't open to allow this to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all want you to write in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trade Secrets Radio: &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting&quot;&gt;What is podcasting?&lt;/a&gt; This is the exact moment, 9/24/2004, that podcasting got its name and its definition. It's pretty short. We knew what we were doing. We loved what RSS did for news. Now we were doing the same for radio. Not just talking about it, but finally -- doing it. It worked, pretty freaking well. There's a podcast episode to go with it, coming out shortly.</description>

If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.</description>

			<description>I had a dream last night with many of my dead relatives present. We were at some kind of social event. My grandfather had a new wife or girlfriend, but he didn't recognize me, though he pretended to. My mother was far off in the distance taking pictures. I wonder what that means. Some of them &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; dead and gone. I had to remind myself of that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.) My subconscious has a clear idea of who they are/were, only it doesn't register that some of them are gone.</description>

			<description>Here is the monthly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2024/09.opml&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in OPML, for September. I've been systematically creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;this archive&lt;/a&gt; since May 2017. And also have been able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;reconstruct&lt;/a&gt; the archive for most of Scripting News going back to 1994.  I've been doing a lot of work with the contents of this archive in the last month.</description>

			<title>Cross-posting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-posting is here now. I am not surprised &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/croissant-debuts-a-cross-posting-app-for-threads-bluesky-and-mastodon/&quot;&gt;Croissant&lt;/a&gt; is getting such a positive reception. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is where the fediverse will be defined imho, in the intersection between the competing social web services. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll know it's working when they feel they have to match each others' features because with cross-posting their difference in character limits, titles, styling, links etc will be much more visible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Activitypub is too much. Cross-posting is exactly right and here now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
