Biden has a base. He should communicate directly with us. Joe, tell us you saw what we saw. A snake oil salesman. A con man. A loser. A criminal. We heard the tape of him blackmailing the Secretary of State of Georgia. He wanted the military to shoot Black Lives Matter protestors. Did he sell our secrets to Putin and others? He did all kinds of horrible stuff that the press has forgotten to talk about. The biggest problem here isn't Biden's age, though it is a problem, it's the controlling nature of our journalism, and the lack of any oversight. They can't be criticized because all we have are our individual voices, with no organization. We keep paying the price. This podcast is in the form of a voicemail to an old friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who I introduce at the beginning of the podcast. We share the same frustrations, I can see it in his posts on various social media networks. I'd like to elevate our discourse. And in the meantime, imho, it's a pretty good story. &lt;i&gt;10 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Did he sell copies? If so, for how much and to whom. This would make an excellent news story. I imagine President Biden knows all about this, btw.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT supports Amazon better than Amazon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+ChatGPT&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; provides better support for other people's products than they do. For example, I signed up for a trial subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britbox.com/&quot;&gt;BritBox&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon Prime, and a few days later decided I didn't want to continue. Amazon is famous for having terrible docs, in every part of the system. They made it basically impossible for me to quickly find the place where you unsubscribe. Okay so I asked ChatGPT and it knew how to do it, and I was unsubscribed in a few seconds. This feature pays for the whole $20 this month, everything else is a bonus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/30/closeYourEyesAndIllKissYou.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Another example. Something seemed screwed up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+caddy&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful product, makes it super easy to support HTTPS. But the docs were written by programmers, and thus lack a user's perspective. Pretty common thing, and hard to avoid. So I asked ChatGPT questions to help me dig into the problem. It's annoyingly overly verbose, it answers questions I didn't ask, and thus wastes time, but -- in about ten minutes it put something on a checklist which turned out to be the problem. It's hard to debug a system problem you weren't expecting to have. The robot doesn't need to have its memory refreshed, unlike my 69-year-old human brain. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I write these little stories I hope to counter the fear hype out there, because ChatGPT is an amazingly useful breakthrough product. I'm always finding new incredible uses for it. Products like this come along at most every twenty years or so. I've created some good software in my life, but nothing like this. This is like the Beatles or the web. It's that difference-making. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Challenging questions: Why don't journalists cover the Biden base? Do they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think they are the base? I thought they weren't supposed to care who the nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?</description>

It also caused the NYT et al to fully decloak. It was impossible to watch, but it was also honest. We all knew but pretended we didn't that Biden has the kind of trouble he has. We voted for him anyway in 2020, and we will again in 2024. And Trump, what he did was worse than lying, it's a con job, because as soon as he takes office he's going to surrender to Putin. And stop fighting climate change. And destroy what's left of our democracy. And open the concentration camps and make the Jews pay for it. Biden can be president, the news orgs have to decide to let him be and stop trying to control the rest of us. We can make this work. Not the Democrats or Republicans, the Americans.</description>

But if I did, I'd say there's nothing to be done, we just have to let this play out. Even if Biden were to step aside, that would just open the convention and there are lots of Democrats who would see this as their opportunity to be the FDR or Lincoln of the 21st century. There would be no nominee until after the convention, maybe it wouldn't be so bad for the Democrats to have everyone's full attention for a few months. There will be lots of polls, that's for sure. In the meantime, I'm going to try to enjoy the summer, it's beautiful here in the mountains north of the city, and I have some software to finish. And of course I will vote for Democrats straight down the line in the coming election.</description>

			<title>A blogroll lab</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what was out there in blogrolls, so I wrote an app that started from my own blogroll, and looked for feeds I was subscribed to that also had blogrolls, following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/blogroll.opml&quot;&gt;conventions&lt;/a&gt; we outlined in March.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It then starts at each of the blogrolls I found in my list, and did the same thing with them, until I ran out of lists to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the whole thing runs again a few minutes later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It found a bunch of them, so then I threw together a simple user interface that lets you click on the title of a blogroll in a list in the left panel, and view the actual blogroll in the right panel. Here's a screen shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/28/blogrollbrowser.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Screen shot of the Blogroll Browser.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://browse.blogroll.social/?blogrollUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll&amp;blogrollTitle=davewiner%2Fblogroll&quot;&gt;browser.blogroll.social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A caveat -- what you see here is just an experiment. I don't expect this app to be up for any period of time. It's here just to learn from.

			<title>The subscription problem</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/26.html#a225814&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in my new &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/scriptingNewsPodcast/&quot;&gt;podcast-only feed&lt;/a&gt; that explained how RSS had its moment between 2002 and 2006. The big event in 2002 was support from the NY Times, and in 2006 it was the advent of Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/how-the-ny-times-came-to-support-rss/&quot;&gt;NY Times support&lt;/a&gt; gave us the news flow of one of the greatest and most respected news orgs. The entire news publishing industry followed, with incredible speed. It was an amazing time. Woodstock on the web. Everyone who was anyone was there.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inbetween, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; got the rep of being too hard for average people. The &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; reason for this deserved reputation is that subscription was a mess. Every website had to figure it out for themselves, and every feed reader acted as if they were the only feed reader in the world. RSS, which could have been the foundation of something very much like Twitter, never got out the corner of the market where it was totally adored, by people who were motivated enough to tolerate the awful state of subscribing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This was not in any way an insolvable problem. But it required something that the developers of the open web weren't able to do, work together. The W3C and IETF were busy trying to replace RSS, they were offended that it had been developed independently, even though their pitch for XML was that you could develop your own formats. It seemed they didn't believe their own hype? So not only did they not do do anything to help, they actively worked to undermine the success of RSS. That didn't work, fortunately. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;By the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; came along in 2005, it was too late for cooperation. Google dominated, and they didn't want to do anything to build an open news ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/27/followButton.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;When Twitter arrived in 2006, it had control of every aspect of user interface in their corporate platform, and were thus able to completely solve the subscription problem. Every feed had a button that said Follow. Click the button and you were following that feed. The button changed to Unfollow. That is was whole user interface right there. So easy anyone could use it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This story must sound familliar, in 2024 -- because it's all happening &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/468991-all-of-this-has-happened-before-and-it-will-all&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;. This time it's Facebook playing the role of Twitter, and Mastodon playing the role of RSS. And Mastodon has gotten a deserved reputation as being only for techie types. And the solution in 2024 is the same as it was in 2002 -- working together to make subscription easy. A one-click Follow button that works. One button for site-makers to put on their pages. And users leaning back and clicking away without a care in the world (at least about the software).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/26/theFediverseIsDoomedUnlessSubscriptionGetsEasyFast.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; is only 12 minutes long. Go have a listen and then think about whether or not you want to solve this problem for the fediverse. It can include non-ActivityPub systems btw, like Bluesky and even feed readers! We can all share the same subscription protocol. But it cannot be distributed. It must be centralized. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In Twitter there was a button on each feed page that said Subscribe. Click the button and you're subscribed. That's it. May sound like a small matter, but it's not.

			<title>The podcast-only logo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;How the logo for the podcast-only feed was designed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I turned to ChatGPT of course. It came breathtakingly close on the first attempt, but it repeated part of the story. Every time I asked it to fix a problem, it created another problem, and the image brightness was reduced, not just in terms of pixels but also the creativity of the image. Of course it isn't really creative. I know. Yadda yadda. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I got something that I could live with that I liked but was imperfect. I decided that since the motto of my blog is &quot;It's even worse than it appears&quot; that an obvious imperfection is totally consistent with the philosophy, and we move onward. As they say, still diggin!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/25/scriptingNewsInlineImageVersion.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;It's even worse th*@#it appears.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The prompt for the image: &quot;I'm sure you're aware of my blog, Scripting News, scripting.com. I am doing a new podcast feed for the blog. This feed is designed to get through Apple's submission process so it can be listed in their podcast database. One of the requirements is a 3000 by 3000 image that serves as a logo for the podcast. I need something simple and bold that says 'Scripting News podcast' and then 'With Dave Winer and friends' and 'It's even worse than it appears.' On a background of corn fields in Iowa viewed from the air.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C8mUXGiMODB&quot;&gt;Threads could&lt;/a&gt; make it a lot easier for us to cross-post to their system, esp since they say they will support ActivityPub.

It tells the story of RSS as a remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in 1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the &lt;i&gt;entire news world supported RSS.&lt;/i&gt; That's the story. You can write all about who did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn't work with each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course until the real story is out there, we can't learn from it. This is a 14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the sites it points to. And if there's interest I'll happily talk about it in a future podcast.</description>

And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn't work with each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course until the real story is out there, we can't learn from it. This is a 14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the sites it points to. And if there's interest I'll happily talk about it in a future podcast." created="Sun, 23 Jun 2024 20:18:41 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/23/scriptingNewsAd.gif" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="6992914" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23.html#a201841"/>

So while she’s feeling a bit ill under it all is a feeling of splendor and the usual over the top cuteness! :-)</description>

			<title>Comments are often spam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;More and more I see comments, unless explicitly asked for, as spam that I'd disable if I could. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the energy in social networks these days goes into keeping the garbage out of replies. If originators had stronger tools, there would be less work for the platform to do, and overall happier people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, I often limit comments to friends, who don't tend to spam, presumably because we like to stay on good terms, and spam is an imposition, at best, and often insulting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;? That's the kind of bullshit Google does. We don't do that in the open formats and protocols world. What really pains me is they claim to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; Rules for Standards-makers. Imho they do not. Two rules apply. &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000&quot;&gt;Rule #1&lt;/a&gt; says the only reason we do this is interop. It's called Rule #1 for a reason. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;one way&lt;/a&gt; rule a little further down the page. I've seen this happen twice where people say they abide by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;RFSM&lt;/a&gt; but then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the name you've chosen. We've been down this path.

			<description>Now that I'm publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in commercial podcast clients, I'm learning for the first time how they work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that would have worked if I hadn't made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601&quot;&gt;mistake&lt;/a&gt; in GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say &quot;Hey readers dump your cache now, let's start over, because I fcuked up.&quot; It wouldn't have mattered anyway, I'm sure none of them would listen, right?</description>
