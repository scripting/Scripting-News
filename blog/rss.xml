Happy to say the demo was a success. They appeared to love the product, and for the right reasons. It makes WordPress into a fantastic writer's platform. This is what I love to do more than anything. People think I'm most interested in protocols and formats, but that's just part of it, and not the main part. I love making writing tools. I got interested in that in the late 70s working on editors for programming languages, then ran a company that made the same kind of editor, outliners, for writers, and then with Frontier went back to programmers. Now I'm trying something new. I want to create a whole category of editors. Editors where none existed before but should be there. The web. Instead what we have in 2024 is a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt; that hoard your writing making it pointless for developers to compete for writing tools that writers love. So writing on the web remains something that's not for writers. That's freaking stupid! Anyway right in the middle of all this is the perfect product, really a platform -- WordPress. It needs 100 great editors. I'm going to provide the first, and the toolkit to create more. Then Murphy-willing I'm going to create another editor, to show that it can be done. Then I'm going to kick back and smell the roses, a lifetime's work done, so now I can play. It's looking like the plan might just work.</description>

			<description>What &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/elon-musk-donald-trump-economy-stock-market-tariffs-1851684972&quot;&gt;Musk has been saying&lt;/a&gt; is cover for what the oligarchs did to the Soviet Union as it was breaking apart. Only the US has vastly more wealth. And unlike Trump, Musk understands how money works, presumably Putin does too. They want the entire flow of cash that's generated by the US economy to go through them. So &quot;richest man in the world&quot; doesn't begin to cover Musk's ambition. He wants &quot;all the money in the world.&quot; Forget about any benefit from government, that's over. The health care system would fall apart. The situation with abortion is just the beginning. When Musk says it'll come back better after a few years, that's a lie. Something like that never comes back. We've encountered this before, when the Repubs were threatening default.</description>

			<description>Progress on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/30.html#a170135&quot;&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; front. Thanks to all the responses, I've gotten F*cks News out of the startup position, but it still appears in the upper left corner of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/31/noMoreFucksNews.png&quot;&gt;2-by-2 news multiview display&lt;/a&gt;, and thus is the default, and when I launch it I hear them talking which is not pleasant. Further I always have to see what their freaking chyron says, and the commercials from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.10news.com/news/fact-or-fiction/fact-or-fiction-mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-selling-pillows-for-price-linked-to-nazis-and-white-supremacists&quot;&gt;Hitler-fanboi&lt;/a&gt; pillow salesman. Basically I want to be able to see what they're doing &lt;i&gt;when I want to,&lt;/i&gt; but never have it forced on me. Help.</description>

			<title>Bezos blinked</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My op-ed for the Washington Post, if there was such a thing..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't imagine that Bezos cared what subscribers to the Washington Post thought about his decision to cancel their endorsement of VP Harris in the election one week from today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations&quot;&gt;200K people unsubscribed&lt;/a&gt;, and I guess that message got through to him, so he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/&quot;&gt;wrote an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that ran in the Post yesterday, explaining that this was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+principled&quot;&gt;principled&lt;/a&gt; thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If it was really a matter of principle, they wouldn't have chosen this election, and one where his own personal interest was so involved. It doesn't &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; principled, and when you're trying to do something principled, it pretty much has to look that way or you have to conclude that it's bullshit, which it obviously is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/17/dewey.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It's surprising that he cares. The Post was worth $250M when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html&quot;&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; it in 2013, maybe it's worth more than that now, but it's a very small part of his current $205B net worth. If owning the Post would interfere with his other businesses in a negative way, and if the problem could be solved by dropping it, I don't doubt that he would do that. Then why this op-ed? It could be that someone in his family objected, sometimes people react to that in ways that could cost money. It's possible. It's also possible that he's not sure that Trump will win, and being a calculating person, he realizes now that he's created a similar problem for himself if the Democrats win. The Trumps won't care if he lies about the reason, so lying about the reason was the obvious path for him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think what we're really seeing is that owning a high profile news org like the Post isn't something for Mr Bezos. He would probably be better off selling the Post, so he doesn't have to make these kinds of principled bullshit choices, when clearly the only principled thing to do is not abandon American democracy in its hour of greatest need.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If owning the Post would interfere with his other businesses in a negative way, and if the problem could be solved by dropping it, I don't doubt that he would do that. Then why this op-ed? It could be that someone in his family objected, sometimes people react to that in ways that could cost money. It's possible. It's also possible that he's not sure that Trump will win, and being a calculating person, he realizes now that he's created a similar problem for himself if the Democrats win.

It's not the First Amendment or the Second Amendment, it's the whole Constitution. It's the most power every one of us gets. Even the president doesn't have the power of our votes. You don't get a specific result from your vote, that would be the fascism that we're trying to avoid. It's the consenus that build that makes the difference. And Obama is too modest because he made at least a couple of big changes. First, everyone has a right to health insurance now because we elected Obama. That's no small deal, coming from someone who has depended on health insurance to survive, a couple of times. And second, we stirred the racial pot in this country in a positive way. Not to say we got peace and love as a result. Because there are a lot of white folks who don't want that pot stirred. But that was change nonetheless. The only way we get there, and I've said this many times, is by working together. Blame is powerless. Acceptance is powerful.</description>

It's hard to imagine Bezos would lose any money from a complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070715/what-difference-between-writeoff-and-writedown.asp#:~:text=A%20write%2Ddown%20is%20a,removed%20from%20the%20books%20altogether.&quot;&gt;writedown&lt;/a&gt;. Any loss would offset gains he would receive from selling a tiny bit of Amazon stock, it would wash out on his balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can't hurt him with money. In fact I'm pretty sure we can't hurt him in any way. So why not keep the reporters employed, for once the seem to be doing the right thing and keeping us in the loop on why they're doing the awful thing they're doing. Usually we're kept in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Let's bust some new norms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why hasn’t the NY Times run a story that takes Trump at face value and explains to voters what it would be like to live in that United States? It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DBjMQCDsZdy&quot;&gt;An example&lt;/a&gt;. Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade should be imprisoned:  “These people should be put in jail for the way they talk about our judges and justices.” &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A news story on this subject should include calls to all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx&quot;&gt;justices&lt;/a&gt; on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've relied too much on the Democrats to stick their necks out, when in fact all our necks are on the line here. So if you have something to say about this, now is the time to do it. In a couple of weeks it might be too late. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Maybe visions of their own mortality caught up with them and they decided to let Blitzer do what he can to douse the flames.

			<description>I think it's probably too late, anyway. Journalism should have reported, constantly, that the house is on fire. And nothing else. Biden's age didn't enter into it you fools. The much bigger story was and is that Hitler wants to be president, and this time he has a plan. It was true then and it's true now. The next question is what will Biden do if Trump wins. It was tough watching Obama greet Trump at the White House in 2016. I can't see Biden doing that. I wonder what ideas they're workshopping in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_Room&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; Situation Room.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bob Sassone writes via email&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You said on your blog that you can't imagine moving from WordPress because &quot;there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for the writers.&quot; What about Ghost? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bob's site is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bobsassone.com/&quot;&gt;bobsassone.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My response&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sorry it wasn't clear -- but as far as I know, Ghost isn't built on WordPress. It's a completely different product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My writing app runs on WordPress. So you can use it with your existing wordpress.com sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a browser-based JavaScript app that hooks into WordPress via the wpidentity package I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the codebase I've built will support lots of editors built using WordPress as the backend. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/312&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The million-plus Americans Trump killed</title>

Yes, a lot of them died during Biden's tenure too. But I don't think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled, first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter, then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never said geez I was wrong about this, it's a killer, and btw thanks for saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don't tell me I'm biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he's the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven't voted yet, save us from concentration camps and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration&quot;&gt;mass deportation&lt;/a&gt;. One million Americans dead is far too many, let's not try to top that. Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got a notice that Threads had deleted one of my posts because they said it violated their rules. They thought I was claiming to have written something I had not written. I didn't keep the notice (it popped up when I signed on). I shrugged it off when I got it, but then realized that we are very far away from the web. It has been turned into Disneyland where the cops are algorithms and they err on the side of stopping innocent things. I was just passing on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rohan.ga/blog/early-internet/&quot;&gt;link to someone else's blog&lt;/a&gt;, something I thought an informed person would want to know about (that's the idea behind every link I share). We really do need to dig our way out of this hole, again. This is of course no better than Twitter or Facebook. Not a place to get work done.</description>

			<description>It's amazing that the million-plus Americans who died from Covid during Trump's tenure aren't even mentioned as a campaign issue. Maybe people don't want to be reminded of those dark days.</description>

			<title>I'm sticking with WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm continuing to develop on WordPress. I see the opportunity regardless of what else is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- and that basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don't think that's very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father's memorial site, for example. Things would have to get incomprehensibly bad for me to consider moving it and where exactly would I move it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for the writers. I think I'm pretty much alone working in this area. And maybe people need some good news? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My new product is a medium size writing tool. Less than a full word processor and more than a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt;. I think there are a lot of WordPress users who will like it. And I think there's a chance they might notice it. So I'm going all the way with this one. I may lose the bet, but wtf, let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I didn't think the Mets would make it through any of the hurdles, making the playoffs, and beating the Brewers and Phillies. That was amazing. And the energy of this team, their humor and inventiveness, professionalism and perseverance. The Mets of 2024 were a great team, and they give us something to look forward to in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say Mets pitchers walked too many Dodgers, but the walks were a result of discipline on the part of the Dodgers hitters. Most pitchers throw a lot of crap, and the hitters swing at it. The Dodgers are more discerning. If the Mets pitchers had thrown strikes they would have hit home runs. It's another way of saying that the Dodgers, no matter how much we despise them, this year at least, were the better team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there is a silver lining. I wasn't sure I wanted the Mets to beat the Dodgers once we knew the team from the &quot;other&quot; league was going to be the Jankees. Last time the Mets played them in the World Series, they beat us in Shea Stadium and as a result we had to tear it down and start over. I don't think any of us wanted that, or even to risk having to tear down Citi Field. I don't like to be reminded that the Jankees even exist, much less be forced to watch them play. And honestly between the Dodgers and the other NY team, I want them &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; to lose. Is there any way to arrange that? I don't even want to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway thanks to the Mets for being such a wonderful team, a constant inspiration. So onward. Next year. And now..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks begin their season &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/sport/basketball/article/3283231/nba-season-opens-boston-celtics-eyeing-dynasty-and-knicks-chasing-first-title-1973&quot;&gt;tomorrow night&lt;/a&gt; in Boston against the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

So I want &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. Mobile people either don't care or don't want it. So it stands to reason we need a different user interface. We can use the same network, we just need a different UI for editing. Since the twitter-like systems already carry links to stories written by people on desktops, there's room in their pipes for our writing too. And it can work more efficiently if the stories are part of the message as opposed to living off-site. Think of it as a web of writing. A writer's web that also carries short messages.</description>

So I want &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. Mobile people either don't care or don't want it. So it stands to reason we need a different user interface. We can use the same network, we just need a different UI for editing. Since the twitter-like systems already carry links to stories written by people on desktops, there's room in their pipes for our writing too. And it can work more efficiently if the stories are part of the message as opposed to living off-site. Think of it as a web of writing. A writer's web that also carries short messages." created="Sun, 20 Oct 2024 17:46:18 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/20.html#a174618"/>

			<description>I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/20/warningMuskCouldPushTrumpOverTheTop.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; this morning about the reality of Musk owning Twitter, which is now completely settling in. He might have enough influence on the election to push Trump over. He wins even if Trump loses, he gets a moon mission project to boot up a Musk Party. It's coming for sure, either way. Probably will pick up what's left over after Trump, who clearly is losing it, and even if he's president, someone else will be pulling the strings. I can't imagine the billionaire will let JD Vance do it. And by &quot;billionaire&quot; I mean Musk.</description>

			<description>A second elimination game for the Mets tonight. I almost don't want the Mets to win, because the World Series opponent from the &quot;other&quot; league are the Janks from the Bronx. I love the Bronx. That's about all I have to say about that at this time.</description>

Those are such basic things.&quot; They got what they wanted, they got the users and press to relax because they’re Facebook who we know, but this is different, it’s the fediverse. And they got Eugen and others to validate them. This always works, standard tech playbook. they give up nothing, then the priority changes. I don't like being right. But they're never going to change in Silicon Valley. They do what works, and take advantage of newcomers who want to believe.</description>

			<description>It's possible the Dodgers let the Mets win as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/18.html#a144749&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to yesterday, but it's also possible the Mets just &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/live/dodgers-vs-mets-new-york-bats-come-alive-in-game-5-sending-series-back-to-los-angeles-201027428.html&quot;&gt;crushed&lt;/a&gt; the Dodgers, but either way, the Mets are still in it. The series is now 3-2, and returns to Los Angeles tomorrow. So we don't have to tear down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field&quot;&gt;Citi Field&lt;/a&gt; after all. If the Dodgers win it'll be in their own stadium. The Mets were magnificent! Absolutely inspiring. A three-run home run by Alonso started things off. Everyone got on base. Doubles and triples. It wasn't without the concern that our wonderful and lovable Mets would do the usual Mets thing and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they held out. The final score was 12-6. We're still in it. Lets go Mets!</description>

			<description>Bloggers, here's an idea. When you write a piece you're proud of, end it with a sentence like this: &quot;And that's why I have a blog.&quot; It plants a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We've had a lot of mud slung at us, let's start undoing that.</description>

If I were the Dodgers, I'd expect the Mets to win tonight, and the Dodgers will probably begrudgingly go along with it. Otherwise we'd have to destroy Citi Field as we did when the Yankees celebrated their World Series victory in 2000 on the field of Shea Stadium. I was actual there the night that will live in infamy. Back then at first I objected to the destruction of our shrine to the glory of past Mets teams, but then I realized we could never again rise to the peak of Mets philosophy in a chapel so soiled by the infidels. So if you don't mind Dodgers, we'd like to keep Citi Field, so we won't object if you let our Metsies win tonight's game.

			<description>There's this great story in the Fargo TV series where one of the villains says there's a point when an animal that has been captured, relaxes when it realizes that it is no longer a being and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1msLSfeSc&amp;t=25s&quot;&gt;has become food&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;At some level food it knows it's food.&quot; Evolution has been kind to us that way. At what point in last night's game did you realize that the Mets were no longer a baseball team and had become food?</description>

			<title>Oh Sweet Jesus, Please God, No</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Will the NYT make it through the election without running an editorial that says &lt;i&gt;clearly&lt;/i&gt; if we elect this mad king fascist and give him nukes and our military, and our industrial might, and what remains of our virtue, then we deserve the hell that will rain down on us. If this were a Hollywood movie, we'd be waiting for the climax, but I have a feeling they will exit existence with a whimper. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/18/ohSweetJesusNo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Are we in a loop??&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
