Where did you learn to ignore the feelings you must have when you see people, fellow human beings, attacked with such cruelty? Snap out of it, if you have any empathy left, or any love for our country. Tell your representatives to step in and stop this, and no excuses, Democrat or Republican, I don't care.</description>

			<description>Is there any circumstance where &quot;Sorry for the inconvenience&quot; isn't the wrong thing to say? Maybe I didn't even notice, or if I did, maybe I didn't care. And what if the results were more than inconvenient? What if someone died! Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll say. I like &lt;i&gt;still diggin&lt;/i&gt; the best. It says yes we suck, and we know it, but we're trying to suck less.</description>

			<title>Think different about WordPress, cont'd</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a continuation of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in August 2025.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/wordpressorg.opml&quot;&gt;this.how doc&lt;/a&gt; about getting WordLand to run on sites that don't run on WordPress.com or have Jetpack installed. What this means is that their sites are accessible through the fantastic wpcom API, and with that API I have been able to build a very nice writers' workspace for WordPress sites. I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that's not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is &quot;self-hosted sites&quot; because you could have a hosting service that doesn't install Jetpack. WordPress could be used for things that are quite different from the way it's used today. Important point.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I sent links to that post to two people, and encouraged them to pass it along, as a way of starting a discussion -- how are we going to get WordLand running on those &quot;other&quot; sites. And we need names for lots of things, but first we have to get the software working the way we want it to, then the naming will be more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Herve has already written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://herve.bzh/wordland-on-self-hosted-sites/&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; (as I asked him to). As always, very helpful. But I want to push back on the way he frames the project -- as if it's up to me to do this work, and that I dispute. It think it's up to us. WordLand isn't just a product, it's a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To make WordPress a fantastic platform for developers who want to build on its ability to write and read and link together writing and reading on the freaking web. That's why it's so important to understand what the web is and what it's capabilities are. We've been missing some of the big stuff since the big silos took over. I want, before I hang up my hat, to fix that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to outline here how we start, so it's documented so more people will see it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have written a package, MIT-licensed, with an awkward name for historic reasons called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpIdentity&lt;/a&gt;. It started off as just a simple way to use WordPress identity with FeedLand because it made sense to do it a couple of years ago because Twitter was destroying the utility of their API, and we needed a new way to do identity. So I stopped everything and implemented both email identity and WordPress identity, or more specifically, wordpress.com identity. This leaves out all the wordpress sites that you can't log onto this way. Not a good situation, I don't like it because I want WordPress to be one large happy family of users and developers. So that's what I'm seeking to instigate here. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then wpIdentity grew and grew. At first it supported all the endpoints in the wpcom API, and made it possible to build WordLand, which itself &lt;i&gt;only communicates to WordPress via wpIdentity.&lt;/i&gt;  And later when I needed user-specific storage that is not part of the WordPress API, I built a very nice little storage system, it's efficient, highly scalable, and (I think) well debugged. If you read my initial &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;Think Different&lt;/a&gt; piece you'll see it gets a mention in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a141421&quot;&gt;this part&lt;/a&gt;. Storage, we will find out, is the big missing piece in the web, has always been the missing piece, the thing that keeps us from having a real developer community of web apps. How do I know? Because I'm a freaking developer. I don't work at a company that can insulate me from this need. That's why I see this need and so many others don't.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now here's something else that's cool. I didn't stop with wpIdentity, I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;JavaScript function&lt;/a&gt; that simplifies the wpcom interface for people writing browser-based JavaScript apps. It radically simplifies it. I didn't invent this way of doing it, someone at Facebook did, as far as I'm concerned. We may not like Facebook the company or the boss man, but they have employed some brilliant programmers over the years. I think this idea came from the developers of FriendFeed, but I could be wrong. What they did was take the interface code every app developer has to do, and made &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; the API. I remember when I first saw it in 2013, it blew me away. It took me a full month to build support for Twitter in my app, but it only two days to do it in Facebook. I did one of those for WordPress. It's part of wpIdentity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;. Please if you're a contributor to wordpress.org -- study that thing, because we're going to be working on that code -- together. This is where the &quot;we&quot; part of it starts. But there's more.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to read the code of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;api2.js&lt;/a&gt; to understand how it works, there's an even easier way to do it -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo&quot;&gt;wpEditorDemo&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple browser-based editor that does what WordLand does, without all the flourish. Bare bones. Also MIT-licensed. Nothing but what's required. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo?tab=readme-ov-file#demo&quot;&gt;try it out&lt;/a&gt; if you have one or more qualifying sites (either on wordpress.com or having Jetpack installed). The project we need to do is this -- &lt;i&gt;make wpEditDemo work on any WordPress site, no matter where it's hosted.&lt;/i&gt;  And that's going to be done by extending api2.js. That's where the differences will be encapsulated, and above that level, in wpEditDemo and WordLand and all its competitors, nothing changes. This project may be complicated or simple, or somewhere inbetween, but imho this has to be done. And this is the first place I want to join the open source community for WordPress. After talking with Jon, I became optimistic about this happening sooner than later. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I zoomed through all this and more with Jonathan on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2026/01/13.html#a224042&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. This is what I want to talk about at WordCamp Europe later this year (I have submitted an application). I wanted to show Jon and a few other people I met in Ottawa in October how the pieces fit together. But zooming is the right word, Jon was ahead of me at every step, he just understood what I was showing him. I was blown away -- because this had never happened before with the architecture I had built. Not because it's so complex, it isn't -- it's all about simplifying things, with lots of factoring, finding a repeating pattern and then locking it down in code, so no one has to ever worry about the complexity again. I think it was hard for people to see because they aren't expecting it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's where I'm going to leave it for now. I suggest if you have a response or comment, please put it on your blog and send me a link. We're going to create new ways to link blog posts together, but for now we'll do it by hand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Hat-tip to Matt Mullenweg for building WordPress, and for having the idea that Tumblr could be rebuilt on top of WordPress. When he announced they were going to do that I knew I was on the right track. We were thinking about WordPress the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If people have a hard time understanding how I could do this -- remember: 1. I've had a lot of time. 2. I understand WordPress at a deep level. 3. I'm good at building and selling APIs, I've been fairly successful at it.

			<source:markdown>_This is a continuation of a [piece](http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html) I wrote in August 2025._&#10;&#10;![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png)Yesterday I wrote a [this.how doc](https://this.how/wordland/wordpressorg.opml) about getting WordLand to run on sites that don't run on WordPress.com or have Jetpack installed. What this means is that their sites are accessible through the fantastic wpcom API, and with that API I have been able to build a very nice writers' workspace for WordPress sites. I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that's not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is &quot;self-hosted sites&quot; because you could have a hosting service that doesn't install Jetpack. WordPress could be used for things that are quite different from the way it's used today. Important point.&#10;&#10;I sent links to that post to two people, and encouraged them to pass it along, as a way of starting a discussion -- how are we going to get WordLand running on those &quot;other&quot; sites. And we need names for lots of things, but first we have to get the software working the way we want it to, then the naming will be more obvious.&#10;&#10;Jeremy Herve has already written a [response](https://herve.bzh/wordland-on-self-hosted-sites/) (as I asked him to). As always, very helpful. But I want to push back on the way he frames the project -- as if it's up to me to do this work, and that I dispute. It think it's up to us. WordLand isn't just a product, it's a challenge.&#10;&#10;*   To make WordPress a fantastic platform for developers who want to build on its ability to write and read and link together writing and reading on the freaking web. That's why it's so important to understand what the web is and what it's capabilities are. We've been missing some of the big stuff since the big silos took over. I want, before I hang up my hat, to fix that.&#10;&#10;I'm going to outline here how we start, so it's documented so more people will see it too.&#10;&#10;*   I have written a package, MIT-licensed, with an awkward name for historic reasons called [wpIdentity](https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity). It started off as just a simple way to use WordPress identity with FeedLand because it made sense to do it a couple of years ago because Twitter was destroying the utility of their API, and we needed a new way to do identity. So I stopped everything and implemented both email identity and WordPress identity, or more specifically, wordpress.com identity. This leaves out all the wordpress sites that you can't log onto this way. Not a good situation, I don't like it because I want WordPress to be one large happy family of users and developers. So that's what I'm seeking to instigate here.&#10;*   Then wpIdentity grew and grew. At first it supported all the endpoints in the wpcom API, and made it possible to build WordLand, which itself _only communicates to WordPress via wpIdentity._ And later when I needed user-specific storage that is not part of the WordPress API, I built a very nice little storage system, it's efficient, highly scalable, and (I think) well debugged. If you read my initial [Think Different](http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html) piece you'll see it gets a mention in [this part](http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a141421). Storage, we will find out, is the big missing piece in the web, has always been the missing piece, the thing that keeps us from having a real developer community of web apps. How do I know? Because I'm a freaking developer. I don't work at a company that can insulate me from this need. That's why I see this need and so many others don't.&#10;*   Now here's something else that's cool. I didn't stop with wpIdentity, I made a [JavaScript function](https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js) that simplifies the wpcom interface for people writing browser-based JavaScript apps. It radically simplifies it. I didn't invent this way of doing it, someone at Facebook did, as far as I'm concerned. We may not like Facebook the company or the boss man, but they have employed some brilliant programmers over the years. I think this idea came from the developers of FriendFeed, but I could be wrong. What they did was take the interface code every app developer has to do, and made _that_ the API. I remember when I first saw it in 2013, it blew me away. It took me a full month to build support for Twitter in my app, but it only two days to do it in Facebook. I did one of those for WordPress. It's part of wpIdentity. [Here it is](https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js). Please if you're a contributor to wordpress.org -- study that thing, because we're going to be working on that code -- together. This is where the &quot;we&quot; part of it starts. But there's more.&#10;*   You don't _have_ to read the code of [api2.js](https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js) to understand how it works, there's an even easier way to do it -- [wpEditorDemo](https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo). It's a simple browser-based editor that does what WordLand does, without all the flourish. Bare bones. Also MIT-licensed. Nothing but what's required. You can [try it out](https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo?tab=readme-ov-file#demo) if you have one or more qualifying sites (either on wordpress.com or having Jetpack installed). The project we need to do is this -- _make wpEditDemo work on any WordPress site, no matter where it's hosted._ And that's going to be done by extending api2.js. That's where the differences will be encapsulated, and above that level, in wpEditDemo and WordLand and all its competitors, nothing changes. This project may be complicated or simple, or somewhere inbetween, but imho this has to be done. And this is the first place I want to join the open source community for WordPress. After talking with Jon, I became optimistic about this happening sooner than later.&#10;*   I zoomed through all this and more with Jonathan on [Tuesday](http://scripting.com/2026/01/13.html#a224042). This is what I want to talk about at WordCamp Europe later this year (I have submitted an application). I wanted to show Jon and a few other people I met in Ottawa in October how the pieces fit together. But zooming is the right word, Jon was ahead of me at every step, he just understood what I was showing him. I was blown away -- because this had never happened before with the architecture I had built. Not because it's so complex, it isn't -- it's all about simplifying things, with lots of factoring, finding a repeating pattern and then locking it down in code, so no one has to ever worry about the complexity again. I think it was hard for people to see because they aren't expecting it.&#10;&#10;That's where I'm going to leave it for now. I suggest if you have a response or comment, please put it on your blog and send me a link. We're going to create new ways to link blog posts together, but for now we'll do it by hand.&#10;&#10;PS: Hat-tip to Matt Mullenweg for building WordPress, and for having the idea that Tumblr could be rebuilt on top of WordPress. When he announced they were going to do that I knew I was on the right track. We were thinking about WordPress the same way.&#10;&#10;PPS: If people have a hard time understanding how I could do this -- remember: 1. I've had a lot of time. 2. I understand WordPress at a deep level. 3. I'm good at building and selling APIs, I've been fairly successful at it. And even better, the WordPress community has been a very good caretaker of this work. They support a remarkable amount of it, and it all still works, and they often wonder why the rest of the world doesn't love it like they do. I feel the same damn way. ;-)&#10;&#10;![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/16/einsteinThinkDifferent.png)&#10;&#10;PPPS: And thanks to Steve Jobs for thinking differently.&#10;&#10;![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/16/ogilvy.png)&#10;&#10;PPPPS: And to VW for thinking small.</source:markdown>

I remembered there was a desk accessory on the original Mac that used this approach, and I've wanted that icon for a long time, and today I thought to ask ChatGPT to look into it for me, I had previously been relying on Google search, and it found what I was looking for and a lot of great history sites with details. I'm going to document the thread including some descriptions written by ChatGPT which I will label. Everything not labled like that is from me. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the first question I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There was an alarm desk accessory on the original Macintosh in 1984. It had a nice mailbox flag affordance. When the flag is up, the contents of the DA are hidden, flip it down to reveal what was hidden. Can you find me a writeup of this or screen shot. It might have been a different desk accessory or a different year.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT's response&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What you’re remembering is almost certainly the Alarm Clock desk accessory from the early Mac System Software (System 1 era and later). A small “lever/flag” control would toggle the window between a compact view (just time) and an expanded view that revealed the date/time/alarm-setting controls—very much like a mailbox-flag affordance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/12/macDesktop1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The flag icon is on second box in the second row.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Links (via ChatGPT)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/magazines/washington_apple_journal/washingtonapplepijournal198404.pdf&quot;&gt;Washington Apple Pi Journal&lt;/a&gt; (April 1984) describes the Alarm Clock DA and explicitly calls out the “lever” that opens the “Change” portion of the window (“Pointing to the lever and clicking…” reveals additional areas).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hmug.org/Docs/HMUG_Handbook-2_92wd4.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;&gt;Huntsville Macintosh Users Group&lt;/a&gt; handbook glossary defines the “lever” as the little arm in the Alarm Clock DA that, when clicked, makes additional panels appear for setting time/date/alarm.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lowendmac.com/2005/innovative-macintosh-system-1-0/&quot;&gt;Low End Mac&lt;/a&gt; has a System 1 desk accessories writeup (including Alarm Clock) and includes a screenshot of the DA.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/69652b3b-6060-8012-b9d6-d53b92886725&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to the archive of the full conversation I had with ChatGPT.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we had a conversation about the history, which I asked ChatGPT for a two-paragraph summary, below.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Susan Kare’s work on the original Macintosh wasn’t just visually elegant, it was foundational: she showed that icons could be humane, legible, and generous to the user. The mailbox-flag affordance in the Alarm Desk Accessory is a perfect example—simple, memorable, and instantly understandable, yet rich with meaning. It wasn’t decorative; it taught the interface how to communicate. That clarity came from Kare’s rare combination of artistic intuition and respect for the people using the machine. Just as important was her personal generosity: again and again, she contributed work freely, trusting that good ideas grow stronger when shared. Many of us benefited directly from that spirit, receiving world-class design not as a transaction, but as a gift.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Carrying these designs forward—faithfully, with credit—is one way creativity survives across generations. Reusing an icon like the mailbox flag isn’t nostalgia; it’s continuity. It acknowledges that great interface ideas don’t expire, and that today’s software is part of a long conversation rather than a clean break from the past. By preserving the pixel logic, the affordance, and the attribution to Susan Kare, we honor both the craft and the culture that produced it. That’s how design knowledge persists: not by constant reinvention, but by respectful reuse, gratitude, and the quiet understanding that we’re building on work someone once chose to share.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I inititally wrote this up as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0PgonZdpC1sZSZU6JcQBYmgXVx6eUHFdWPmsUTzSmw3VZfjirVVfreR2Mfnn9gSD7l&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook where a lot of us oldtime Mac people still congregate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The mailbox-flag affordance in the Alarm Desk Accessory is a perfect example—simple, memorable, and instantly understandable, yet rich with meaning. It wasn’t decorative; it taught the interface how to communicate. That clarity came from Kare’s rare combination of artistic intuition and respect for the people using the machine. Just as important was her personal generosity: again and again, she contributed work freely, trusting that good ideas grow stronger when shared. Many of us benefited directly from that spirit, receiving world-class design not as a transaction, but as a gift.&#10;*   Carrying these designs forward—faithfully, with credit—is one way creativity survives across generations. Reusing an icon like the mailbox flag isn’t nostalgia; it’s continuity. It acknowledges that great interface ideas don’t expire, and that today’s software is part of a long conversation rather than a clean break from the past. By preserving the pixel logic, the affordance, and the attribution to Susan Kare, we honor both the craft and the culture that produced it. That’s how design knowledge persists: not by constant reinvention, but by respectful reuse, gratitude, and the quiet understanding that we’re building on work someone once chose to share.&#10;&#10;PS: I inititally wrote this up as a [thread](https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0PgonZdpC1sZSZU6JcQBYmgXVx6eUHFdWPmsUTzSmw3VZfjirVVfreR2Mfnn9gSD7l) on Facebook where a lot of us oldtime Mac people still congregate.</source:markdown>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://johnjohnston.info/blog/watching-wordland-demo-2026/&quot;&gt;John Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime friend of UserLand and my newer products, asks how WordLand connects with FeedLand. Two ways. 1. FeedLand has an API, still working on it, but it will be public. 2. FeedLand has an outbound &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;websockets interface&lt;/a&gt;, which is already public, so any can use it as their feed reader, and get notice of new items and updates to existing items as soon as FeedLand has the info. And if the site uses rssCloud, as WordPress does and has since 2009, the notices are instantaneous. So to the extent people thought RSS is a slow protocol, it's not. It runs at the speed of the internet. And FeedLand is all about RSS, as you know.</description>

			<description>Trump is president the same way people who do vibe coding are developers. I always thought he'd be much happier playing president on TV instead of actually being president. And people would think about this stuff more rationally if it were a TV show like Pluribus or Severance. Why did they &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; do what they did? Or the way we talk about the Mets or the Knicks and their various foibles. It's funny people have a clarity about fictional stuff that they don't have for real-world things like war, health insurance, the cost of eggs and gestapo tactics.</description>

			<title>Was the ICE murder pre-calculated?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When there's breaking news these days I check Fox News in addition to CNN, MSNOW, BBC, PBS. The best are the last two. But last night night when everyone was fixated on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of Renee Nicole Good, the woman who was killed in cold blood, on video, by a masked ICE thug, I wondered what Fox was saying. They were showing the actual video over and over like the other networks. Their words were what Trump was saying, but they didn't hide what actually happened, at least as long as it's news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I wondered how much this was pre-calculated. It clearly doesn't hurt ICE to signal that they're killing US citizens in the US with impunity. Next time will be soon, and it will be more than one dead, and maybe they'll be kids. What makes me think this was not planned by the higher-ups is that they killed a middle-aged white woman, mother of 3,, who writes poetry. Not a very likely cartel leader or narco-terrorist. There were dolls in the glove compartment of the car. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every indication is that she was just afraid and trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We also remember that in the aftermath of Jan 6, private texts from the top people at Fox indicated they were scared and appalled like most other relatively sane Americans. What had happened then was unthinkable. Well, what happened yesterday was just as unthinkable. Shocking. Makes you wonder what's next. Get ready, we're going to see a lot of ugliness now, hard to comprehend, hard to accept. We still have a skeletal democracy, and ICE isn't fully staffed yet (they have new billions of dollars to spend).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/pfbid035Dzpcd13T73crrWxC85U6GMf1UH2qH148cJuYvEfHMzCUjMDypyha9vbrrMSKEDJl?comment_id=1185132377083238&amp;notif_id=1767891365875871&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;Dan Conover said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;This is what the collapse of the rules-based order looks like.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I responded: &quot;Or it's a test of it. The guy wasn't very well disguised, I think he will be identified if he hasn't already been identified. Will he be arrested and tried? If yes, then we just validated the rule-based order. If no, we're fucked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Or even better the state of Minnesota could go to court and sue ICE to get their officers to wear identifying information, and no masks. For just this reason. And then here's an arrest warrant for the guy who fired his gun 3 times at the head of a 37-year old mom who writes poetry and drives an SUV with teddy bears in the glove compartment. In other words I'm not sure this was intentional (on behalf of ICE), and I think they may have to turn this guy over, otherwise someone is getting impeached. The video is too compelling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When it first came out &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; was a total godsend. It took something every developer of graphic apps had to struggle with, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYey8ntlK_E&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; basically &quot;I can do that.&quot; They had a growing set of standard icons, it got better with every version. But some special icons haven't appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Font%20Awesome%22&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. There was a great icon on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://99percentinvisible.org/article/designed-with-kare-influential-macintosh-graphics-of-early-apple-computers/&quot;&gt;original Mac&lt;/a&gt;, for a desk accessory, I don't remember which one. It was a flag, like the flag on a mailbox. If you put a piece of mail in the box you raise the flag, that way the postman knows to stop. When they pick up the mail they flip the flag down. On the early Mac it took an app that was wide and short, and made it wide and tall, revealing the ideas and data it kept for you. You can still have the icon, using ChatGPT. Have it generate your own icon using SVG. You get something every bit as good as a Font Awesome icon. So you can be creative in a new way.

			<source:markdown>![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/07/mailbox.png)Another incredible use-case for ChatGPT. When it first came out [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was a total godsend. It took something every developer of graphic apps had to struggle with, and [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYey8ntlK_E) basically &quot;I can do that.&quot; They had a growing set of standard icons, it got better with every version. But some special icons haven't appeared in [Font Awesome](https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Font%20Awesome%22). There was a great icon on the [original Mac](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/designed-with-kare-influential-macintosh-graphics-of-early-apple-computers/), for a desk accessory, I don't remember which one. It was a flag, like the flag on a mailbox. If you put a piece of mail in the box you raise the flag, that way the postman knows to stop. When they pick up the mail they flip the flag down. On the early Mac it took an app that was wide and short, and made it wide and tall, revealing the ideas and data it kept for you. You can still have the icon, using ChatGPT. Have it generate your own icon using SVG. You get something every bit as good as a Font Awesome icon. So you can be creative in a new way.

That could be a new feature in WordPress, or the decision whether or not to display it could be up to the reader app (in this case Bluesky). If it were up to the reader we might need a way to signal that to the reader from the CMS. In the new WordLand, we use the image as an icon. It's completely wrong to use it as an OG Metadata image in Bluesky -- realllly embarrassing (&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/07/bigAppleUgh.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;).</description>

			<description>Problem with ChatGPT is that it thinks you always want to know everything about all the options, no matter how convoluted they are, based on incorrect assumptions about what you're doing. You ask a simple question with a simple answer and they write you a four page briefing on everything. At least they do seem to give you the correct answer up front. They ought to work on making these things manageable, and btw for these reasons I believe they must write the most shitty code when they're left to write the whole thing. If they have a different better mode, please let me talk to that one! :-)</description>

			<description>I did a long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6N9wOaGI4&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; yesterday with a narrative about where WordLand is going. The audio quality sucks. And at the beginning I said I wasn't going to narrate, but I couldn't help myself. Turn the volume way up. WordLand has become a new kind of feed reader, it's totally building off FeedLand, I love the idea of apps building on other apps. It's exactly the kind of software we predicted, long before MCP's, with Frontier back in the 80s, 90s and 00s.</description>

			<description>Just heard an ad on WNYC-FM saying we should share news with them. That's a milestone. First time I've ever heard NPR say our purpose was anything other than giving them money. They could go even further -- support blogs and podcasts that cover the NYC area.</description>

			<description>I never was very good with PhotoShop and other bitmap image apps. Now I use ChatGPT, I just tell it what I want, like remove this bit and that bit, and it just freaking does it. This is how computers were meant to work. That's how I did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/05/peets.png&quot;&gt;Peet's logo&lt;/a&gt; in the image in the previous post. And btw the people who are down on ChatGPT being used for graphics and videos are full of shit about it not having value. Some of us don't have the skill yet still would like to illustrate our ideas with images and videos. For those of us, the AI apps are a godsend. They're also pretty good I hear at providing medical advice. I've been using it for that pretty extensively. At my age health is not something you can ignore, and it helps to be informed. And with the healthcare system these days in the US being so limited, you don't really get to have a relationship with your doctor as we did in the past, so guess what, I bet ChatGPT is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/well/ai-chatbot-doctors-health-care-advice.html&quot;&gt;saving some lives&lt;/a&gt;. So if you don't like being seriously wrong about new tech, you should start seeing the advantages, not just the belief that it cancels freedom. If it does, and so far I don't see it, there's a lot of good that that compensates. There are always tradeoffs in evolution.</description>

			<description>Do you feel powerless to communicate online unless it serves the interests of the people who own the networks you post to? Why not own your own means of distribution, managed as a co-op, and only responsible to you, as a member and customer. No VC, no billionaire, no government control.</description>

Wars are easy to start, hard to end. They actually called Bush a &quot;visionary&quot; on MSNBC, they were so in awe of his courage, but that would end soon. And this time, no doubt Trump started the war with the approval of China and Russia, which will be left alone by the US in their conquest of Taiwan and Ukraine. Leaders of smaller countries must be wondering where they can hide from this. A very depressing moment.
