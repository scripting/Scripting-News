			<description>I wish I could send ChatGPT a pointer to a page I'm working on and ask it questions about my CSS. Or imagine ChatGPT running in Node, supervising my server app, looking for problems, odd usage patterns, and later looking for optimizations. And that's just the beginning.</description>

			<description>I saw these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YL76VSR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Sony buds&lt;/a&gt; advertised and I had to try them. They're now my favorite way to listen to music and podcasts. Most ear buds in my experience don't do very well with bass, and I love music with a strong beat. Sony makes great inexpensive headphones.</description>

			<description>Experiments. I pasted the URL of a Mastodon post into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C4_DVOQrJ58&quot;&gt;Threads post&lt;/a&gt;. I was kind of expecting it would use the power of federation to just get the post and put it in Threads. I asked a similar question on Mastodon, pasting the URL of a Threads post into a Mastodon &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112162971603703956&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Maddow didn't go far enough</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/26/maddow.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I don't usually watch Maddow on Monday nights. I lost my faith in her when she went after Facebook a few years ago, not that Facebook didn't deserve her attention, but her arguments while condemning them were exaggerated. I knew the facts, she left out important details. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She steered viewers into believing things that weren't true. Didn't exactly lie, but pretty close. I figured if she does that for stories I know, then she's probably doing it other times when I wasn't so well informed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/03/25/knicks-donte-divincenzo-franchise-record-pistons-nba/&quot;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt; were blowing out the Pistons on the next channel over, and I had tuned in Jen Psaki, who as luck would have it, at the exact moment I switched, was explaining how the fact that she served in the Biden Administration before joining MSNBC was very different from the controversy over Ronna McDaniel, who Maddow went on to explain was basically a terrorist and traitor and Trump co-conspirator (not just an enabler), and not in a war that was over, but one that was still being fought, and not insignificant because this fascist movement has control of one of the two major parties in the US and McDaniel was instrumental in that. There are good arguments that she should be in a prisoner of war camp, not employed by one of America's major news networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That NBC hired McDaniel as a contributor says something awful about Maddow's employer. And Maddow, if she has any details on that, isn't saying what they are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've had this problem with other reporters in the past whose owners were caught up in some controversy that made them newsworthy. The reporters refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is where journalism goes wrong imho. Maddow &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; know the details, and if she does, she is obligated to share them, because they are significant, and go to how much trust any of us should give to any news coming to us from NBC. Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It's similar to the &quot;news&quot; she reported on Facebook, except now instead of steering us to believe lies, she's holding it back, and instead of it being about one very powerful social media company, it's about the future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn't know, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something&quot;&gt;Upton Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; once said: “It is difficult to get a [person] to understand something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.” &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't blame Maddow for liking her job. But as a reporter, there are more and more reasons not to trust her and esp to not trust the company that employs her. When it was obvious she wasn't going to tell us the story behind McDaniel's hiring, or even name the people responsible for it, I switched back to the Knicks, where at least I think I understand who they are and what they're trying to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/240326/p49#a240326p49&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;: MSNBC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/03/26/nbc-news-ronna-mcdaniel-commentator&quot;&gt;backed down&lt;/a&gt; on hiring McDaniel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Created by the showrunners for Game of Thrones based on a much-loved series of science fiction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765377063/ref=asc_df_0765377063/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312060985096&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15582809728247648297&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023481&amp;hvtargid=pla-436205129938&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=fd291eb8801c3454ba521d208aecfa55&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwwYSwBhDcARIsAOyL0fhXFVjlsGDRZIUki5AtcJFtzJRfInFmvebKA5HUA6OZ-7F4yC6xUnAaAqxYEALw_wcB&quot;&gt;novels&lt;/a&gt;, which btw I have not read. This was emphatically not Game of Thrones, though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn't get much screentime in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing, they don't pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes, incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On the other hand it's like so much of today's TV, superheros, epic conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game&quot;&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/a&gt;. A space adventure and the supernatural. Net-net -- it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; worth it. A good distraction, I will probably watch Season 2.</description>

			<description>Never thought I'd be so glad to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xml-rpc site&lt;/a&gt; back up and running. I found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I'm not sure I would have noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of years ago.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I have not been able to reliably get to a bunch of my sites that use HTTP this morning. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://techfightclub.wordpress.com/feed/&quot;&gt;feeder.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, a site that I use to test feeds. Also &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible that something broke overnight in my server. Or Digital Ocean is having a problem? Doesn't seem like it's something Google is doing to punish me for using HTTP, though that is always the first thing that comes to mind. I tried moving the XML-RPC site to a different server, but the problem follows it. No changes have been made to the site in years. Not exactly what I had planned to be digging into on a nice (but cold) Sunday morning in the mountains. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;, if you have any insights. At least scripting.com is still working, but it's not served through my software or Digital Ocean.</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/22/031933.html&quot;&gt;other day&lt;/a&gt; I forgot to mention that style sheets might not be readable when you move from HTTP to HTTPS, leading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/24/httpsBreaksSitesThanksGoogle.png&quot;&gt;this striking breakage&lt;/a&gt; I saw when I first got to look at the site in its new location. And now thanks to Google and the EFF, I get to spend time debugging something that worked just fine in 1998 and every year since then. Should I send them the bill for my time? Fuckers.</description>

This blogroll is much like the one I had in the 00s, but it's in motion, and it's a source of news and ideas. It's also doing the thing that Twitter used to do, it lets me have a way to see what specific people are interested in. I expect more of that as new people get this kind of blogroll. Right now I'm pretty much the only one. The next step is getting the blogroll running in WordPress. And then getting it running on &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/&quot;&gt;Om's blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom have real experience with the art of blogrolling. From that, I expect to have a better idea of what the editorial UI should look like for people creating and managing these blogrolls. We'll iterate until it's pretty easy to set up and manage one. Also to be clear, I want it to run in other platforms, this is not exclusive to WordPress. It's just the place where the people are right now, the ones I really want to work with. But I wouldn't mind it running in &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; for example, if there are any writers there who find this compelling. That would require cooperation from the company though, their platform as far as I know, does not support other-party plugins.</description>

			<description>I saw someone get upset that ChatGPT can beat humans at debate, but we humans, esp here in the US for the last few decades, haven't been taking good care of ourselves intellectually. It would be one thing if we placed a high value on being informed and thoughtful, but we're going the other way. However, if we &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; aiming to be as smart and knowledgable as possible, we'd be losing to them anyway. The machines have infinitely expandable memory, and we don't and we lose stuff, and we hallucinate a lot more than they do. But why is it a problem if a machine does something better than we do, even something we (foolishly) think we're the best at. That's why we make machines. I have a great car, and live in a house that's heated in the winter and cooled in the summer. If I want to travel to the other side of the world, no problem. These are all things that machines do for me. One thing a machine might not be good at is inspiration. I asked ChatGPT to give me a good idea for something to write today. The idea it &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/194f509d-b494-4277-9cd4-5278e83f98ec&quot;&gt;came up with&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The Day the World Forgot How to Yawn.&quot; I rest my case.</description>

			<title>Broken images suck, Google</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://noimage.com/nosuchimage.png&quot; width=&quot;105&quot; height=&quot;105&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Something the HTTPS evangelists must not understand: there's substantial breakage when you convert an HTTP site to HTTPS. Every image in every page breaks. Broken images make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/22/statement.png&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, they're like broken windows, they say no one gives a F about this site. Well I care about the archive of scripting.com, I hope people understand that. I have been creating a record here since 1994. It'll be 30 years in October.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to blackmail me into breaking my archive, Google should be helping to preserve it. And not just mine, the entire early web. We poured our hearts and hopes into this, and massive amounts of time, without which Google would not exist.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know Google doesn't have a heart and it isn't a living thing, but it's bad PR to make that so freaking obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think that perhaps Google is already run by the machines. Maybe it was the first such company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To remind you of what Google's idea of the ancient web is, I put a broken image next to this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why we're lucky WordPress is here and other topics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this week reviewing the UI of Radio UserLand, released in 2002. It was both a feed reader and a writing tool.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and Facebook, and they said they weren't blogs, and presumably would start a new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. The new blogging platforms were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo&quot;&gt;silos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11 years to fully appreciate, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;give up&lt;/a&gt; on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did. There were some it couldn't cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of software on the desktop). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server&lt;/a&gt; idea realized. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So for example, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;, which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed. This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the file system. The product didn't live long enough to fulfill the potential of that feature. The idea was that you could use any editor you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;editor&lt;/a&gt; we supplied with Radio was one of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;, but I hoped that better editors would emerge. I wanted to make one myself, combining the outliner in Frontier with scripting, to drop posts into the folder structure that Radio expected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Radio's tiny little textbox circa 2002.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;. Dropbox was so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but they wouldn't go the final step, in creating a class of content that could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user didn't have enough control for it to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be revolutionary. How do I know? Because that's how computers worked before the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I'm going to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for it, at least to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully at some point I'll be able to turn that over to Automattic and have them run it, or if they don't want to, maybe someone else will. But it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation before the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technology does go backwards, a lot -- we lose valuable things without any thought, when we could keep them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, that's why it's good to keep some old people around, we might remember the things that were lost. I'm trying to make sure the really good ideas, the keepers, get another chance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/blogrollscreen.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Another random morning bit -- something subtle in the blogroll you might not have noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog posts typically have titles, social media posts do not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is opinionated about this -- it &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it's pretty simple. &lt;span&gt;If it doesn't have a title use the description&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way. What if motorcycles, cars, trucks and bikes couldn't all use the same roads? What kind of way would that be to run a civilization. Same thing with feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some don't. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn't show that difference that in the user interface. The users don't care and rightly so. It's confusing and takes their attention away from the writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress's RSS feeds. If I start a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for the post. That's the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title, which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs shouldn't change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don't know if they can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can't depend on the title being there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a &lt;i&gt;social web,&lt;/i&gt; and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a &lt;i&gt;social web,&lt;/i&gt; and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections." created="Thu, 21 Mar 2024 15:37:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/21/125505.html#a153700"/>

			<description>Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to Raptors. He wasn't the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them. He has a competitive grace you don't see very often. Quickley was one of those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team, he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side, if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks win they way they are winning now. That's what I want from developing software. I want to create a global team of truly independent developers, filling the void left by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation&quot;&gt;predation&lt;/a&gt; of the silos. There won't even be a business model for much of what we do, but there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We're going to play a game we started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can't produce end-user software much longer, but I don't want to leave until we have this thing rebooted.</description>

			<description>When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties, because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate. Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it's a good question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.</description>

			<description>Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features. Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112111808903353870&quot;&gt;On Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;: I've done this before, starting 25 years ago. Find some new connection I can make because someone was wise enough to add an RSS interface. I get to have an &lt;i&gt;aha!&lt;/i&gt; moment and a good laugh at how great this is and then write a freaking blog post about it, and people think man this web thing is pretty cool.</description>

I'd like to have a bit of JavaScript code ask to be notified when the user clicks on a link on my page that gets them a 404. I'd like a chance to do some looking around and seeing if I can find the thing they wanted. This comes up when you look at the archive of this blog for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/03.html&quot;&gt;March 1999&lt;/a&gt;. Back then my server was a Macintosh which had a case-insensitive operating system. A few years later I moved all the stuff to Amazon S3, much less hassle, and probably cheaper too. But over there the filesystem is case-sensitive. I must've been typing in URLs by hand and not caring about case, because why should I, my server didn't care. Except now it does care and when I click links to pages I know &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/03/18/everyonesEquallyNasty.html&quot;&gt;are there&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/03/everyonesEquallyNasty.html&quot;&gt;can't&lt;/a&gt; be found, I get depressed. I wanted to read the damn thing, that's why I clicked on it. Not to see some cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/thispageisnottherehahahah&quot;&gt;404 page&lt;/a&gt; (although it is pretty nice). Even better would be a way to tell Amazon to serve this bucket without regard to case.</description>

			<description>Saying the web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social&quot;&gt;misses&lt;/a&gt; Google Reader is like saying the United States misses President Trump. Why do I think that? Think of the mess Google left behind when they dumped the web. Putting all our cards in one basket in software is a very very very very bad idea. As everyone who misses The Orange Feed Reader is evidence of. It's like someone rips you off bad and all you can think about is how much you miss them. You, sir or madam, need to get your head examined.</description>

			<title>The big picture</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As I complete a big project I like to re-center, to remind myself what I'm working for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My goal is to create a &lt;i&gt;social web&lt;/i&gt; that includes blogs and twitter-like systems. To set a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;baseline&lt;/a&gt; where titles, simple styling, links, enclosures and the ability to edit are tools writers can use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Somehow twitter pushed writing into a tiny little box. If we work together we can dig ourselves out of this box. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
