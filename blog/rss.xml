He's a prototypical blogger, exactly the kind of person I hoped would &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/13/165056.html?title=sourcesGoDirectExplained&quot;&gt;create&lt;/a&gt; their own media having profound positive impact on people's lives. People like me. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/&quot;&gt;500 Songs&lt;/a&gt; podcast, which I've written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+500+songs&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt;, focuses on a song in every episode and tells you how the pieces came together to create it. When a new episode comes out I greedily savor it, like a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bagel&quot;&gt;bagel&lt;/a&gt; from Zabar's or a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino#Filmography&quot;&gt;Tarantino&lt;/a&gt; movie. Two recent episodes, one about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-165-dark-star-by-the-grateful-dead/&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead&lt;/a&gt; and the other about &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-171-hey-jude-by-the-beatles/&quot;&gt;Hey Jude&lt;/a&gt;, changed my views of each of the groups, in the first case confirming an intuition, and in the other showing me how naive my idea of how a song comes together. I am envious of how the musicians work together, it may be a cuthroat industry, but it seems incredibly collaborative compared to how tech works, where we all pretty much ignore each other. Hickey isn't just a podcaster, he's also a blogger, and he does it in an unusual place, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. He has things to say and that's of course what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB's&lt;/a&gt; are all about. You may not care for their opinions, but you will know what they are. Anyway, if you like the Beatles, I highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-171-hey-jude-by-the-beatles/&quot;&gt;latest episode&lt;/a&gt;, and if you like popular music, &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/feed/podcast/&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2F500songs.com%2Ffeed%2Fpodcast%2F&quot;&gt;500 Songs&lt;/a&gt;. And if you know of any podcasts like this, please let me know. I always want to add to my podcast reading list.</description>

It was not a fantastic year, work-wise. I spent almost all my time working away from my interests. First project was completely replacing the identity system in the two apps I'm maintaining -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, and letting the others end. No one ever says thanks for this kind of work, but it's as basic as converting a house from oil heat to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump&quot;&gt;heat pump&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the ducts still work, but things break in hard to find ways. I also converted FeedLand from a simple app that runs on a virtual server, to a scalable and durable app (we hope) that runs in a big cloud. This part was good, but again the work is far from where my expertise and interests lie. So at the beginning of a new year, I'm going to remind myself that I'm too old and not paid well enough (I'm not paid at all, heh) to do another year of this kind of work. I should be making writing and reading tools work better on the web. That's my mission. If it isn't related to that, please understand when I don't give it a high priority. Just one person here. Surprisingly resilient, but also quite tired.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I wonder if dying is like waking from from a dream, hopefully with friends and loved ones waiting for you, like going to a diner after seeing a movie together and you all talk about how you liked it, and if you want to see it again.</description>

			<description>When I say &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;applying the philosophy of podcasting to text&quot; -- what I mean in practical terms is that my flow of ideas is available &quot;where ever you get your text.&quot; Choice in subscribing has to be that fluid, commonsense, and choice is something people feel entitled to, as they do with podcasts. I've been told people would never understand the philosophy of podcasting, but they do, they understand they're entitled to choice in how to listen and thus producers are free to choose where to publish. Somehow text, which is so much easier to transmit than audio, is far less flexible. That's a mistake I want to undo, but I can't do it alone. I need to work with other people who have writing and reading tools, and people who have something to say and want all the features of writing to be at their disposal, and for it to be easy, inexpensive but not free of charge, and not owned by the titans of tech. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7dBMYUyRAQ&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind. &quot;You can get it if you really want.&quot;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I wrote that &lt;i&gt;working together&lt;/i&gt; is the challenge for open tech developers. If you're waiting for a big company to work with you, and we all are, the answer is you'll probably wait a long time, and you probably won't get there. It's not impossible, but it is improbable. So while you're waiting, why not work with a peer on solving a problem you both have in somewhat different ways, but make what you do compatible. That's what working together is about. It's not just that the people did it, but you created something that lives on that works together. There's even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH3ruuml-R4&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; that goes with this. &quot;If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with.&quot;</description>

			<description>The new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; has been running for a couple of days, and seems to be working well. But I'm not sure everyone is seeing the new version.

			<description>I'm going to write rebuttals to important Wikipedia pages that get the story wrong. In the past this was pointless, because search engines ranked them so high, but now I find that ChatGPT figures out the real story somehow, almost always, even if Wikipedia is wildly wrong. I figure our blogging helps.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's new.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you click on a tab, we change the URL in the address bar to point to the tab, the same way we do on the Scripting News home page. If you bookmark that link, you'll go to that tab.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click the white-on-orange XML icon to get an OPML subscription list for the feeds with the category of the current selected tab. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The four buttons below each item now work. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It should work reasonably well on phones and tablets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's served with HTTPS because in upcoming versions you'll be able to log in. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that's about it, in terms of visible features. Behind the scenes there's a new tab manager. I figured since all my apps use tabs these days, I should make the investment of having a single tab manager that has all the bells and whistles, invoked by setting an option.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The customary &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/27/newsScripting.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/285&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for any questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Very often when I got to the store and plugged the machine in, it would start right up. That became a superstition, if your computer won't launch take it for a ride in the car. Anyway, this morning, in 2023, my web app, the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; that I'm working on was in a state that was really depressing. I was working on making it mobile-friendly and nothing I did would make the timeline fit into the alotted space. I was at my wits end, thinking maybe I'd have to revert my changes and try another approach. So I went out for a walk, it's a nice day, kind of warm, and the air is clear, no rain, and there are even some trees in bloom which is weird considering that it's &lt;i&gt;the day after Christmas&lt;/i&gt; for crying out loud. But it was a good thing to do, when I got back I had a plan for how to go forward. My brain was now clear. I got myself a nice bowl of fruit salad and a glass of water, and sat down and rolled up my sleeves, and I bet by now dear reader you've figured out the punchline. It worked. I did nothing. Every bit showed up in the right place, more or less (modulo some tweaking). Back with Apple II in the 80s it wasn't really magic. The chips weren't soldered into the motherboard on the machine, and they would get pretty hot, and when you'd turn the computer off and on, it would go hot and cold, which meant the pins on the chips would expand and contract and in doing so, over months, one could unseat. A trip in the car might just jog it back into its socket. The same way, forty years later, if you get up from the computer and go for a walk, when you come back, cached requests have now aged-out and the files that weren't getting refreshed are now up to date, and it turns out I wasn't crazy or incompetent, and it probably wasn't some kind of act of god, it's just the internet being the internet.</description>

			<description>This period is often a time of innovation in the world of blogs, podcasting and feeds. For me this year, I'm using the time to do more work on CSS and basic user interface stuff for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and for news products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, which has been surprisingly popular. The new stuff will start showing up first in that site, pretty soon. The goal is to build on its popularity, to bootstrap a new platform.</description>

			<description>I also want to write a bit more about RSS support in Bluesky, what it means, and ideas for next steps. BTW, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/25/emailToJayAtBluesky.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the email I sent to Jay Graber, the CEO of Bluesky, on Dec 12, asking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; support, which was released publicly ten days later on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/22.html&quot;&gt;Dec 22&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I made a change to how images are served from this blog, to see if the images are still blocked by GMail. Previously we redirected to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/santa.png&quot;&gt;S3 file&lt;/a&gt;, so we could use HTTPS and but not have to have the bits flow through one of my Digital Ocean servers, which after this change, they now do. For most of you this will be blah blah whatever blah blah zzzz, but some people may find it interesting.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;We can now subscribe to Bluesky feeds in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/23/subscribeScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Subscribe sub-menu&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;i&gt;To one feed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Enter the URL of a Bluesky profile page. For example, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/neilhimself.neilgaiman.com&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to Neil Gaiman's profile. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When this feature came out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/22.html#a193746&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it didn't work with FeedLand because we were looking for full URLs pointing to a feed in their feed discovery link and they provided a relative URL.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fix was in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;feedHunter package&lt;/a&gt;, it now looks for relative URLs and makes them full before trying to find the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I understand why they used a relative URL, they're getting ready to federate and it's probably simpler for them to just specify a relative URL.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I think this is going to be a problem -- in the world of feeds, software usually expects full URLs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is what a Bluesky feed &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Fdid%3Aplc%3Apn5qdowybxjewkcq6zzenvtq%2Frss&quot;&gt;looks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/23/blueskyfeedinfeedlandscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; in FeedLand on Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Here's why. He took an &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/&quot;&gt;oath&lt;/a&gt; to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He did the opposite, he attacked the Constitution. So how can we ask him to take the same oath again, the one that he violated the last time he took it. The Constitution is very wise, it's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou&quot;&gt;Maya Angelou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371&quot;&gt;taught&lt;/a&gt; -- when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. That's why he can't be president again. He can't be believed when he takes the oath, and if he can't take the oath he can't be President.</description>

I'm much better at it this go-around than the last time. Generally I can get it done in three or four moves. If it takes five it's because I made a mistake or took a gamble on the second move that didn't work out. These days I don't even try for the second move, but this morning, on the first move I got four out of the five letters, and got the correct position of two of the four. It took a couple of seconds to see that there was really only one answer, so I decided to risk it, and there was this moment we yearn for when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg&quot;&gt;letters reveal&lt;/a&gt; one at a time, all green, a final correct move, in two. First time I've ever gotten that result. I wasn't even sure it was possible. Well there it is. Almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/22/9999.png&quot;&gt;perfect&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing more to say than Yay Me! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Conversation vs publishing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Conversation has a place, but I think we've explored that pretty well, and now I want to create better publishing and reading systems, that are as fast as social web systems, but place less emphasis on replies that can be seen by everyone, because that often is not really conversation, it's spam. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think ultimately we'll be disappointed with federation for all the reasons we're frustrated with earlier social web systems. People trying to get attention for their ideas, which often are spam or trolling. I also think this means RSS will be more valuable going forward because it's great at publishing, checking all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to build with and around WordPress. I think of WordPress as a basic platform the way I saw Twitter between 2006 and 2022. Now the question is what are the steps to use WordPress as the back-end of a social communication system. Behind the scenes, its database has all the capabilities we need to provide the tools writers need. And it has excellent RSS support. It all runs at scale and has a mature yet simple API.  That is all we need to form a hub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ChatGPT is my CSS advisor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who don't program must not have any idea how much of a boon ChatGPT is to us programmers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; coding far in advance of my previous capability. When I know something is possible, but I haven't the slightest idea how to specify it, I just ask, in my own words. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, a very common thing to want to do is to put a : after the text in the first column every row of a table. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/b19c1c8d-3e19-4039-86aa-803eb7cf46d6&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; how to do it, in English, as I did above. This is what it came up with:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr td:first-child::after {content: &quot;:&quot;;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you see it like that you can almost figure out what's going on if you squint and close one eye. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And it works. I literally shrieked when it did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I am the boss of CSS.. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I'd like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There's nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we're on leads, and don't give people a reason to hope that it's not as serious as it is.</description>

			<title>They're letting us have RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Assume that FB doesn't really want to interop, so that's why there's a year timeline on developing AP functionality. No rush. Let's keep growing and later on we can have an app store that only lets certain sites into our world, subject to our turning them off at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assuming this is true, RSS is their worst nightmare. It's implemented in a week, if you're really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vociferous&quot;&gt;vociferous&lt;/a&gt; users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they're pissing in the wind. I am doing CSS coding far in advance of my previous capability, when I know something is possible, but I haven't the slightest idea how to specify it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember they said RSS is Dead. I always felt that was aimed at me, but it was aimed at them too, even more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing to do, build -- intelligently, slowly, showing interop at every step. Watch out for people who take stuff out with out putting back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>There's actual news tonight</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/231219/p55#a231219p55&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; tonight, when there's some &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/19/us/trump-colorado-ballot-news#trump-colorado-ballot-14th-amendment&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, and it's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;What they're not saying is that the US has the tools to defend itself from enemies like Trump, and finally we're starting to use them. Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html&quot;&gt;last resort&lt;/a&gt; to keep a nightmare out of the government.  An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters. But -- better late than never. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if they want to have a civil war, okay -- better to do it when the military is under constitutional control, at least theoretically. Tell the Republicans to try again, now before any primary votes have been cast. This candidate is prohibited from being president, as if he were born outside the United States. Not qualified. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Music at The Colony</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;The Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. It's small venue that &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/&quot;&gt;goes way back&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/19/levinBrothers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Levin Brothers band at The Colony, Sunday night. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt;, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin&quot;&gt;Pete Levin&lt;/a&gt; on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22.

The Beatles were the music my generation grew up with, but I never really even understood that there was a difference between a John song and a Paul song. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second great influence has been Andrew Hickey's &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;500 songs&lt;/a&gt; podcast. Now I have so many more stories to go with the music that my life was formed by. And I have a feeling that attending this event on Sunday will turn out to be a similar influence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, what music should I go see next? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The concert was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nippertown.com/2023/12/18/concert-review-the-levin-brothers-the-linda-12-16-2023/&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;The Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. It's small venue that &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/&quot;&gt;goes way back&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back." created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:05:07 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a130507"/>

				<source:outline text="I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt;, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform." created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:29:05 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a132905"/>
				<source:outline text="The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin&quot;&gt;Pete Levin&lt;/a&gt; on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years?" created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:09:36 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a130936"/>
				<source:outline text="The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking." created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:21:14 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a132114"/>

That's how we're doing it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for Brent's account on Bluesky, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It's too good an opportunity to pass up.</description>

			<description>One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account to feed we do with sites that support &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html&quot;&gt;feed discovery&lt;/a&gt;. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for Bluesky. I expect we'll do that for FeedLand via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;FeedHunter package&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>The last episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png&quot;&gt;Oh The Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Just let me know what Metacritic says, and make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I want more info. Don't make me look it up. People joke about how we spend our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it's true, I do it. Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online. How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of the links generated by their CMS are broken.)</description>
