			<description>The Repubs and some Dems think they can make Covid go away by legislating it out of existence. Oh they are so stupid, and we're about to pay the price, again, for their stupidity.</description>

			<description>Twitter is still the easiest blogging platform out there. Just add titles, styling and links, and get rid of the character limit and Twitter will own the world. Hopefully with the new management they will do this. Why is it OK with me? They have a fine API. I've got good &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=twitter.addGroupToList&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for it in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting environment&lt;/a&gt;. They run the servers, that's OK with me.</description>

			<description>I had to do some driving today, I love driving the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tesla&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to say that. I hope people who get other electric cars have a similar experience. It's just such a smooth ride, and so much power. I have also mostly got the getting in and out part down, just the right way to twist my body, thanks to advice from my friend Chuck Shotton who is a longtime Tesla owner.</description>

			<description>At one point in the ride I was shuffling podcasts and thinking this is too dangerous and then I remembered I'm driving a car that theoretically can drive itself. So I clicked the right stick down twice to activate the driving functionality and took my hands off the steering wheel. I talked to the car as if it were a 17-year-old learning to drive, giving it encouragement and preparing to take over when it started to drive off the road. Something weird happened, it started flashing red, and then really started flashing red, which I interpreted as &quot;I can't handle this, you take over, Mr Human.&quot; Which I did. But I was driving on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_209&quot;&gt;US 209&lt;/a&gt;, basically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9641439,-74.0222502,3a,75y,200.84h,80.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D284.48877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;, two lanes in each direction, divided, lots of room everywhere, good weather, well marked lanes. If it couldn't handle this, what could it handle? This was the first time I tried letting it drive itself. Not sure what went wrong.</description>

			<description>I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/a-new-nuclear-age/&quot;&gt;latest Open Source podcast&lt;/a&gt;. You must listen to this one. It's about the new reality of nuclear war. Chris Lydon talks to all the most interesting academics, and it's clear they really like and respect him. If you watch MSNBC, skip Rachel Maddow one night every week and listen to Chris and his guests. I think they should put him on TV with exactly the same guests as he has now, and let him cover exactly what he covers. It's much higher quality than anything you get from any other source. Swear to god. It's for adults, smart ones. It's not a bedtime story (and that's a good thing).</description>

			<description>So I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how I have really good friends for a long time who have never used an outliner, and somehow must think they understand me at some level, when they just can't. Imagine for example you had a friend who was a guitar player. Not the most famous or best ever, but still someone who had devoted their life to creating music with guitars. And then imagine not only had you not listened to your friend playing the guitar, but you hadn't listened to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; play a guitar. You didn't know what a guitar was. You sent them a link to a story about someone humming while driving and asked if it was like that. That's been my experience. I live with it. But I've never liked it. My software actually isn't hard to learn, at least not compared to other software like Twitter, Facebook, a word processor, an ATM. It's a low-grade source of frustration. Most days I write stuff on this blog and hear back nothing. But it seems some people read it. I just write for myself. I think I'm going to go back to doing that with software too. 2021 was an exceptional year, I decided to devote the whole year to creating a real end-user piece of softwaare -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I never hear anything nice about it. Mostly from people who refuse to read the docs complaining that they don't know how to do something that's covered in the docs. This isn't what I had in mind when I spent all of last year building the product and writing excellent docs.</description>

			<description>Another example. I probably spent in total a whole month doing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2022/01/23/153755.html?title=howToUseTreechartFromDrummer&quot;&gt;Tree Chart&lt;/a&gt; app. Two comments. One saying they wanted more features, and another from a semi-famous person who said he missed MORE, so I pointed him to Drummer. He complained that the tree chart part of Drummer wasn't as good as MORE's and that's it. Nothing beyond that. I wonder if people know how much effort it takes to create something like this (obviously they don't) or are willing to invest anything at all in helping? Obviously not that either. So I think the only way to go is to create software for a market of one -- me -- and leave it at that. Maybe I'll share some of it, maybe I won't. It's a lot of extra work to share it, and from my point of view, the work is an utter waste of time. Basically most people are selfish assholes. I think the Beatles felt this way about their fans too. I've been learning so much about them this year. But at least we all listened to their music, even if we had no idea who they were, and how they created the music.</description>

			<description>A few months ago I read a comment on Twitter, not directed to me but with my name tagged, that said that RSS will be able to move again once Dave Winer is dead. Isn't that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwoUKhZQbg&quot;&gt;special&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure that's not true btw, but to be thought of as only contributing obstruction. I think it's like that in a lot of things I've worked on. People have tried to buy my products away from me, not realizing I still owned them. That was comedy. Other people, supposed friends, told me they were taking over, I should get out of their way or I'd get hurt. The first couple of times that happened, from someone who was very rich, I fell for it. It wasn't true. His products were flops because he had no idea what people valued in the products. I did because I had connections with the users and I listened, systematically. At LVT we got very good at listening, we knew in advance that new releases would be loved because were simply giving the users what they wanted. Once another rich guy offered me $1 million for my company or he was going to blow me out of the water (his words). Yeah I said, i've heard that before. Go right ahead. He never shipped anything even remotely competitive. BTW, our product was making more than $1 million &lt;i&gt;a month&lt;/i&gt; at the time. He didn't even bother to get the numbers. All this says to me is that &lt;i&gt;we should fucking work together dammit. &lt;/i&gt;Look at the Beatles and how individually they reached out to other musicians and recorded with them. Why don't we do that in software. If there's going to be more RSS, why shouldn't it benefit from what I've learned? You might be surprised to find that a new RSS can't happen &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; I am involved, Mr Waiting For Me To Die. Why take the chance? I didn't save the tweet because I didn't want to ever close that loop. Imagine how that felt. The world is full of self-important assholes, and we've given every one of them tools to express their assholyness. You can quote me on that.</description>

			<description>Putin was probably inspired by Dubya and his shock and awe, but too bad for Putin he didn’t have America’s arms industry and wealth.

			<description>The problem with Putin and any “great” person is that as their fame grows they remain a normal-size human. Eventually they revert to normal size in perception too. There are no exceptions.</description>

Take an idea that was developed on the open internet, without lock-in, then fund a startup to do the same thing, with lock-in and don't change the name. In other words take something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/21/124205.html&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, which thrives because users and publishers have choice and there are no gatekeepers, and lock it up and still call it podcasting.</description>

			<description>This subject comes up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/&quot;&gt;Ben Thompson's latest newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, which he has kindly given me a free subscription to. He discusses &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack's&lt;/a&gt; business model. The occasion is their releasing an iOS version of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; reader. Since Substack is VC-funded, I am suspicious of their support for RSS. I expect there's lock-in in there. But I don't have the time or actual interest to dig in and find out what they did. I know they require you to use their editor to publish through their channel. When they came out I was looking for a way to distribute this blog via email, so I asked if they supported inbound RSS. No. You have to use their editor. Well I had been through that with Facebook and Medium and was fed up with software turning me into a typist. As with most writers, I have a writing setup that I'm happy with, and I'm not going to change all that just to get an email delivery system. I wrote my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;emailer&lt;/a&gt;. I wish we had a good way to offer that to everyone, but that takes time that I don't have. And frankly some users aren't adult enough to deal well with gifts. So writers who want to distribute via email are getting locked in. So it goes.</description>

			<title>He must have his cheeseburger</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KevinRothrock/status/1503039647739428864&quot;&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt; says so much to me. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/14/fatRussianMcDonaldsFan.png&quot;&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt; Russian man named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikas_Safronov&quot;&gt;Nikas Safronov&lt;/a&gt; chains himself to a closed Moscow McDonald's, fighting for his right to a cheeseburger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have the right to close down!” he protests.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Wikipedia he &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/14/safronov.png&quot;&gt;looks&lt;/a&gt; like a rock star. Seriously. If this is what we did to Russia, well I understand now what we're looking at. That could be Lincoln, Nebraska -- if they lost their Wendy's or Boston if they cut off the internet. We need to turn our attention to the people of Ukraine, and observe the difference. The future demands our determination. We are failing the test. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin, Trump, Boris Johnson, they're all the same disease. To break free and get our species on track, we need to face ourselves. So much of what I hear as criticism of Russia applies equally to the US.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russian cheeseburger man.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's even more clear that the Beatles didn't &quot;break up&quot; as much as they stayed together for a long time. You get the sense of how exhausted they must've been of being a Beatle. This goes back to something I've learned myself in a career that included more than the normal amount of public presence. We all are just individual people, no matter how big the rep. It doesn't get much bigger than being a Beatle. But it doesn't really have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; to be a Beatle, because a human can't be that big.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=get%20back&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; recording session comes off as a catastrophe in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/13.html#a203829&quot;&gt;Beatles Anthology&lt;/a&gt;. Harrison tells a great story of how it compared to a session he had just come back from with Bob Dylan and the Band in Woodstock. I think the Beatles got lost trying to do more than what they were best at -- which is hanging out in a studio for a couple of months and turning the music world upside down in a great way. McCartney at one point says we're just a small band, we do rock and roll and the blues. So why were they doing movies and having boutiques and planning big concerts where the fans were kept far away. I wish, as a fan, they had found a way to continue doing what they did so well, and branch out and do all the other stuff they wanted to do as individuals. If they had had a good manager, someone who loved them and who could manage an organization and keep it out of their way, the Beatles might have been able to do more. But I'm still satisfied that the amazing thing was that they lasted as long as they did.</description>

			<description>Think about it, how is Ukraine doing such a great job of making sure they aren't forgotten. Their president is a comedian. It would be great if Biden had comedian friends. Let them explain what's going on. Let Biden do the behind the scenes stuff, he's doing that well.</description>

			<title>Google Reader, nine years later</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/15/wickedWitch.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, after Google Reader had its plug pulled. I'm guessing most people who read that piece have no idea what I'm talking about, because most don't think about online systems as defining a base of content they can move around. Think of it this way. Imagine if you couldn't fly into one city, you had to take a train, but to another city you had to fly, there was no train. The obvious thing would be to build a train route to the city without one, and do the same for air. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simply: Twitter says posts have no titles and Google said posts must have titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the online world has been so dysfunctional that here we are nine years later, and RSS readers still can't deal with Twitter style content. I see Twitter is advertising that they're going to open up. Then this is going to be a problem they have to deal with too. I also believe it can be solved. I've been using a reader that handles both kinds of posts since the advent of RSS, there to be copied by anyone who dared to look. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway... Maybe we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Let's have an election about what it's really about for a change.

I think a very compelling campaign could be had. And if, in the end, the people want to be ruled by an autocrat, then that's where we're going next. I don't think it'll last very long, when Americans find out what it really means. There's a good chance it all falls apart when the Supreme Court overturns Roe.</description>

			<title>Worldle and Wordle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I play both these games it seems every day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt; is the less famous of the two. It displays a map of a country at the top of the screen. As with Wordle you guess what the country is in a stack of six boxes. It tells you how close you are for each guess, what direction the correct country is in and a percentage representing how close you got, 100 percent is perfect, the furthest you can be is 50 (I assume). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is 5398km from Bermuda, due east.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/todaysCountry.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;There's a lot of info you don't get, most important is the scale of the map. It could be 1000 miles or 3 miles wide. There are a lot of countries that are islands in the Pacific, Carribbean or Indian oceans. They have unique shapes just like the bigger countries. Although I think I have a good grasp of geography from having loved maps as a kid, there a lot more countries than I ever realized. For example, get out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://geology.com/world/cia-africa-map.shtml&quot;&gt;map of Africa&lt;/a&gt; sometime and ponder. The names may be familiar, but I had little sense of relative position or the shape of most of them. It's also fun to try to figure out where the ocean is based on the shape of the borders. There are no straight edge shorelines as far as I know. Some of the puzzles are easy, like Indonesia or Poland, and some are surprisingly difficult, like Greece. Did you know there's an island country in the English Channel? I didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler! Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/worldlerSolution.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of today's puzzle, I just guessed wildly in the last slot, knowing Spain was wrong. I basically gave up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/wordleSolution.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; puzzle really screwed with a lot of people's heads, mine too. I was lucky, my strategy made it possible to solve this puzzle, though in general I get lower scores overall because of the way I do it. For the first two or three guesses, I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just trying to find out which vowels are in the answer, and to eliminate most of the popular consonants. So in today's puzzle when I had two slots left, I had the last four letters right (as did most people) but unlike the others, I only had two possible choices left for the first letter. I guessed incorrectly first, and then got the correct answer in the sixth slot. Wordle's comment was &lt;i&gt;whew.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, my standard first word these days is &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.8em&quot;&gt;PENIS&lt;/span&gt;. I like it because it's got two vowels and three popular consonants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="There's a lot of info you don't get, most important is the scale of the map. It could be 1000 miles or 3 miles wide. There are a lot of countries that are islands in the Pacific, Carribbean or Indian oceans. They have unique shapes just like the bigger countries. Although I think I have a good grasp of geography from having loved maps as a kid, there a lot more countries than I ever realized. For example, get out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://geology.com/world/cia-africa-map.shtml&quot;&gt;map of Africa&lt;/a&gt; sometime and ponder. The names may be familiar, but I had little sense of relative position or the shape of most of them. It's also fun to try to figure out where the ocean is based on the shape of the borders. There are no straight edge shorelines as far as I know. Some of the puzzles are easy, like Indonesia or Poland, and some are surprisingly difficult, like Greece. Did you know there's an island country in the English Channel? I didn't." created="Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:32:50 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/todaysCountry.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a163250"/>

				<source:outline text="Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; puzzle really screwed with a lot of people's heads, mine too. I was lucky, my strategy made it possible to solve this puzzle, though in general I get lower scores overall because of the way I do it. For the first two or three guesses, I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just trying to find out which vowels are in the answer, and to eliminate most of the popular consonants. So in today's puzzle when I had two slots left, I had the last four letters right (as did most people) but unlike the others, I only had two possible choices left for the first letter. I guessed incorrectly first, and then got the correct answer in the sixth slot.

That made a mess of things. &lt;i&gt;Now it's almost 20 years later,&lt;/i&gt; and it should be obvious that hurrying up isn't the answer. We can create another mess, or we can slowly rebuild and create a strong, well-understood standard, and forget about world domination, let's just make a nice reading and writing environment. Software is an art, not just a way to get rich. That would be what I would focus on. I have a motto &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; Think about the 15 wasted years in RSS-land, and you'll see what I mean.

I think there's a chance we'll see a return to the more thoughtful blogosphere of the late 90s and early 00s, and I think Substack is part of it. I also would love to know, without having to dig through the app, if they've extended RSS, added a new namespace with Substack-specific data, or if it's straight RSS with common namespace extensions. Also it looks like their reader requires items to have titles. Is that so? I've been playing around with some new reader ideas, no claim that anything will ship, but one thing we have to accommodate is title-less posts, otherwise we're going to end up right back where we are now with a division -- the quick stuff on Twitter, and only long stuff in RSS. That was a divide forced on us by the now long-defunct Google Reader. Also factor in the idea that Twitter might be about to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/21/224554.html?title=twitterArticles&quot;&gt;longer titled posts&lt;/a&gt; to their ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: This is how Substack's reader deals with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/10/substackTitlelessPosts.png&quot;&gt;title-less posts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They generate a title from the permalink of the post. I don't think this is necessary, I think designers of readers have to pick a different starting point if they want to work with the way writing in the web works today. I know they don't pay any attention to me, which is really weird, because I do know a thing or two about this. But it is a fact, a lot of posts don't have titles. If your reader can't accommodate them, you have a problem, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Writing, reading and projection</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you read something, you're not in touch with the author's emotions, not when they wrote it, and esp not now, long after they wrote it. Emotions are fluid things, and unless you're very careful, it's unlikely that the emotions you are feeling, as you read the piece, are the author's. It would be a remarkable coincidence if they were. They're your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It just happened to me on Twitter, someone thought a tweet of mine was rage. I never feel that when I'm writing. Because writing is different, transcribing thoughts and feelings I had long ago. Writing feels very different. Usually I'm laughing out loud if I'm writing something that I really like. Writing is like riding a roller coaster. Often it's an exercise in frustration, but when you get it right, it's a wonderful feeling, it's a joyful act, paradoxically, even when you're writing about something that is far from joyful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case, I was writing an idea I had in the early 90s, and first wrote about in the mid-90s, at much greater length than in the tweet. In all that time, I've continued to hold the belief that we create each other, that we're a single species, not two. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, projection isn't fun, on the receiving end. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
