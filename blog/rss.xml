I was interviewed by the very capable Nathan Wrigley of WP Tavern. I thought it was a great conversation, we talked about the remarkable position WordPress is in to serve as the OS for a rebooted web. I love the introduction they wrote, I also figured out how to make content management work in the browser, which was the foundation for blogging and eventually WordPress, though it seems that legacy is a bit lost in all the other stuff I've had my fingers in over the years. I hope you listen to this podcast, and if you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/podcast/186-dave-winer-on-decentralisation-wordpress-and-open-publishing&quot;&gt;questions or comments&lt;/a&gt;, here's a good place to post them.</description>

			<description>This came up in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@darius@friend.camp/115266052576766302&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon about &quot;social network&quot; vs &quot;social media.&quot; I also think &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; should be used sparingly.  Because imho there is such a thing as the social web but we haven't developed very much of it, i think because we were intimidated by the silos. I'm not intimidated any more, I'm fed up and going ahead without them.</description>

It has a REST api that you can build on. Everything WordPress does. It's the API the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.wordpress.com/wp-admin/index.php?page=my-blogs&quot;&gt;browser client&lt;/a&gt; is built on. I didn't know it was there until I added WordPress login to FeedLand a couple of years ago. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. What can I do with it? It snuck up on me that it's an API for the web, and it's also the easiest API for ActivityPub. The programming model for the fediverse might be a lot simpler than you think. WordLand is as exciting as any web product I did before, because now, after being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle&quot;&gt;asleep&lt;/a&gt; for 19 years, the web can now wake up. It really feels that way.</description>

			<description>Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://openchannels.fm/exploring-wordpress-textcasting-and-open-web-standards/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; was with Matthias Pfefferle, who is developing Automattic's ActivityPub functionality. I talk about the totality of the app I'm building and the role WordPress and RSS play in the network. It's an all-web approach to social media. Another big podcast came out today, this one for the WordPress community. I'll write it up tomorrow. I'm on a press tour folks and having a great time. I think I finally found my tribe? And if you're in Canada, come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp in Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, October 15-17. I haven't given a public in person talk since April 2019. I'm realllly looking forward to this.</description>

I wanted to introduce my ideas to the Fediverse world. I haven't listened to it yet, but I remember it being a good discussion on basically all the things I am working on and with these days. It's all a continuation of what we were doing when we were so rudely interrupted by the silos, Twitter, Facebook, Bluesky and to a lesser extent Mastodon. I want to reform social media, go back to the beginning and let's ask the question -- what kind of social media does the web want? Start with the basics, and build a stack that performs like Twitter or Bluesky, but never veer from the standards of the web. Every component must be replaceable. Writers must have all the writing power of the web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Prodromou&quot;&gt;Evan Prodromou&lt;/a&gt; will be glad to hear that I am a huge fan of the role &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; is playing in bringing the power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; to Mastodon. Matthias, my partner in this podcast episode has been working on this since 2008, and now we are reaping the benefit all the way up the stack in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. See, that's what the web is about. Building and including. Without walls that keep competitors out and keep users in.</description>

			<description>Why &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;? When Twitter came out in 2006 they left out most of the writing features of the web. Their competitors copied the limits. Textcasting says writers don't want the limits. Add &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;these features&lt;/a&gt; to your twitter-like social network and we are happy and will sing your praise. That's it. It's no more complicated than that. People ask questions about what it means. This is what it means.</description>

			<description>It happened so slowly that we didn't notice but Twitter wiped out the idea of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22web%20developer%22&quot;&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt;. The platforms we were trying to make work together were programmed so they &lt;i&gt;couldn't&lt;/i&gt; work together. As well-intentioned we may have been, it wasn't the web we were developing for. I know the term web developer has come to mean more than it means to me. But it's like saying someone is a Mac developer. A web developer creates apps for the web. Not for a specific service. For any service that supports the open formats that everyone else uses.</description>

			<title>My new blog home page?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a plan for how to bootstrap WordLand 0.8.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First I will introduce you to a new way to read my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It will be a timeline of items posted to many of my feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;daveverse -- lives on WordPress and Mastodon.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Great art on Bluesky -- daily version.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;links.daveverse.org -- my linkblog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Scripting News -- my main blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Scripting News podcast -- a new podcast stream. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;WordCamp Canada 2025 -- I'm keynoting in October.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What each of these have in common is that each has an RSS feed that supports rssCloud. So updates flow instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway... so instead of going to scripting.com, you'll go to this other place, on an experimental basis. It's got color and nice icons, and looks a bit like a timeline in twitter-like systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now here's the fun part. You may read something that you want to comment on. Or quote what I've said. The kinds of things you do on twitter-like systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You will be able to do that. The editor is right there. One click away while you're reading. I didn't invent this flow, Twitter did, it's comfortable, we understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The difference is here you edit in your space and pass around links via &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will see what you wrote, but it's up to me if it is attached to my posts. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/09/10/aNewModelForBlogDiscourse.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about this earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This, imho, is the social network the web always wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My timeline as a FeedLand-compatible &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=daveverse&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It got me going on various explorations. Wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/09/21/dave-learns-of-headless-wordpress/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on my WP site. It's actually easier for me to write posts on that site when all I have is my iPad. I do all my writing on Scripting News in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a desktop-only app. I'm going to start engaging in discussions about WordPress where the people are. Also starting to think about my keynote in Ottawa in October which is now less than a month away. A note to the people running the show, I would be open to having it be an interview instead of a speech. I have trouble staying anchored to the audience with slides, I don't really like that way of communicating. I prefer interview style, with an interviewer who is interested in the subject matter. I want to do at least a bit of a demo, talk about how we got here, the early blogosphere, all the things that led to WordPress, and the connection WordPress has now to social media systems like Mastodon. We must focus on that connection because so much has been accomplished there in the last year, and it hasn't imho gotten enough attention. I want to talk more about the big picture, how WordPress has a role to play that goes beyond serving ecommerce sites, which is, I understand where the money is. Money is good but right now imho our world wide public communication system desperately needs an upgrade. It's been crippled by decisions made by Twitter almost 20 years ago. I want to turn that around, put back &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;the features they took out&lt;/a&gt;, and to do that I need to start a network that's built on the web, not in silos that can't connect to each other. That is not the web I know, where everything can connect to anything. I don't think at this time any of the social media apps should be considered part of the web. I remember the magic of the web, we built the blogosphere around the web, and thus WordPress is also built around the web. For more perspective, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in August about thinking differently about WordPress. That's what I am the evangelist for, thinking about WordPress in a different, wider role, bringing the web to the people in a very usable way.</description>

			<description>Here's a thought for WordPress users and developers. WordPress is huge, but it's just part of the web. That's what it means to be on the web, my friends. Everything connects to anything on the web. Once we build out a social network from WordPress, all the other systems will have no choice but to hook up too. All this talk of AT Proto and ActivityPub being the connecting glue is nonsense. &lt;i&gt;The web is the connecting glue. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>In ways older people handle change better than younger ones, because we know change is here, every freaking day, and we know in a few years, at most, really big change is coming. So the attitude of the older person is often what the fuck, let's go. I'm not kidding. Maybe later in life I will get more conservative, it could happen.</description>

			<description>There should be a ChatGPT &quot;personality&quot; for the chatbot. I'd like to start with a black lab. When I say &quot;good work&quot; that reinforces that what it did should be a priority. If I say that and give it a treat (by typing &quot;treat&quot;) that should get double emphasis. I might like it better if I could train it. I don't mind a little enthusiasm, but I want it to respond to me with respect.</description>

			<title>Can we finally put the past behind us?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cross-posted from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/09/16/can-we-finally-put-the-past-behind-us/&quot;&gt;daveverse site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t considered the point of view of people who worked at Netscape when it disappeared just as RSS 0.9.1 was being adopted by the blogosphere in 1999. We tried to get in touch, even when they didn’t work there, but no one responded. So we kept going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we were surprised when a group of people we didn’t know announced, publicly, that they were the new authority on RSS and at the same time introduced a version 1.0 that was incompatible with the format Netscape left behind. Most developers didn’t switch, very few used their format. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were discussions and arguments and lots of hurt feelings on the mail list, but the status quo remained for a couple of years. There was RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0. Most sites used 0.91. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years, we got lucky and found the people at the NYT who could license their proprietary feeds to us to use in our Radio UserLand product. We did a deal with them, and we were allowed to bundle their feeds with Radio. At first we stayed with their proprietary format, wanting to avoid dragging them into the arguments. But then we heard from other pubs that wanted to follow the NYT, and they wanted to know what they should do. We had a new version in the works, 0.92, that had a few new features, but as this was in development, we realized were doing all the work, and 1.0 was just sitting there as an obstacle, it would always appear as what we were doing was less than what they did, when the two really had nothing to do with each other. Since they never consulted us about superceeding the format we were using, we changed 0.92 to 2.0, waited for the flames, but they never came. People were tired of the arguing and there was too much potential in a publishing surface that was shared by bloggers and professional news. So guess what -- RSS 2.0 became the standard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The ex-Netscapers never talked with us, even though their big company no longer existed. We might have worked out something if they had talked with us as equals. But I guess we weren't good enough for them? Hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don’t care if they claim they created RSS, I've never claimed to be the inventor, and I don't there's much value in that -- and frankly I think The NY Times had more to do with its success than any of us. If they hadn’t decided to jump in simply because they liked my little company, RSS would be nothing but a bunch of geeks arguing about who did what about something no one cared about. We might be reminiscing about what might have happened if we could only work with each other and considered each others’ perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To this day, decades later, they still won't talk to us. But I guess from their point of view we had no right to use the supposedly open format their defunct company had left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a different view of the web. It is not made of companies, it’s made of people. Companies can use the web, but they can’t own it. And I suggest that the people here no matter where they work now or in the past understand that there are other points of view. No matter how big your company is or was, you are still just people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have worked for big prestigious companies and organizations too. So what. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so you all sent me a message by taking something I created and was proud of and called it your own without saying where you got it. You can do that, and hopefully this is the end of the vendetta. You can feel you got the win you are entitled to. You caused the pain you were hoping to. So now can we finally put the past behind us? Imho we have much bigger problems to solve and that can only happen if people work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can agree that RSS has done a lot of good for a lot of people. It isn't perfect. But it deserves a little peace and quiet, that I actually thought it had achieved. From here-on, let's try to make it better, not take things out of it for our own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How about a virtual handshake and finally put the past behind us?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When Paramount said firing Colbert was financial, I think they were telling the truth. Unless they dumped Colbert the $8 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_of_Skydance_Media_and_Paramount_Global&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with the Ellisons wouldn't happen. So it was Colbert or $8 billion. They went for the money. Pretty sure it's the same thing with ABC and Kimmel.</description>

I was explaining how I wanted to see a whole market of editors. You could see them as &quot;For WordPress&quot; but there's another way to look at them. They're plug-in replacements for the dreaded &quot;tiny little textboxes&quot; we see in twitter-like systems. Those awful little things. We know so many ways to make better editors. Now imagine that we store your Mastodon posts in WordPress documents (we do). And you see how the pieces start to fit together. Think of WordPress as the command line of the social web. And it really will be the web, not a promise of someday maybe being the web. It's like a Wordle puzzle. You have to move the parts around until you see a picture develop. Another fun thing, WordPress has a great simple REST api that's been around since 2017, and it covers most of the product functionality and is debugged, scaled and stable. It probably is the simplest API for ActivityPub. Now does that blow your mind? This is how you know this is the web, because your mind keeps exploding once you realize the things you could do just by connecting two things together and it works because they interop. Matthias has been working on this stuff since 2008. Our paths didn't cross until earlier this year.</description>

			<description>A bunch of new people are trying out FeedLand news products. I haven't looked at them in a long time. I'm glad they're looking, but most of my demo news products were broken. Oy. It was hard to untangle. It should be a lot easier, and next time I can dig in and do it over I think it will be. Anyway as I convert my demos, I'll list them here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mlbriver.com/&quot;&gt;mblriver.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://politics.newsriver.org/&quot;&gt;politics.newsriver.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggers.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;bloggers.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dave.podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;dave.podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is great at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt;. Describe the icon you want and in a few iterations you have it, even if it's not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I would have killed to have this a few years ago, before FA came out. This is the best of both -- use FA if they have the right icon, design your own if they don't. It also makes me think that now perhaps SVG-based user interfaces are within the realm of possibility. CSS is no way to design UIs. I have a podcast in the pipe about this. If you want to know what I mean, look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/misc/quickdrawApiSummary.pdf&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/19/152802.html&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>To people who read my blog. If you have a quick thought about something you read here, it's ok if you send me an email. It should be short and not personal, if it adds some info or perspective that might be interesting, or if you just agree feverishly (not so much if you disagree, please) drop me a line. My return address on the nightly emails is my real email address. And you can find the address on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=about&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. Also sometime soon I think there will be a way to read my blog inside WordLand, so you can post a response to something I wrote, on your own blog, and I can get a link to it. I think this is the best of both worlds. You maintain the integrity of your blog, all your comments are in the same place, and if I think my readers would benefit, I can link it into my blog. I don't think we need comments, in other words. I think our blogs are powerful enough with some new code.</description>

It's from 1996, I was reporting from a tech conference I was at where there were all angry men on stage threatening everyone else. They may not have known they were doing that, but it was awful. And so different from the web we were just beginning to understand at that time. I'm going to start going through the posts that I remember making a difference at the time. No better way for me to remember what the web is, going back to these memories when it was all fresh and new, before the leaders of tech realized what was going on. Google didn't ship for another two years. It probably wasn't even in development at the time. Yet I think the last section is a good anthem for the web, for those of us who think it's time to cut pop all the bullshit off the stack and get back to our roots.</description>

No better way for me to remember what the web is, going back to these memories when it was all fresh and new, before the leaders of tech realized what was going on. Google didn't ship for another two years. It probably wasn't even in development at the time. Yet I think the last section is a good anthem for the web, for those of us who think it's time to cut pop all the bullshit off the stack and get back to our roots." created="Mon, 15 Sep 2025 15:07:23 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/05/13/modernTimes.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15.html#a150723"/>
