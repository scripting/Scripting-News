Two take-aways for Democrats. 1. Avoid NPR politics. 2. Appeal to college-educated white men. Most of them vote Republican, but with Walz on the ticket, they have a special ambassador, he represents that straight-talking country folk are part of the Democratic coalition. It's still true that white voters are the majority. Get a small number to vote Democratic could be enough to win the election. It never is about policy. It's about whether you are like them. That's what it means to avoid NPR politics. And btw, imho -- getting the press to like you might not be good. I wonder if the Dems would ever have the courage to sever itself from the journos. Imagine Harris saying &quot;If the press says we're bad you know that means we're good.&quot; She could say that in her big interview. 😀</description>

The oppressor in a fascist state doesn't need you to love them, so long as you don't love anyone else. The NYT isn't trying to make us love Trump, that's impossible. But they are trying to make us not fall in love with Harris. I doubt they foresaw that possibility. But our feelings about Harris are very much love. The NYT is our only master, they must think. There's no room for us to love someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or brother. I don't know. As I said it doesn't matter why. That's their problem. Our problem is to get them out of the way.</description>

			<description>The NYT et al aren't even doing a fair job of covering the election as a horserace, because they're making sure it's a virtual tie, so even if our team has overwhelming power, speed and depth, and gets on base in every at bat and plays by the rules, our odds are no better than the other team.</description>

			<title>The status of Twitter's API</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a developer from before. A few bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My linkblog now reliably works on &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.masto.land/@dave&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out it's still there, and there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; that connects to it for Node apps. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It took me a few hours to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543&quot;&gt;support for Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; server app which is how my software connects to all the various services. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally doable. It's already factored that way internally.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should probably write &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md&quot;&gt;some docs&lt;/a&gt; for it too. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api&quot;&gt;deal with Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is that it's free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it enough for a community of users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren't we're going to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

The last time I did any work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx 1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database, verbs, user interface -- for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and now -- a lot of software has been written, and I'm only looking at a fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and Electron. And I have to say I'm totally enjoying reading about what they've done. I'm learning about evolution of technology, a facet of development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed through a tunnel in time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The problem with the state-by-state abortion laws that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/politics/donald-trump-abortion-2024/index.html&quot;&gt;Trump says&lt;/a&gt; he favors: 1. The women in states that ban abortion who will die as a result of the bans, and many more who will be severely injured, and all will have their freedoms severely restricted. 2. He's lying. When Congress passes a national abortion ban he'll sign it and boast about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371&quot;&gt;of course&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I'm trying to teach ChatGPT how to do sidebar art. So far, it's not a great student. But I have hope. My instructions for the image in the post in the sidebar for the previous post: &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; is the motto of the United States. Out of many one. I would like a simple picture of an eagle with this motto over its head, in the same style it is in on the back of a quarter coin.</description>

			<description>This is how I explained what sidebar art is: There's a certain kind of art I need to create with you. I call it &quot;sidebar art&quot; -- they are images between 75 and 135 pixels wide. The content is on a transparent background. They are designed to fit in the right margin of my blog at scripting.com. Please remember this definition, so you can help me create new sidebar art.</description>

			<title>She is perfect</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;VP Harris gave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbUlKy1D7k&quot;&gt;best speech&lt;/a&gt; I've ever heard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were some great speeches at the DNC. Michelle Obama stood out. Bill Clinton, of course. But it was her show, President Kamala's, and she stole it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She's perfect for our time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A prosecutor running against a convicted felon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A first generation American running against candidate who vilifies immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A woman running against a candidate who tried to enslave women. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A brilliant orator running against an incomprehensible bully.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why wasn't she so impressive when she ran in 2019? Near as I can tell it wasn't the right time or circumstances. She needed the focus to be on her. Whatever it was, she is &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt; for our time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was blown away by AOC's speech on Monday, and thought she's going to be a great president someday. And then on the last day, here's exactly what I was dreaming of. A grown-up version of AOC. Every bit as inspiring, as wonderful, as perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She could be a combination of FDR and Lincoln. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She must be the next president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And she's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/08/19/kamala-harris-berkeley-homes&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; Berkeley! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ignore the NYT, part 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling this thread is going to go a long way, maybe all the way. Maybe the last Ignore the NYT note will be &quot;The NYT has been put out of its misery&quot; in which case &quot;Ignore the NYT&quot; will be what everyone does, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Or maybe the last one will be when the owners of the NYT remember that the function of news is to simply report on what happened, and stop trying to control events. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Anyway -- today's ITNYT story goes like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure Trump has a negative net worth. That's what the trial in NY was about, the one which he was convicted on 34 counts of fraud which included lying to creditors about the value of collateral for loans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump borrows money to pay off creditors he borrowed money from to pay off other creditors. This has been going on for many years. It's probably why he's such close friends with Putin (or wishes he was) because a daddy like Putin can play the role of Trump's actual daddy used to play, ie bailing him out from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump:_The_Art_of_the_Deal&quot;&gt;bullshit deals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a Ponzi type pyramid. He's probably been filing fraudulent statements about the value of various real estate he owns for a lot longer than we know. But he got caught and now hopefully he will go to jail for what he's been doing because it's quite illegal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/20/us/dnc-fact-check/take-it-from-an-actual-billionaire-trump-is-rich-in-only-one-thing-stupidity?smid=url-share&quot;&gt;this fact-check&lt;/a&gt;, relies on Forbes' opinion of Trump's net worth -- which is based on the value of his Truth Social stock (good for them for not falling for the same bullshit the banks did). But that's a pretty weak foundation, too, btw -- given that Trump probably couldn't squeeze a billion dollars out of that stock without crashing the value of the stock, in other words, come on -- that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In any case, there's a good argument to be made that Trump's negative net worth in everything but Truth Social stock on a balance sheet would negate even the full value of his stock. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why I feel bad about Biden</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/22/whyIFeelBadAboutWhatHappenedToPresidentBidenInAPersonalWay.m4a&quot;&gt;17 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: You can skip the first five minutes, it's a long preamble on a different subject. I left it in because it's interesting imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that what happened to Joe Biden in the debate is like something that happened to me almost ten years ago when I was turning 60. I tell the story in this podcast. It's still possible he was the best choice to go against Trump. We'll know soon enough. But there's something to learn here. No one wants their life to be over. No one wants to be thanked. They want you to let them keep going. The thing is that all through life people say you can't do what you then go on to do. It happens over and over. One day, after a life of accomplishment, you realize everyone refers to you in the past tense, but you're still here, you want to keep doing the stuff you do so well. But they won't let you. That's why I feel bad about what happened with President Biden, because I've had the experience myself. Anyway what's done is done, we all have to get behind soon-to-be President Harris. And stand behind her as she is attacked, and they try to get rid of her. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the substance of this podcast, which I recorded yesterday, doesn't start until 5:25. Up until then it's a rambling story about Fox News and how a little truth slipped out when they covered the assassination attempt on Trump a few weeks ago. You can skip over that part if you don't find it interesting, but I hope you do listen to the part when I had an experience that may have been like Biden's at the debate, and how it was probably just a panic attack -- these things happen -- our candidates are people, and they have bodies that do strange things sometimes. No matter what I feel for Biden and that's the story I wanted to tell here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks&quot;&gt;most powerful political statement&lt;/a&gt; I've ever heard. &quot;Who's going to tell Trump the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs.&quot; The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or another, we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; changed. America in 2024 is vastly different from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my feet are planted in, we realize that there isn't a black America and a white America, there's just one America. We finally have come to accept ourselves as we have been all along.</description>

I would love to hook up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/dwPocketcastSubscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; from PocketCasts to dave.podcatch.com, so that I could add to the website from my freaking phone. Make it really easy for me to pitch a great podcast feed to my friends. But I can only export my feeds, I can't create a dynamic link between the two. If I ran a popular podcatch app like Pocketcasts, I would open up my outbound subscription list, and vie to be the default place people come to subscribe to podcasts. If a few of my users were geeks and visionaries, they could start telling other vendors they should hook up to my source lists, so they can use Pocketcasts to subscribe. One place to subscribe is way better than many. If you think things like that can't happen, think again. How did you all come to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for your subscription lists? It's because someone volunteered to go first, and the users of that product demanded that other products support the format. It still amazes me that there's an interchange format there, but we've barely begun to tap into the power there.</description>

I'll try to remember not to do that in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've noticed I spend less time programming, I go more slowly and carefully because now I can know a lot more about each problem I'm solving, and use the packages I build on, jQuery, MySQL, Node, the browser, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, Frontier, to greater advantage. A new kind of programming is possible, and it's better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I go into some detail in this podcast about how the process works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interested in hearing similar stories from other developers using ChatGPT or something like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ignore the NY Times</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in comparison to the &lt;i&gt;president&lt;/i&gt; who was about to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence next to Harris is almost always awkward. He's taller, and moves a lot. I noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I'm not sure that pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a sugar high.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don't pretend they aren't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment speech about them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To the extent we can, it's time to push them aside. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat over and over, &quot;Ignore the NY Times.&quot; I'm going to paste it in 25 times now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I do a daily episode of the adventures of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wordle+Kitty&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt; as art I do with ChatGPT, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2314356502105075&amp;set=a.113966572144090&amp;notif_id=1724164406352558&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. There often is a NY Times headline in the image, saying something silly like how prisons are dealing with an influx of convicted house pets (like the kitten). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; the NYT is reporting on how the kitten loves lasagna, and of course how cute she is (it's important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful! Keeping me entertained while we try to get through this election. If I'm forced to accept lies from the NYT, without any voice given to opposition, they might as well be lies that entertain me! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kitty in prison, via Facebook.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wonder if the NYT minds that we think of them as no more straight than Fox News. They've fallen really far, and have so far shown they totally don't care if we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for Living Videotext begins with one of our slogans. It was a joke, and meant to keep us humble, so we listen to users. It was one of many such slogans. LVT made some important contributions to the networks we use today. Wikipedia should talk about that first, show some respect, for crying out loud. Otherwise, except for that snipe up front, the account is actually pretty accurate.</description>

			<description>It's nice to see the DNC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-democratic-national-convention-is-giving-influencers-media-credentials-for-the-first-time-why-both-campaigns-are-pivoting-to-social-first-strategies-110059052.html&quot;&gt;including influencers&lt;/a&gt; this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html&quot;&gt;at the DNC in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

It was a good sentiment, but it apparently was not from Reeves. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@andypiper@macaw.social/112995751255063774&quot;&gt;Andy Piper&lt;/a&gt; for catching this.

			<title>Elon bought the airport</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world hub like Atlanta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-london-heathrow-lhr&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; or Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a network of airports, like the ones served by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/cheap-flight-destinations&quot;&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought, but it's not as much of a hub yet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-orlando-mco&quot;&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-frankfurt-fra&quot;&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it's where most of the traffic already goes. It's quite possibly not running that smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction, huge traffic, broken systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/14/weTryHarder.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;When I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel funding for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;LVT&lt;/a&gt;, I asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they're not going away. Companies that large don't disappear. After 40 years of experience in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very rarely disappear. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles#Counterculture_of_the_1960s_and_1970s&quot;&gt;Laurel Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Or who knows? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's a high probability that Musk's company will be the market leader for the forseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reliable app storage over time is not here yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an interesting design challenge either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000 characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what we've settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From a tweet to a long blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server and network technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In every way it'll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to create structures of writing over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that last sentence is the gotcha -- &lt;i&gt;over time. &lt;/i&gt;It's the frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there's no way for me, as an individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month. A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I started an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; writing on GitHub. It's still just a fraction of my writing, I'm not doing anything like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I've managed to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month, which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I guess for the project I'm doing I will again use GitHub to mirror the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for this purpose, or something much better comes along.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for enough time to present the &lt;i&gt;illusion&lt;/i&gt; of persistence. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Feeds for Threads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kvell&quot;&gt;kvelling&lt;/a&gt; the other day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-wOWuDJUU6&quot;&gt;about rss.app&lt;/a&gt; and how they have feeds for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; accounts. They do. But there are two caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.app/pricing&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $9.99 per month for 15 feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people's budgets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The second concern is more serious. It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. This is not right, and it's not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it. There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter isn't over</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn't watch reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even though I guess the rest of the world thinks he's big in NY.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German in Queens, but not that rare either.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think this is over are fooled, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/18/inciting-rioters-in-britain-was-a-test-run-for-elon-musk-just-see-what-he-plans-for-america&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in today's Guardian for another perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism is very important part of how our country works yet there is no accountability, no checks and balances, no requirement of transparency. There isn’t even a mechanism to disagree with them. most of the time they have the only voice. We don’t even know what they’re trying to do, what their goals are.</description>

We've had to live with journalism that tries to give lies equal stature to actual news, but the two just don't mix. What happens if your news is half lies, the users don't believe &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; you carry. This was predicted, in 2016 when it was clear that Putin's Russia was heavily influencing American journalism. They had developed their techniques in Ukraine in previous years, and the Ukraine press and government came to the same conclusion we're now arriving at -- stop at the first lie, turn the microphone off. That's the main rule, main change that has to take place now, in advance of the November election. They may not do it, but at least now we all understand that what they're doing is stupid, wrong, even corrupt. No matter what they don't get to keep their rep if they are laundering lies.</description>

			<description>I would almost add a rule that journalists should have respect for critics, we'll save that for the rules of 2030 if there is any journalism left.</description>

Heard it just now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/articles/the-makeorbreak-issues-of-the-2024-election&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; after a Republican was using &quot;talking points&quot; that were &quot;misleading.&quot; Of course lies &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; misleading, but they are also lies. What these reporters hope to do (I guess) is convince you that the lies they just broadcast don't reflect poorly on them. If they said &quot;that guy just lied five times&quot; you'd have to wonder why they included it. What's wrong with them. But if they just were &quot;misleading&quot; oh I guess that's okay. Same thing happened in an otherwise pretty honorable &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3yKwJE4&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post. &quot;When not one but multiple rants call 'into question not only his fitness for office but his basic cognitive abilities,' the media’s refusal to convey Trump’s unfitness amounts to misleading the public.&quot; No. It's not just misleading, it's deadly -- to the reputation of the publication that didn't convey what they saw clearly with their own two eyes. The rest of the Rubin piece is worth reading. I expect she softened her criticism because she has to work with the editors at the Post who decided to keep cutting Trump slack. You and I don't have that problem. The news industry in the US must be scrapped and replaced with one that tells the truth, otherwise what's the point.</description>
