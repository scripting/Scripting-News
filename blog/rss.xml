It is not represented online 7-by-24-by-12 every year, not just presidential election years. Democrats, when you lose it's because you didn't show up. It's happened three times so far, at least. We could have led here because most of the innovators in this space vote Democratic, but the leadership doesn't listen. The voters could get to know all the stars of the parties. People were right when they said they didn't know Harris. It's time to let the leaders rise from the net, not just from the insiders. This is how you do it.</description>

			<description>I'd like to hear from tech vendors, asap, which ones will help American voters learn what's true independent of whatever &quot;truth&quot; the government wants us to believe? Who will stand with the people? A good question for all of us to ask. Ask news orgs the same question.</description>

One way to do it is with my product &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. It manages news streams for feeds you subscribe to. I think every publication should share news from feeds they depend on, experts they quote, other news sources they read. We can build our own networks this way. The advantage of this approach is that it is truly decentralized and not at all complicated to use. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news stream&lt;/a&gt; I provide for readers of my blog. It's the most popular feature on the site. With FeedLand you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.feedland.com/newsproducts.md&quot;&gt;create your own&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Democratic mistakes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've actually written a lot, but haven't wanted to publish most of it. So many reasons why the Dems lost. Maybe I should just list them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden shouldn't have run again. There would have been a primary. Given the result of the election this week, we should have found out what support each candidate had with voters. We didn't get to choose the candidate. That said Harris ran a fantastic campaign. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden should not have shut down his campaign website. Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. &lt;b&gt;We were not part of governing&lt;/b&gt;. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama. This is probably the biggest single mistake the Dems keep making.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We needed a prosecutor at the top of Justice. I don't know what Garland actually did, but I'm sure it will all be swept out by whoever is Trump's AG. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Men's votes need to be sought and welcomed, specifically. So much has been done to alienate male voters, which is why so many voted for Trump. We could have had a bunch of them this year, if we had only spoken to them with respect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if we can reboot the Democrats as an opposition party given all these problems. Whatever comes next is going to perform very differently from the party that lost this election. If we try to do it again the same old way, it will fail even worse. I think everyone knows this by now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In 2016, on the night of Election Day, when it was obvious Trump would win, before taking a Xanax and going to sleep, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, that my friend Chuck Shotton &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social/post/3labvjcfh2j2k&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; I should run again. Rather than doing that, I'll quote the important part. &quot;I don't think it's about economics, I think it's about change happening too fast. And the Trump voters had the power to bring it to a screeching halt, they saw the chance and took it.&quot;</description>

			<description>First thing -- &lt;b&gt;Don't shut down the campaign&lt;/b&gt;. We must keep communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down. Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing. And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero after election, whether we win or lost.</description>

			<description>Be generous with all classes of people, by gender, age, race, religion, whatever is used to divide us. Stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=vilifying&quot;&gt;vilifying&lt;/a&gt; men. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/11/05/don-lemon-james-carville-democrats-stupid-wokeness-newday-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;Carville was right&lt;/a&gt;. There's no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat for all our problems. It's no accident that the Repubs own the men.

			<description>Speaking of Carville, &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/election-day-special-edition-feat-james-carville/id1523896927?i=1000675748922&quot;&gt;yesterday's Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Carville as the only guest was the &lt;b&gt;best podcast&lt;/b&gt; I've ever heard. I recommended it yesterday as inspirational. Now that we know the outcome of the election, it's a marker of where we were before the results were known. A world that no longer exists. But like stories written in 2016, the markers are useful to see where we once were and how we got here, and what we can learn from what happened between. I wish it had turned out the way these two great friends thought it should have. But it didn't. But there was a hint that they knew what wouldn't work this time. No spoilers.</description>

			<description>Ben Thompson wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt; newsletter: &quot;What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective it’s a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!&quot; I wrote in 2017, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;some Repub would buy Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now. When I begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612&quot;&gt;didn't&lt;/a&gt; miss this.</description>

			<description>Also to the Twitter founders, amassing that much power and centralizing it as Twitter did, had a cost that we're paying now. But it's very hard to stop when the juggernaut is rolling.

			<description>Speaking of Musk, maybe he will temper Trump's desire for retribution. It may be a vain hope, but I'll cling to it anyway. Doing business in a world of retribution might not be too conducive to the creativity needed to run innovative tech businesses. A climate of fear doesn't inspire great software. I know the quality of products Musk makes, I own and love my Tesla Model Y. Best car I've ever owned or driven.</description>

			<description>Final note (I think). The pain you feel at first may abate. It did for me. I had pushed down memories of 2020 and 2021. It was a horror show, and Trump was the main character. So the first thing I had to deal with is that I don't want to remember that. Too painful. But once I realized that's not where we are right now, it's a totally different situation, that's when the creative impulse rose as the pain receded. We have one short term thing to do -- keep the campaign running, and long term we have to recognize division we add, and counteract it. We are the party that welcomes everyone regardless or race, religion, country of origin, age or gender. &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of them. No exceptions. The election result represents big change. And it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;good time&lt;/a&gt; to make more changes.</description>

			<title>Rebooting the news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My opinion: At this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know the basic rules of journalism, imho that's much easier than the know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/&quot;&gt;view from nowhere&lt;/a&gt;, trying to understand what they're writing about. They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt; and I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;series of podcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer. I think that's the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on current events. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this, the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn't now be owned by Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Could a Musk buy Bluesky?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at will.&quot; It's a good practice, and while I completely support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community, and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that their pitch is a scam, and they're building value in a user base that they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the founders may have already sold some of their stock in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a&quot;&gt;latest investment round&lt;/a&gt; which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they're open, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the only way to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; do it is to &quot;provide a download that you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of confusion.&quot; (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too much into their promise of being open.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw had an open API too, and it's pretty good, but they never offered the option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else build one of those? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In early 2017 I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a president. This value wasn't on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it could possibly gain him control of part of the US government's $6 trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.. He could probably start borrowing against it the day after the election is called for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it's possible they have a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that's why it's a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would sell out even if they didn't have to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People may question my credentials as a language designer. I've designed a very innovative system that unfortunately the academics don't think is worth studying. It's utterly ridiculous. Who says you can only learn from systems developed at big companies or universities. I cover a lot of ground, it's true -- no one gave me permission to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn't feel I needed permission. Or funding for that matter. I think what happened is Apple positioned us as less significant than their system scripting language, and people just accepted that, when Frontier is a far superior system. Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier&quot;&gt;ideas are there&lt;/a&gt; anyway, and you're welcome to learn from them.</description>

			<title>My friend who I don't understand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most depressing thing last night for me was reading that a longtime friend voted for the worst candidate they've ever voted for because the other one was worse. They wouldn’t say who they actually voted for. This is what we’ll be left with as a country when all this is done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave another $100 to Harris to compensate, and of course voted straight Democratic on Thursday. Unlike my friend I was proud to vote for her. The alternative, after what we lived through between 2017 and 2021, to choose to go through that again, hard to imagine the horror.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course that’s assuming he voted for Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Unfortunately the only place you can read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/pfbid0VqEwJyLQQ7Qyhu9Zoz6ivz35APRfvLMKp7wBZvR2pDRTVdLwf1QR8Xh646faRJ1Zl&quot;&gt;Dan Conover piece&lt;/a&gt; is on Facebook about the failure of the NY Times and Washington Post to adequately defend democracy. He says something I had not seen elsewhere. &quot;We're not talking about HuffPo or Salon here. We're talking about the last two 'unique nationals' standing in American print journalism. Institutions with long and storied histories. Both took the same test at the same time, and both failed it.&quot; I'd add that all other journalism usually follows their lead, but that may be finally changing.</description>

			<description>Meanwhile, it's amazing that both CNN and MSNBC have gotten serious about covering the reality of Trump 2.0 after being very unserious for the last year. It's as if after rejecting Joe Biden, months later they realized they rejected the wrong guy.</description>

We think the Democrats are the opposite, they are inclusive, everyone is welcome there. But that's not true. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5154873/what-explains-the-big-gender-gap-between-supporters-of-trump-and-harris&quot;&gt;NPR piece&lt;/a&gt; touches on it, gingerly, because it's the third rail in non-Republican politics. Because it's one of the divisions that's maintained by people who are mostly Democrats. If you want to know if you're part of the problem, measure your own feelings when you find out what it's about. And then listen, carefully to the words. It might be hard to hear because I think most people who do this don't think they do, or they're justified in doing it. They don't want to look here. But the pragmatic reason to focus on this is that in future elections, assuming we have them, if we can make an effort to not do this, we could get enough Republican votes to switch to make real change possible. They might even become our most vocal supporters. Winning in politics is done by focusing on common interests over division.</description>
