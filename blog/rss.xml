The seasons would come and go, and there would be Dave, still diggin. And of course he would continue to develop software, using some of the greatest tried and true tools, reminding everyone of how great &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; is -- but -- if only it ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22frontier%20on%20linux%22&quot;&gt;on Linux&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; written before ChatGPT. Sometimes, as I read my old code, I wonder how the h*ck I ever figured that out without it.</description>

			<description>Welcome to August. More than half the summer is behind us. We're still here. The shelves in the supermarkets are full of good stuff. We've had about the normal amount of hot weather, a good amount of rain but not too much. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/mets/standings/&quot;&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt; are doing OK. They opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tibetphowoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;Pho restaurant&lt;/a&gt; in Bearsville and it's good. Health, not too bad, all things considered. &lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;</description>
