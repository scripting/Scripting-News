So many of our friends on the web are happy to let Facebook run the new Twitter. What is wrong with you. I don't know any better way to put it. Quitting Twitter is pointless, meaningless, powerless. But not building Threads for Facebook is not meaningless. For once can people look out for the future, keep the window open for independence for writers and developers, and let us try out some new ideas that might not be something Zuckerberg would love? Come on already. This is the saddest moment, when there's so much possibility, and you all are ready to just throw it away. (And no, I don't believe for a minute they're going to do anything that helps the Fediverse. I know the playbook. Saying you'll be open is what you do until you dominate, then it's just business. Truth is it's always just business, and saying you're going to be open at this stage of network development &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good for business.)</description>

			<description>Starting in September or so I start thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many people care, but it's a good thing for me to do -- to review what makes a blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me -- obviously. We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved. People think &quot;well it's just me and I don't matter&quot; -- which is totally true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least &lt;i&gt;they'll&lt;/i&gt; know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value, which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last year I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915&quot;&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; Heather Cox Richardson, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack site&lt;/a&gt; is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different times, and if I'm up and in the mood, I'll spend a few minutes with HCR and it's always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/06/17/mlkButton.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Before moving on to this year's BOTY, I thought HCR could help figure out how we could move past merely reporting on Trump's danger to democracy, something that was clear going back to 2015, the news could start reporting on The Resistance, what we're doing to prevent the end of democracy. And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy things for them to write about! We're not doing that. It started out well, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.&quot;&gt;Woman's March on January 20, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but that was it. We can and must keep showing up, and I'm not advocating huge marches, I want to see neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk (if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music, food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not against something but &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; all of us. All we have to do is figure out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our democracy would be in the best shape it's been in probably since inception. I had another idea that's worth considering. We should all wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a photo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;Martin Luther King&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but it didn't catch on. If we all did, it's omission would be noticed, and we'd know there's someone we should talk with about America and offer them a free button, nicely, if they'll put it on right now. Anyway, I'm putting this out there again, and I'll keep doing it.</description>

			<description>There's an interesting recent development in the world of feeds and blogs -- blogs that are only feeds. Designed to be read in feed readers of all sizes and shapes. I have a few of these myself. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; for example. Also, FeedLand provides an outbound &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?myfeed&quot;&gt;feed to every user&lt;/a&gt;, which meets all the qualifications of a feed-only blog.</description>

			<title>Working together for writers</title>

If we want independent writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I can refer back to it. I really don't have a good way yet to find stuff I've written. It's all there on the web, for crying out loud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very little of that. It's amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by other developers. This is a huge problem, it's why we've always been dominated by big companies who don't care about what we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start with a search engine for bloggers. I'll help. And let's do lots of them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>General note</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for some reason I don't find out about the work until it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there's a reason -- I want to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course I'll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How we got here</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you through that. Now that it works on phones, I can see how nice it is to be able to skim the news while you're out and about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you're working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been some huge ones this year. The product's identity system had to be replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/&quot;&gt;Automattic VIP server&lt;/a&gt; required fairly large pieces of the software to be rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There's a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime environment doesn't include local storage. Everything has to be stored in a database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; we had to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with this product. And one more thing, let's get this mofo working on mobile devices as it was meant to, which turned out to be not as hard as I imagined, and very nice to have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new version of the software with all the new code turned on is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt;. That's the version that's running on Automattic's servers, and should be able to scale to far more users. The docs aren't converted yet, but the software is basically the same. You should read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of the docs, at least, so you aren't surprised to find out that your subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product, it's more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see what would happen if instead of building something complicated around conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see where we could go with that. That's what FeedLand is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I can't believe how fast Automattic's system is.

				<source:outline text="First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you through that.

				<source:outline text="When you're working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been some huge ones this year. The product's identity system had to be replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/&quot;&gt;Automattic VIP server&lt;/a&gt; required fairly large pieces of the software to be rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There's a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime environment doesn't include local storage. Everything has to be stored in a database." created="Sun, 10 Dec 2023 14:13:04 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/10.html#a141304"/>
				<source:outline text="All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; we had to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with this product.

That's the version that's running on Automattic's servers, and should be able to scale to far more users. The docs aren't converted yet, but the software is basically the same. You should read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of the docs, at least, so you aren't surprised to find out that your subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product, it's more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see what would happen if instead of building something complicated around conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see where we could go with that. That's what FeedLand is." created="Sun, 10 Dec 2023 14:09:35 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/10.html#a140935"/>

So if you're using FeedLand on a phone, sometime in the next 24-48 hours you may see a significant improvement. I will of course write a blog post about it with screen shots when it does become available.</description>

I think Facebook's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads service&lt;/a&gt; is poised to replace Twitter in this role, once they add an API that allows pubs to post links to their stories on their service. We will, in a few weeks or months, wish we had proactively formed a non-Facebook news service, a place where by convention we know we can get links to the hot stories as they become available. I think Bluesky is the perfect place to go for this now, but it would require the company behind the service to work with news orgs and independent software developers to quickly build the network. It's possible. They already have the API, we just need to do a little marketing. It's even possible without the help of Bluesky itself, if a few leaders from the news industry got involved, either individuals like Jay Rosen, Emily Bell or Jeff Jarvis, or Richard Gingras who leads news at Google (who thankfully doesn't have a horse in this race) or a big news org or two, acting proactively against turning this valuable space over to a much untrusted big tech company like Facebook. (I don't call them Meta, I think that was a con to give them cover for exactly a move like this, who would ever trust Facebook with such power after what happened in the 2016 election, but &lt;i&gt;Meta&lt;/i&gt; is just confusing enough.)</description>

A fair price imho. I advertised I'd be willing to pay $5 to read all the articles in the special issue about the second Trump presidency. Driving one hour round trip raises the price considerably. 2. A couple of readers wrote to say that the full text of the Atlantic is available in their RSS 2.0 feed. I knew that, but that isn't the issue. It's very generous of The Atlantic to offer their publication that way, but I'm not looking for a free ride, just a fair deal. I might want to subscribe to The Atlantic, what better way to offer it than on a piece-price basis. I might end up paying more than the subscription price. If I was doing that regularly you bet I'd subscribe. 3. I really dislike the term &quot;micropayments.&quot; It's disrespectful of the customer's money, and businesses that do that don't deserve our patronage. When you add up the per-article expense of great pubs like The New Yorker or The Atlantic there would be nothing micro about the money I'd spend. It's the commitment I want to avoid. Magazines are notoriously difficult to unsub from. I'd rather pay more and stay anonymous to them.

I think it's actually a bigger story, because realistically, it's probably good journalism but won't do anything to prevent a second Trump term, where hearing him explain why they have such a bizarre economic model might help them try another approach and thus provide greater service, and very likely increase their revenue because it would give readers a way to ease into subscribing.</description>

			<description>Goldberg said they are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/797774d7-4770-46b8-863d-b7c62da4261c&quot;&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, they're journalists. Well then my question is what good are you exactly and why are you using up all the airtime? Why is NPR even bothering to interview you. He said it clearly, he was just trying to save his conscience for after the Nazis came to power in the US. We have bigger issues than Jeffrey Goldberg's conscience. Why doesn't NPR and The Atlantic go out and find The Freaking Resistance and introduce us to them. My grandfather said something to me when I was a little boy, with such clarity, I can never forget it. He said David, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you need to go up on the roof with a gun, and shoot them. He knew. He didn't say &quot;David, run&quot; or &quot;David, write an article in The Atlantic so you have a clear conscience.&quot; He said I should fight. With guns. That was the lesson he learned from his experience. So where is our Resistance? What the F are we waiting for?</description>

And it's still repeated as if it were gospel -- it's a typical response when I beg for a standard that is more realistic, that incorporates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;basic features of web writing&lt;/a&gt;: simple styles, links, optional titles, enclosures, the ability to edit and unlimited length. The fallacy of this response is that you are free to write however you want, if you feel your ideas are better communicated in short messages, go ahead. I want to use all the tools in my writing. And if you don't want to read all that I write or any of it, there are tools that make that easy. So everyone wins, and you don't have to try to impose your ideas of religiously pure writing on anyone but yourself.</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary&quot;&gt;corrollary&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; philosophy is that I should be able to use any writing tool I like to post to the web, and have it flow where ever I want. The idea of being forced to use a teeny little edit box to write my wonderful prose is as silly as bunding a word processor with a printer, and forcing you to use that editor if you want to print it with that printer. If I sent you a document written for my Brand X printer but you had Brand Y, sorry -- you can't read it. I'm at the point in my life where I have to explain to young folk how great things were when I was their age, but it's true in this case, when I was in my 20s and 30s, there were simple standards for text, and you could print documents produced by any writing tool on any printer. And as a result a wide variety of writing tools and editors were available, and there was lots of innovation in a very short period of time because everyone had competition they could learn from and had to keep up with. Now there's no reason for Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, Bluesky, Mastodon or whatever to improve their editors because after all you don't have any choice. That's another important facet of textcasting that we borrow from podcasting -- lots of ways to create and lots of ways to listen mean things &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; get better. With lock-in, they can't.</description>

			<title>Why we want feeds in Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My old friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22chuck+shotton%22&quot;&gt;Chuck Shotton&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social&quot;&gt;showed up&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love Chuck. We've been through a lot together over a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had a ton of fun in the early days of the web on the Mac. Chuck wrote the HTTP server we all used. And he loved Frontier, so we made our products work incredibly well together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Those were the days! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, of course I immediately followed Chuck in Bluesky, but then I realize, I can also follow him &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Amrwheat.bsky.social&quot;&gt;in FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; because thanks to John Spurlock, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:mrwheat.bsky.social&quot;&gt;we have feeds&lt;/a&gt; for every freaking Bluesky user. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock&quot;&gt;Spurlock&lt;/a&gt; is a gifted programmer, like Chuck, who thinks creatively and doesn't mind priming the pump of a bootstrap, something Chuck and I have done many times in the past. (Chuck is an largely uncredited contributor to the bootstraps of RSS, XML-RPC, podcasting, object databases, content management systems, hey pretty much everything I've worked on since 1994 or so.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now I get to the point. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to build with confidence on the feed connection with Bluesky. Today I know the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;Bluesky RSS 2.0 feed&lt;/a&gt; is there, but will it be there in the future? I would feel better if the feed support were built-into Bluesky, part of its basic feature set. Another very simple API that gets ideas out of Bluesky and anywhere feeds go, which is, as you know, everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Feeds should be the baseline of compatibility between social media platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Working with Spurlock, we have given Bluesky a huge headstart, a lead in what I hope will be a race to feed support in all the social media apps, to hook them up to the worldwide feed bus. It's a way to get interop without having to concede that any comprehensive API is the winner. Think of RSS 2.0 support at the TCP of social networking, offering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator&quot;&gt;LCD&lt;/a&gt; compatibility to a world that desperately needs one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then after we have that, we can talk about the format of the data we're sending over this network. We have some work to do there too, but luckily the capabilities and limits of RSS 2.0 are a perfect match here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the reason we want it is so we can do more with confidence with Bluesky, integrate it into more systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason the Bluesky people should want it is that it offers a way to interop with all social nets, that will take almost no effort on their part, and there's no guesswork, we already know how to make feeds that will work pretty much everywhere, and it lets them take the lead in what will be an important way to communicate on the net. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the reason it's good for all of us is we can start viewing the web once again as a fully supported writing environment, and let the writers of the world get to work on solving all our problems (of which we have many) and get the freaking technology out of their way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the feed-iverse, it's easier and more low-level than the fed-iverse, and can be implemented in a weekend. And it's fun! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you get two green tiles, you can bask in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I've never gotten it in two, and I don't usually try, and when I do it's usually a mistake, I would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love, self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five green tiles open up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg&quot;&gt;one at a time&lt;/a&gt;.

We're building all kinds of stuff on it. Wish it were in Mastodon, and wish Bluesky would bake it in.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Forget about clubs, what we want is interop, maximally as widely as possible to force the silos to get on board.

			<title>Doc &amp; FeedLand &amp; artcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I pinged Doc the other day saying he should do an artcasting feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doc is in addition to being a prodigious blogger, also is a photo taker and story teller, so he is perfect for artcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/07/29/doc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was then going to think about what would be the easiest way to get him going, and quickly realized the fastest way is Bluesky because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock&quot;&gt;John Spurlock&lt;/a&gt; did it right and his feeds coming out of Bluesky are totally artcasting-compatible. Just like that. (Artcasting is one of those cases where almost everyone was doing it the right way. Absolutely no one invented it, it was just obvious how it should work, obvious to enough people.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to talk about it with A8C people first, because it's also an opportunity to support it in WordPress, or to create a small app that interfaces to WordPress, so it can lead here too. But Doc beat me to it, he posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social/post/3kfnwb6dbf72b&quot;&gt;beautiful picture&lt;/a&gt; of a building site his new hometown to Bluesky, and it appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:dsearls.bsky.social&quot;&gt;his RSS 2.0 feed&lt;/a&gt;, and of course it &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?item=594431&quot;&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social&quot;&gt;in FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; when I subscribed to his feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I added it to my collection of artcasting feeds, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.feedcorps.org/artshow.opml&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?readinglist=https%3A%2F%2Flists.feedcorps.org%2Fartshow.opml&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedcorps=true&quot;&gt;FeedCorps&lt;/a&gt; and his name shows up in the list in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://artshow2.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;artshow app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is how we do it, keep turning the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interop my friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>You can live in places where people do awful disgusting things, I know, I've lived in New Orleans, Berkeley and NYC. Twitter is so huge, this idea that it could disband just like that, well it isn't happening. Maybe it's time for us to say clearly what we expect of a social network and try to influence how they run them. We have these great tools for organizing, one of these days we're going to use them for good, in a serious way. And at this point the users have a lot of power relative to what we've had in the past.</description>

			<description>If I could devote myself fulltime to AI development, first thing I'd do is teach a bot how to generate CSS with high level commands from me. After 15 years of wrangling CSS, I still create messes that are impossible to unravel, the only way to fix it is to start over, and then that gets out of control, and on and on. It would take some patience to establish some basic design patterns, but once designed I could say things like &quot;a little less margin on top of the tabs&quot; and boom that would happen.</description>
