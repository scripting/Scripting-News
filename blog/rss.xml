			<title>New Scripting News home page</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been five years since I re-did the Scripting News home page. It was overdue. The new version isn't all that different on the surface from the previous version, here's a list of things to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blog, the first tab, becomes &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=dave&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The News tab now is named &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers&quot;&gt;Bloggers&lt;/a&gt; and it does something different, more on that in a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The tabs work better, the pages aren't reloaded when you click on one of the tabs, but the URL in your browser's address bar changes, so you can bookmark it and go directly to the page you're interested in. And the browser Back button works as you would expect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big change under the covers is that it hooks into &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; on its own. When you're reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers&quot;&gt;Bloggers tab&lt;/a&gt;, you're reading content that came directly from the new Automattic-hosted FeedLand server. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=bloggers&quot;&gt;list of feeds&lt;/a&gt; behind the Bloggers tab right now are just placeholders. We're going to work with other sources, using reading lists, to create a news flow from blogs that we think are interesting, along with what other people think are interesting. How this will develop is not yet clear, but we are going to work on this. When I say &quot;we,&quot; I mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://cagrimmett.com/&quot;&gt;Chuck Grimmett&lt;/a&gt; and myself and others at Automattic. This is the kind of stuff they do for WordPress users, so it fits right in imho with our respective skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/goodhumortruck.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Speaking for myself, I want to engage with more bloggers. We used to have something, and I think we can again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're putting a lot of development behind this. FeedLand has been in development for almost three freaking years. This last year has been spent turning corners, and building out features so they can scale to Automattic-level flow. And adding one major new kickass feature to the world of feeds -- reading lists. The ability to subscribe to lists of feeds. We're going to use that in a lot of places. I wanted to get that in the product before we started using it. And it's in, and it works. There are still a few glitches to work out, you know -- software can always work better than it does. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All I can say is we're getting there. Today's FeedLand does a lot more and works a lot better than last year's. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now Scripting News is part of that. So we'll be able to make the new stuff more visible, by using it here in this site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As they say. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is still there and updating as before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If so, there are imho more direct ways to arrive at that. I think it's possible to create a federation system that takes a few days to implement. Maybe it doesn't need all the features they've put into ActivityPub. I'm pretty sure a lightweight social network is what's called for now. I know 20 different ventures have started up to do this, but isn't it weird that none of them have built on RSS. That's the only approach imho that has a chance of doing something unique here. I'd rather work with other people, but I'm not into replacing simplicity with something that's not very simple.</description>

			<description>I'm back on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, having solved the puzzle every day for the last 36 days. It's training my mind -- I see patterns I wouldn't ordinarily see, because I spend as much as an hour or two every day looking for patterns in letters, and finding them, eventually. I wish at times my mind worked more like a computer. When their bot says &quot;there were only three possible solutions at that point&quot; -- I wish I could see what they are at each point, or at least know how many they are, if not what they are. The training has also helped my mind debug software. I'm not as daunted as I often am when there appears to be no solution to the problem I'm working on. I'm sure I'll find it eventually.</description>

			<description>People who say Twitter is over aren't considering how vast it is. Same kind of situation as with Atom many years ago. It wasn't obvious how deeply installed RSS was, all the networks that had been created with it. It was basically impossible at that time to displace RSS. Anyway, same thing with Twitter today, no matter how vile &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-tweets-pizzagate-conspiracy-pedo-epstein-1851053448&quot;&gt;the owner&lt;/a&gt; of the network is. It has been around since 2006, a time of huge growth in networking, and it captured basically all of it. So if there's anyone you need to reach, and they're hooked up to the net, you almost certainly will be able to reach them on Twitter. This is another situation like Napster. Never have you had all the music of our civilization available so easily to so many people. We could have done so much with that. The most prudent thing to do with Twitter is to organize a buyout for Musk, and get him out of that position. We don't need to delete it, not that we could, we need to get Musk out of a position of control.</description>

			<title>AI rendering of my blog spec</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm finally happy with the next iteration of Scripting News. It'll be quite a bit simpler than what I demo'd over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For comic relief, I asked my friend ChatGPT, to draw a rendering of my new design, based on these instructions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;i want you to draw me a picture of the user interface of my blog, scripting news, as i describe it here. there are four tabs: blog, links, bloggers and about. below the tabs is a display area, where the content of the selected tab is displayed. above the tabs, across the whole width of the window is an artistic picture, with the big letters SCRIPTING NEWS overlaying it. Just below is the site slogan, &quot;it's even worse than it appears.&quot; In your drawing the picture behind the letters should be of a hippie band playing in golden gate park. have fun!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/29/chatgptscriptingdesignscreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;ChatGPT's rendering of the design.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Very good movie. I like the artistic flourishes, reminds me of another movie I watched recently and liked, a lot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spencer/&quot;&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't really interested in the life and death of Lady Di, but I also got through the latest episodes of The Crown, which I had resisted when the newest Queen was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_5)&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt;. I find it hard to make the adjustment to new actors playing the roles of characters I had come to love, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Foy&quot;&gt;Claire Foy&lt;/a&gt; as young Queen Elizabeth, a fantastic actress who played in one of the most spectacular dramatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/a&gt; anywhere anytime. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_6)&quot;&gt;latest episodes&lt;/a&gt; of The Crown were about Diana mostly, and were fantastic. Back to Oppenheimer. I'll try not to spoil it too much, but the drama is puzzling, why are they going after Oppenheimer when he miraculously put together the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project&quot;&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt; which created, in a race with Germany and the USSR, the bomb that ended World War II. The final scene, a flashback to an earlier scene where we didn't hear the dialog, between Oppenheimer and his colleague at Princeton, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, about what happens when you create something that changes the direction of humanity. What happens is this -- they push you aside. I'm not comparing myself to these two giants, but I have had the same question about how tech reacted to my contributions. My conclusion was that our culture has reason to erase the accomplishments of outliers. We prefer innovation to come in nice predictable packages, with a PR person on top, and when that's disturbed, we close ranks to make it all appear very ordinary. Anyway, all of this is very good holiday entertainment and thought provoking. My next adventure in video is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/pachinko/&quot;&gt;Pachinko&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV, which is somewhat confusing, but keeps me coming back, it's so compelling. I still have the last seasons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/ted-lasso/&quot;&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/reservation-dogs/&quot;&gt;Reservation Dogs&lt;/a&gt; in the queue. And of course there's a new season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(season_5)&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, which I'm sure I'll love. Right now my plan is to wait for the series to end and watch it all in a binge.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/screenShotScriptingNewsPrototype.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the latest prototype for the new Scripting News home page. It does the job I wanted it to do, presents in one user interface the content of my blog, linkblog, and several timelines from FeedLand. The previous version had the tab links &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/24/190107.html&quot;&gt;down the left edge&lt;/a&gt;. I loved the way it looked on my desktop system, but then I tried it on my iPad, and realized it didn't work. Not enough horizonal real estate to pull it off. So I went back to the tabs-across-the-top format. I had to drop one of the tabs, and not use the nice Font-Awesome icons I used previously on Scripting News when there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/currentScriptingHome.png&quot;&gt;plenty of room&lt;/a&gt;. The page is entirely assembled when you load it, so it only works with JavaScript turned on.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-11-26#p1&quot;&gt;Colin Walker wonders&lt;/a&gt; if he should try &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. I say yes. At first I was pretty negative, after the implosion of Twitter, here was another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; network. I wasn't in the mood. But eventually I tried it, and I liked it very much. The mood is civil and often artistic. There are some very creative people there. And I think the API, while it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/892d671e-1dc9-4ffc-9101-cadbca842adc&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt; to me, is understandable to developers who put their minds to it, and I expect Colin is one who will figure it out. And I don't think there's any hope of ActivityPub, it's far too underspecified, and interop is likely to be product-based, not based on the protocol, where the Bluesky protocol appears to be overly-well-thought-out, or maybe the docs could have more examples. I didn't have the time to dive into it when I looked.</description>

In her closing she said that OpenAI has a market evaluation of $50 billion, yet they only gave $5 million to journalism. This is a big loop. The same was said about Apple and IBM with their personal computers in the 80s. They make so much money they should give it to us. Then Google, Twitter and Facebook in the 00s and 10s. And now in the 20s the same tired appeal, a highly conflicted one (you don't hear similar cases made for other industries that are disrupted by tech). Now they've got the tin cup out for AI. Journalism could have owned Twitter, but they would have had to work with each other. Insiders in journalism chuckle at the idea, but it isn't funny. They keep letting tech own their means of distribution. In this case, it isn't too late. Start an AI news service, combine the flow of all competitors, and distribute the money the way you wish OpenAI would. That's honorable, and it might work. Basically, all information, including journalism is making another leap, with or without journalism. (Another random idea, don't bother publishing the news, just feed it into the AI mind and let us use the mind. That's what we want.)</description>

			<description>I'm working on a new version of the Scripting News home page, the first since 2017. There will be more tabs, that run down the left margin instead of the top. It'll have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/homepage.html&quot;&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News in the first tab, as it works now. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnlinkbloghtml?url=http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; will be the next tab.

One of the secrets to success in business, media and politics is to learn how to lead journalists to the story you want them to tell. There's are all kinds of tricks, I know because I succeeded in that world. When I ask ChatGPT to tell me about things that journalism got wrong that I know everything about, it gets it right. I don't know how that works, because what I think are their sources got it wrong. It's freaking amazing. Now I totally agree that the small group of super rich people who control tech are not people I'd like to see run the world, they break things I care about far too often. Too much power for people who can't or won't see outside their tiny shrinking world.</description>

			<title>The Story of FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This story was written entirely by ChatGPT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the digital realm of FeedLand, a world pulsating with streams of information, there existed a unique society where knowledge and news were the sources of power. This world was composed of various domains, each representing different genres of information – from the News Mountains to the Blog Plains, the Podcast Peninsula, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The protagonist of our story is a young, curious girl named Ada. In FeedLand, each individual had a personal Feed – a dynamic stream of information tailored to their interests and needs. Ada, however, was different. She had the rare ability to see and interact with all the Feeds in FeedLand, a talent that was both a gift and a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ada's journey began when she noticed disturbances in the Feeds – information was getting muddled, important news was lost in a sea of trivial updates, and misinformation was spreading like wildfire. This chaos was causing confusion and conflict among the inhabitants of FeedLand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Determined to restore balance, Ada embarked on a quest to find the Core Source, the mythical origin of all Feeds in FeedLand. She believed that by reaching the Core Source, she could rectify the disturbances and bring order back to the information flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ada's adventure took her through diverse territories. In the News Mountains, she navigated through towering peaks of breaking stories and deep valleys of in-depth analyses. In the Blog Plains, she encountered a wide array of opinions and narratives, learning to discern the insightful from the mundane. The Podcast Peninsula challenged her with a cacophony of voices and perspectives, each vying for attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Along her journey, Ada was accompanied by a group of companions, each representing different aspects of FeedLand's information ecosystem. There was Lex, a fact-checker with the uncanny ability to spot inaccuracies in seconds; Echo, a podcaster who could weave stories that captivated anyone who listened; and Pixel, a visual artist who could bring any information to life through graphics and animations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Together, they faced challenges like the Trolls of Misinformation, the Echo Chambers where no new thoughts could penetrate, and the Filter Bubbles that isolated communities from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they reached the Core Source, a vast, glowing nexus of data and information. Ada realized that the Core Source had become overwhelmed with the sheer volume and variety of information being generated. She used her unique ability to untangle the flows, filter out the noise, and establish new, more efficient pathways for information dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Feeds of FeedLand became clearer, more accurate, and more accessible to its inhabitants. Knowledge and news flowed harmoniously, enriching the lives of all who lived there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ada's journey taught her the importance of critical thinking, discernment, and the responsible sharing of information. She continued to explore the ever-evolving landscape of FeedLand, always ensuring that the streams of information remained pure and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her story became a legend in FeedLand, inspiring others to be mindful of the information they consumed and shared, making Ada a symbol of wisdom and guidance in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/23/adaTheYoungHeroOfFeedland.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Ada, the young hero of FeedLand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What I've learned about WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; this morning, APIs and feeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;This last year I’ve caught up with WordPress, have been asking questions, and one of the best thing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/12.html#a142810&quot;&gt;my work with Automattic&lt;/a&gt; is that the doors have been open. I have great teachers who are encouraging me, and of course are experts in and proud of WordPress, and as a result I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; are going to work together in some very nice ways. Getting pretty close on some of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A year ago I didn’t even know that WordPress still had APIs. At some point the code I had that worked with WordPress via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; broke, and I assumed that it was the end of the line, and took the feature out of my linkblogging tool. But I was wrong. And not only that there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/&quot;&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, a modern REST interface, that works in the same model I use for FeedLand and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s all there. I love it. All kinds of integrations will be possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Getting FeedLand to work in the new environment has been a step by step process. It was built to run on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; server, with a file system. I’ve converted now all the pieces we needed, and it seems finally to run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Onward! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT was overloaded earlier this evening. I wrote: &quot;I'm losing my shit here. I feel as lost without it as I would have felt last year without Google. Anyway here's the question I need answered. 'working in javascript in the browser, a question about using localstorage. are there any rules about how much storage you can use? would 10MB be too much? 50MB?'&quot; Believe it or not my friend ChatGPT will have some advice about that and it'll be pretty good. You can't find that through a search engine, btw, which is why OpenAI is so important.</description>

			<description>There's a flaw in the design of our social networks. The idea that there are &quot;conversations&quot; when actually many of the replies you get are spam. People trying to attach their name to something that they hope gets them attention and followers. So when someone addresses something to you it can be confusing, because they aren't actually talking to you, they're talking to the imagined thousands of people over your shoulder looking for some new tweeter or tooter or threader to adore. When it's actually mostly people looking for places to hang their own spam to catch other people's attention and followers. Is there anything actually going on there? Sadly, no.</description>

But we limit the vertical space a feed item gets in the timeline, you can see the whole thing by clicking on it, and clicking again after having a look. If you want to create a genuine art feed, then I want to make it look great in FeedLand. And keep the more rude feeds manageable. If you're playing around with artcasting, let me know, I'd like to see how others are doing, and share interesting stuff with people who follow this feed.</description>

But it's the thought that counts. ❤️ &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A creative diagram representing a technology stack as a building with multiple floors. At the bottom floor, label it 'TCP'. The next floor above should be labeled 'HTTP'. Above that, have a larger floor labeled 'RSS', with smaller adjacent floors labeled 'Atom' and 'ActivityPub'. The top two floors should be labeled 'Textcasting' and 'Artcasting' respectively. Surrounding the building, depict human-style animals like dogs, bears, owls, and hamsters, all dressed in business attire. Each of these characters should be holding signs with the names of tech companies like Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Salesforce.com. The diagram should illustrate the hierarchy and importance of each technology layer in the stack, with a whimsical and engaging representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Hundreds of people filled out the form, though. I think we really messed something up in the follow-up, including not making it self-serve to start. Will review and try again. It's an important promise to us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm very much a customer for this service. It would be worth $10K for to buy 100 years of persistence for my web writing. A simple easy to understand service that helps get the process started. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I transfer &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; to Automattic as registrar. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I upload the contents from S3 to Automattic server. Static files, HTML, feeds, images, code. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Automattic provides an API to keep the files updated and so I can add to them as long as I'm still writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The files are publicly accessible over HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Automattic agrees to renew the domain for 100 years, and manage access to the files, with reasonable limits and acts of god accounted for, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I pay you $10K on signing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why should you do it -- simple, easy benefit, i think you'd sell a lot of contracts, and you could start the business now, and get started serving customers and learning what they want, how they work, and get ideas for where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, I read in a news article the other day that I developed iPodder, the first podcasting client in 2004. This is not true. The first podcasting client was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. I did not write &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_(aggregator)&quot;&gt;iPodder&lt;/a&gt;, it was a community effort.</description>

I'm not trying to change Jeff's mind, but just to say I think my friend got this one wrong." created="Sun, 19 Nov 2023 13:47:06 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/19/gutenberg.png" imageLink="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/gutenberg-parenthesis-9781501394829/" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/19.html#a134706"/>

			<description>The first miracle of the web was that people could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; and share knowledge. This was thought to have been a failure as journalism focused on abusive social media systems. But that's where the second miracle, AI, got all its info from. I guess something worked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Also it turns out a number of established feed readers already do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278&quot;&gt;right thing&lt;/a&gt; with image enclosures. So that nails it, this is the way to do it. Support in FeedLand will be added shortly.</description>

Photographs. Paintings. News. The consensus seems to be that we should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt; element, as with podcasting. In this case, if the type begins with &quot;image/&quot; then an &lt;i&gt;artcast&lt;/i&gt; viewer should handle it, and others should ignore it. We were at this place with podcasting in 2001, and needed some examples, so we had a feed of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead music&lt;/a&gt; to start using the technology. Here's the artcasting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/artfeed.xml&quot;&gt;test feed&lt;/a&gt;. Try subscribing to it in a feed reader you like. Hopefully it either ignores the enclosure or it does the right thing with it, displays it. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for comments, questions and screen shots.</description>

			<description>I think a basic hookup to a chatbot is going to become part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec pretty quickly. So far the best one I've seen is Guy Kawasaki's. I want to be able to ask for a list of things I've written on a given topic, and to be able to ask the questions in the same straightforward way I ask ChatGPT.</description>

			<description>BTW, Bluesky has excellent RSS 2.0 support. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky. You can hook that up to any feed reader, obviously. But think about it, this is something new.</description>
