			<description>Journalism is very important part of how our country works yet there is no accountability, no checks and balances, no requirement of transparency. There isn’t even a mechanism to disagree with them. most of the time they have the only voice. We don’t even know what they’re trying to do, what their goals are.</description>

We've had to live with journalism that tries to give lies equal stature to actual news, but the two just don't mix. What happens if your news is half lies, the users don't believe &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; you carry. This was predicted, in 2016 when it was clear that Putin's Russia was heavily influencing American journalism. They had developed their techniques in Ukraine in previous years, and the Ukraine press and government came to the same conclusion we're now arriving at -- stop at the first lie, turn the microphone off. That's the main rule, main change that has to take place now, in advance of the November election. They may not do it, but at least now we all understand that what they're doing is stupid, wrong, even corrupt. No matter what they don't get to keep their rep if they are laundering lies.</description>

Heard it just now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/articles/the-makeorbreak-issues-of-the-2024-election&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; after a Republican was using &quot;talking points&quot; that were &quot;misleading.&quot; Of course lies &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; misleading, but they are also lies. What these reporters hope to do (I guess) is convince you that the lies they just broadcast don't reflect poorly on them. If they said &quot;that guy just lied five times&quot; you'd have to wonder why they included it. What's wrong with them. But if they just were &quot;misleading&quot; oh I guess that's okay. Same thing happened in an otherwise pretty honorable piece by Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post. &quot;When not one but multiple rants call 'into question not only his fitness for office but his basic cognitive abilities,' the media’s refusal to convey Trump’s unfitness amounts to misleading the public.&quot; No. It's not just misleading, it's deadly -- to the reputation of the publication that didn't convey what they saw clearly with their own two eyes. The rest of the Rubin piece is worth reading. I expect she softened her criticism because she has to work with the editors at the Post who decided to keep cutting Trump slack. You and I don't have that problem. The news industry in the US must be scrapped and replaced with one that tells the truth, otherwise what's the point.</description>

GitHub has a better model for text with comments, supports full Markdown the way it was meant to work. I have an instance of Masto that I can use that supports Markdown but they do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/16/thisIsNotALegitWayToDisplayALink.png&quot;&gt;unacceptable&lt;/a&gt; rendering of links. &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.masto.land/@dave/112971999302900967&quot;&gt;Example post&lt;/a&gt;. I want a simple, widely accepted easy place to comment, on the social web, not Discourse or GitHub, that isn't controlled by one vendor (so ActivityPub for now is probably the best approach) and supports plain old Markdown without any weird embellishments. I don't work in the Mastodon world, I'm already committed to the projects I'm doing. But we could really use something nice, designed to plug into blogs. This is a good use-case, and it's pretty close.</description>

			<description>I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt; and it caught on, and has been used by a few open source projects. I hope that the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/newRulesForJournalists/&quot;&gt;rules for journalism&lt;/a&gt;, which is just getting started, will be similarly influential. If existing journalism is going to start working again, they're going to have to have some rules.

			<description>August 15, 2004: My &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/08/15/augustCoffeeNotes.html&quot;&gt;audio blog post&lt;/a&gt; from NYC, from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Podcast0 feed&lt;/a&gt;. Had just listened to an Adam Curry podcast and one from the Gillmor Gang. Played a bit of music, described how a podcatcher would work, pretty close to the way they work today. Shortly after the feature would be in Radio UserLand. It was the only episode I did in August 2004. The next one is on September 1 and there are a total of nine shows in September, including the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt; which is a podcast Adam and I did together. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/08.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for this blog in August 2004.</description>

			<description>The best journalism is coming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq&quot;&gt;from the candidate&lt;/a&gt;. I think you could make a pretty good hour-length show on MSNBC with 12 of their posts, five minutes each, one after the other, with a small panel of pundits quickly snarking about what they just saw. Go have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq&quot;&gt;the feed&lt;/a&gt; and see if you agree. The best thing about it is that the writing is totally blogger-style.</description>

In the next few months Twitter is going to morph into the political system that Barack Obama could have and should have built.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turns out creating a president of the United States is worth a lot of money. Trump is inept at squeezing the money out of it, he's a loudmouth who proved one thing, Twitter is all you needed in 2016 to get elected president. That's going to change, as competition shows up (Zuckerberg, for example, with Threads). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They know, even if you don't -- that it can be very profitable to own the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Trump loses, Musk won't get it on this round, but eventually he will own a big piece of the president, and then he will move his deals with SpaceX and Tesla up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, it's only 11 minutes.

			<title>Harris makes me proud</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this campaign. Latest innovation, they're going to do at least one public rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration, and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don't want to witness is what the journalists try to provoke. I've been to two DNCs and later heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented crises that simply didn't exist. Who's going to have time to call them out because no one at the convention is watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard on a podcast yesterday that it's weird that Harris is polling as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important&quot;&gt;generic&lt;/a&gt; Democrat, which they felt was odd because she's not a white man, which made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party. Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not interracial and female.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the United States. We're strong, and we win, and when we don't we get back up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we've yet to create the interracial and female version that symbol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it doesn't have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our political system its flirtation with fascism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/14/ladyLibertyFullSizeIowa.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Statue of Liberty in the heartland. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ezra Klein and Nate Silver</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had another morning of driving around so I listened to a bunch of podcasts about how the campaign is going, all good news for Democrats which of course makes me happy. The last podcast I listened to was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nate-silver.html&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein's interview with Nate Silver&lt;/a&gt;. I only listened to the first 20 minutes because I ran out of time. I may pick it up later on my afternoon walk (it's a gorgeous day in the mountains). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/13/trafficUptight.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;They talked about their bond as old school bloggers. I didn't know either of them when they were starting out, which is kind of sad -- most of the bloggers I heard from in that period were mad at me the way they are mad at Elon Musk now. Both Silver and Klein campaigned for Biden to step aside, which I felt it was inappropriate -- for Silver who was/is a trusted polling analyst, and Klein who is a columnist for the NYT. I had already listened to Klein's interview with Nancy Pelosi. But I really don't like that both of them crossed a line I felt they had no business crossing, becoming an advocate rather than a journalist. I can't thikn about either of them without thinking about that. But I listened anyway, because I'm interested in both, and esp the combination. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The discussion was interesting and even agreeable until Klein asked Silver about his relationship with Peter Thiel. I had read that Silver was connected to Thiel in some way. Before they moved on neither commented on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape&quot;&gt;Thiel's funding&lt;/a&gt; of the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that destroyed Gawker. I don't know how they can both, for their careers, which depend on free speech, still have a kind word for Thiel. I never liked Gawker, they made fun of me, and others, in horrific ways, that weren't even based on facts, the kind of bullshit pre-teens make up about people when they can't think of anything else to say. Even though they hurt me, embarrassed me, aroused my hate, even if I had the kind of money Thiel has, I never in a million years would use that money to destroy them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thiel's wealth is a weapon aimed at all our freedom. This is something imho that has to at least be &lt;i&gt;mentioned&lt;/i&gt; when a journalist talks about Thiel, and neither of them did. I guess they feel safe from Thiel's attacks, perhaps because they have adjusted their writing so as to never risk offending him, which totally undermines their integrity, if so. A good way to prove that's not true would be to never mention him without saying his behavior the Hulk Hogan vs Gawker was reprehensible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still listened, even though they provoked my ire in a very fundamental way. I'd be interested in hearing from them, as a fellow old school blogger, if they justify Thiel's funding of the Hogan lawsuit and if so, how. But I expect that both of them consider themselves in an elite class and wouldn't deign to explain themselves, or the truth is something they don't want disclosed. Either way, to be blogger-blunt, they both suck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: I listened to more of the interview. I think these guys need to get out more. The reason Harris is having such a strong response is that we the voters are desperate to not have another term for Trump. We understand the stakes in the election. You always try to reduce it to numbers, when the facts are available at a more human level. The reason we love Kamala is born of desperation. Stop talking to each other, you already know why we care, because underneath it all &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; care because you're human and you come from America too. And btw about VCs, I know a lot about them, I'm assuming at some point Klein will leave the NYT to make millions with Thiel, and I imagine Silver is already doing that, but you both have the disease. You assume great money makes people interesting. It can make them dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A new rule for journalists. End the interview on the first egregious lie. Turn the lights out, switch off the recorder, get up and leave. And your report should state clearly that this is why the interview was terminated. It never should have been tolerated in the first place.</description>

			<description>I listened to a bunch of podcasts this morning about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/184754/donald-trump-freaked-out-harris-walz-attacks&quot;&gt;freaked out Trump&lt;/a&gt; is. If a president freaks out over something like this, how would he handle a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis&quot;&gt;Cuban Missile Crisis&lt;/a&gt;? Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg&quot;&gt;phone call&lt;/a&gt; at 3AM? We saw what he did with COVID, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/politics/kamala-harris-speech/index.html&quot;&gt;froze&lt;/a&gt;, like he's freezing now.</description>

			<description>When Google tells you it's easy to convert a site to HTTPS they're wrong. It's an insurmountable job for scripting.com. 30 years of writing is on that domain, lots of different runtimes on lots of different domains which would also have to be converted. Images in all the pages. All that breaks when you flip the switch. I can't walk away from a big part of my life's work. Sorry, not for Google. Every time someone assumes I'm to blame for this situation, that's how Google has tricked you. I followed the rules. They broke them.</description>

			<description>Idea for a neat product from Automattic or really anyone: Configure WordPress for writing a book, hook it up to an AI service that can always turn that site into prose, reorganized into chapters, however you'd like, on demand, in an instant. You could use an outliner to arrange the table of contents and it could automatically generate a back of the book index. Technologically I think today's AI is ready to do this, just needs to be packaged. Charge a fair price for the service, esp at the beginning it would totally be worth it. Who knows where it would lead. I bet a lot of writers would use it, I certainly would.</description>

The latter is my main phone, and I prefer it to the Apple phone, not sure why, it's what I use for most things. I need the iPhone because I use an Apple Watch. Lately there's been some trouble with the screen on the Pixel 6, on certain gestures, the right edge lights up in bright green and then immediately returns to normal. I'm thinking the display may be about to fail? It might be time for a new phone. So I went to the Pixel site to see what they have that's new and found that they're announcing a new phone, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/ac8f1461-9923-43da-87b9-b951ff2f32b2&quot;&gt;Pixel 9&lt;/a&gt;, on Tuesday. So I immediately, of course, dropped the idea of buying an upgrade today, why not wait till the new version is out. I looked over the teaser, guessing that AI figures big in this release. Not sure how I feel about that because the last thing I want to do is switch over to Google's AI from my beloved ChatGPT. Kind of the same thing I see happening with Threads re Twitter.</description>

Some people will be surprised to find that they're in the archive. If this works it'll be like the index in the back of a large book. I know I've tried this before, but this time I think I'll be able to do it myself and fuss over it and learn from it the way I do software development. Converting a very large work of writing into a reference, I hope.</description>
