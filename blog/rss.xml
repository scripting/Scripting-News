			<description>Summarizing the last 18 years on the web. Between Twitter and Google Reader, the web was cut into two, and they didn't get along. We may now be on the cusp of fixing that. Why? Because WordPress and Mastodon work with each other in unforeseen ways. We got lucky, because I don't think this was done consciously by the developers of either product.</description>

			<title>The web lives in WordPress and Mastodon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a morning ritual which begins with breakfast and iced coffee, and my laptop, on the kitchen table, to review the news, sports, whatever. Write a few tweets or share a few links. Usually with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/&quot;&gt;WNYC&lt;/a&gt; playing in the background until I find something I want to read carefully, then I shout at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexa.com/&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; to go away. When done, I head upstairs where the work begins, often with a blog post, as I'm writing now, and sometimes with a bit of code, but that usually waits until my brain is warmed up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But today I had a different assignment. Instead of tweeting, I wrote a few wordpress/mastodon posts, a new hybrid, a medium that I may well be the first person to explore, to do actual writing in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/11/kong.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I have a writing tool I call wordLand, it connects directly to WordPress, and from there, one of my sites is hooked up to Mastodon via ActivityPub. I choose to view it that way, to keep from going crazy. I know that it's hooked up to the &quot;fediverse&quot; -- meaning my writing can be viewed by any other app that supports the protocol Masotodon supports which is kind of ActivityPub+ -- where the + is the Mastodon API. Not sure what the ratios are, and I don't care. In this context I am a user, and happy to be that. The developers at Automattic are taking care of the technical details. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the conclusion that appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113288911901690601&quot;&gt;one of the posts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in my kitchen this morning -- &quot;I am more excited about the web than I have been in a &lt;i&gt;lonnnnng&lt;/i&gt; time.&quot; I am. I explained why in one of my posts, but it comes down to this. I have most of the features I asked for in &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; (!) and I am typing in a respectable editing window, where I retain copies of my writing, and there's no freaking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt;. And because I'm hooking in through a protocol (here's the punchline) this writing can go anywhere. Anywhere. Let me say that again. Any. Where. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like I said the other day, I doubt if Automattic knows what they have. I seriously doubt it. But in a few years, we're going to look back on this as the moment when Twitter stopped controlling our writing, as they have since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No more character limits. Posts can have titles, or not. We can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/scripting/manila/bloggerCon/ruleoflinks.html&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;, as many as we like. Styling works. We can edit our posts. And the really big payoff, I can use a writing tool I love and you can use a tool you love and they work together perfectly well. And if one day you feel like using mine, and I feel like using yours, it just works. So in one step, we turn the clock back to 1994, when the web had all the features a writer could want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Links to the stories I wrote earlier, on Mastodon:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113288911901690601&quot;&gt;My new writing environment does textcasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113288829308266525&quot;&gt;I have bad luck hooking up to platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113288799924700948&quot;&gt;A place for a 90s blogosperic reboot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress versions are linked to from the Mastodon posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Enter this in the address box: &lt;b&gt;@daveverse.wordpress.com&lt;/b&gt; to follow this blog in Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The series is over, the next game on Sunday will be against the winner in the west, either San Diego or Los Angeles. Last night's game was stressful, low scoring, until the Mets star shortstop hit a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/video/francisco-lindor-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-center-field-starling-marte-score&quot;&gt;freaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;grand slam&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/francisco-lindor-sends-mets-to-the-nlcs-eliminates-phillies-with-grand-slam-in-nlds-game-4-035006801.html&quot;&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;, and that was all the scoring we needed. The Mets are the hottest team in baseball. It doesn't feel like a long time since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; when they got to the World Series before crashing. Who knows how far we'll get this year, honestly -- I'm surprised (and pleased) we got this far. And in the meantime, I caught a tiny bit of last night's preseason game between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bulletsforever.com/2024/10/9/24266653/washington-wizards-new-york-knicks-nba-preseason-game-recap&quot;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt; and some other team I don't care about. They have two new stars to add to the roster after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/isaiah-hartenstein-2024-free-agency&quot;&gt;losing one star&lt;/a&gt; as a free agent, and trading two others for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/karl-anthony-towns-trade-knicks-timberwolves&quot;&gt;second new star&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, very enticing. New York has some excellent sports teams, which is unusual, because it isn't just the Jankees this time, a team I will, I promise, &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; root for. Quite the opposite. I will root for whoever they are playing. You can probably tell I don't like them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Memorable TV-watching moments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/natalia_barbour/status/1806331423814484272&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that says something that's obviously true until you realize it's not. &quot;No kid remembers their best day in front of the TV.&quot; In fact I have four memories from my youth, watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I remember my father rolling around on the floor when the ball went through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18caPNisP2U&quot;&gt;Buckner's legs&lt;/a&gt;. My father &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; rolled around on the floor, before or since. But I liked seeing him let go just that once. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another with my father. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenWdylTtzs&quot;&gt;Beatles were on Ed Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; he said they were wearing wigs. He knew that because no man would actually have hair like that. I was 8 or 9 years old and remember telling him I didn't think he got that right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I remember exactly where I was when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwZb2mqId0A&quot;&gt;Neil Armstrong walked on the moon&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Folk_Festival&quot;&gt;Newport Folk Festival&lt;/a&gt; and about 500 people were watching a tiny TV on top of a VW bus.

			<description>After Katrina I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12.html&quot;&gt;went to New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; to see what was left, esp in the areas where there was a 15-25 foot storm surge in coastal Mississippi. If you went inland from the coast for a few miles there was nothing left. No trees, only a few skeletal all-concrete buildings where the beach used to be, otherwise &lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/73989089/in/album-1588659&quot;&gt;everything destroyed&lt;/a&gt;. What you don't necessarily realize that it isn't just 15 feet of water, it's 15 feet of stormy ocean with cars and building debris being pushed around floating in the water. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DA5zrXQJVYE&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on Threads provides a visual illustration of what a 9 foot surge is like.</description>

My friends at Automattic showed me how to turn on ActivityPub on a WordPress site. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2024/10/08/writers-come-first-in-wordland/&quot;&gt;test post&lt;/a&gt; in my simple WordPress editor, forgetting that it would be cross-posted to Mastodon. When I just checked in on Masto, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113272969462140490&quot;&gt;there was the freaking post&lt;/a&gt;. After I recovered from passing out, I wondered what happens if I update the post in my editor, and save it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2024/10/08/writers-come-first-in-wordland/&quot;&gt;WordPress site&lt;/a&gt; that's hooked up to Masto via ActivityPub. So I made a change and saved it. I waited and waited, nothing happened. I got ready to add a comment saying ahh I guess it doesn't update, when -- it updated. Oh geez look at that. Folks, I did nothing here but write an app that can be used to edit WordPress posts. And I got in return an app that is part of the freaking Fediverse. And I never had to write a line of ActivityPub code. Think about that. I don't know if Automattic understands what they have, honestly.</description>

			<title>Guy Kawasaki, proto-evangelist</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/20/brilliantFriend.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; and I have been going back and forth privately about what we want from our personal ChatGPT. Here's one thing for the list. When I go to Google and search for NBB, it should take me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. It shouldn't even require me to click on Feelin Lucky. Google has had 26 years to get to know me, and it still thinks I might mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbbank.com/&quot;&gt;National Bank of Blacksburg&lt;/a&gt;. Folks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my blog, read it and use it as context when I ask a question. And they don't have to even read my blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB&lt;/a&gt; is defined in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt;, which I make public and is used in rendering all my pages. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A few years back, Google, when I searched for my mother, using her correctly-spelled last name, which happened to also be &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; last name, showed me results for Eve Wilmer.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to Guy. I asked if he's written about what an evangelist is. To me, he is the prototypical evangelist. He's #1 and there isn't a #2 or #3. He has written about it, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/05/the-art-of-evangelism&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. But his story is, excuse me, bullshit. I should record a podcast about what an evangelist is, as I was very well-schooled in this by Guy. Let me try here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The evangelist for a product or organization is the person who deliberately tilts the playing field in favor of developer products that absolutely must get out there for the organization to achieve its mission. How is the tilt determined? Intuitively. If some random schmuck approaches him out of the blue at a developer conference, and explains their problem, where most BigCo people ignore them, the evangelist listens carefully. Helps without a second thought. And his door is open, if the developer wants to follow up. He helps route his needs through the organization. No developer is on their own if Guy is there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when the killer product comes along, the one that will give Mac users something to get charged up over in 1986 when the hardware problems were being solved (they were!) and the software flow had dried up, Guy gets the developer the $400K they need to keep the doors open to ship the freaking product. The level playing field approach, which most tech companies follow, results in dead developers and platforms whose capabilities go unexplored. Users get bored, and move on to where the excitement is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen products and companies fail to look around them to see what's possible. They only look inward at their own organizations who fail year after year to create products that users love. There's a reason for this, but you don't need to know it -- you just need to keep looking at every possible victory and when one comes along, do anything it takes to get it out to users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've applied Guy's teaching in every project I've done since I got to know him in 1983 and when we, together, rode the wave of success in the Mac in 1986.

				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; and I have been going back and forth privately about what we want from our personal ChatGPT. Here's one thing for the list. When I go to Google and search for NBB, it should take me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. It shouldn't even require me to click on Feelin Lucky. Google has had 26 years to get to know me, and it still thinks I might mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbbank.com/&quot;&gt;National Bank of Blacksburg&lt;/a&gt;. Folks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my blog, read it and use it as context when I ask a question. And they don't have to even read my blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB&lt;/a&gt; is defined in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt;, which I make public and is used in rendering all my pages." created="Tue, 08 Oct 2024 15:42:42 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/20/brilliantFriend.png" collapse="true" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/08/155702.html#a154242">

				<source:outline text="Back to Guy. I asked if he's written about what an evangelist is. To me, he is the prototypical evangelist. He's #1 and there isn't a #2 or #3. He has written about it, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/05/the-art-of-evangelism&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. But his story is, excuse me, bullshit. I should record a podcast about what an evangelist is, as I was very well-schooled in this by Guy.

				<source:outline text="The evangelist for a product or organization is the person who deliberately tilts the playing field in favor of developer products that absolutely must get out there for the organization to achieve its mission. How is the tilt determined? Intuitively. If some random schmuck approaches him out of the blue at a developer conference, and explains their problem, where most BigCo people ignore them, the evangelist listens carefully. Helps without a second thought. And his door is open, if the developer wants to follow up. He helps route his needs through the organization. No developer is on their own if Guy is there." created="Tue, 08 Oct 2024 16:14:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/08/155702.html#a161451"/>
				<source:outline text="And when the killer product comes along, the one that will give Mac users something to get charged up over in 1986 when the hardware problems were being solved (they were!) and the software flow had dried up, Guy gets the developer the $400K they need to keep the doors open to ship the freaking product. The level playing field approach, which most tech companies follow, results in dead developers and platforms whose capabilities go unexplored. Users get bored, and move on to where the excitement is." created="Tue, 08 Oct 2024 16:16:44 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/08/155702.html#a161644"/>
				<source:outline text="I've seen products and companies fail to look around them to see what's possible. They only look inward at their own organizations who fail year after year to create products that users love. There's a reason for this, but you don't need to know it -- you just need to keep looking at every possible victory and when one comes along, do anything it takes to get it out to users." created="Tue, 08 Oct 2024 16:26:04 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/08/155702.html#a162604"/>

I stand by what I wrote then, but I'd add this. My blog started because I needed content to test a script I had written that sent emails on my Mac using &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt;, which was an early &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html&quot;&gt;scriptable app&lt;/a&gt; and I had a nice scripting system that worked with it. I looked around for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/07/marccantersingsagain.html&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; to send (30 years ago today), and shot out an email to the people whose business cards I had collected at various tech conferences. It was a thrill, so I did it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/12/marcs10things.html&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/13/lettertocannavino.html&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/14/howtoinvestinpdas.html&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/16/randybattatonpdas.html&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/17/pdasonparade.html&quot;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;, before I realized hey I could use this thing to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;my own ideas&lt;/a&gt; out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. And thus began &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this thing&lt;/a&gt; that I still do to this day. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/06/142657.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about WordPress in the last few days. There may be hope to find a blogosphere buried somewhere in there. And it may be possible to give them some sweet new writing tools so they can get excited about writing on the web the way we did all those years ago. I actually am kind of optimistic about that. Maybe we can stand up something in the midst of the noise. When we booted up podcasting, approx 20 years ago, we had a slogan -- &quot;Users and developers party together.&quot; It worked! That is still the way I want to build stuff, it's the only way I know how to do it. Blogging started out as a programming adventure and eventually became a form of literature. How about that. I'm up for doing more of that if you all are. But please expect to make contributions, don't expect it all to come to you for free, because as we know nothing really is free.</description>

Thanks to John Naughton's wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the Guardian, I'm hearing from people all over the world about what blogging means to them. I appreciate all of the messages, but would appreciate them &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; if they were on your blog. We need to keep using the tech. Blogging is kind of lost, and I would like to see that change. Every time you post something you're proud of on a social media site, how about taking a moment and posting it to your blog too. And while there, if appropriate, link to something from some part of your post, even though the social media sites don't support linking, the web is still there and it still does.</description>

			<description>Interestingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/07/mailClock.png&quot;&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the nightly emails does not agree with the clock on the home page of Scripting News. It's a hard thing to test in real life. And it's completely fitting, given the motto of the blog is: &lt;i&gt;it's even worse than it appears,&lt;/i&gt; which could be the motto of all programmers everywhere, and probably bloggers too. We always focus on the bad news, of course -- that's human nature -- but always remember, it could actually be worse.</description>

			<title>Pseudo code and kitchen-table conversations</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/07/pseudoCodeAndKitchenTableConversations.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; has nothing to do with the 30 year milestone, except that it is totally unscripted, stream of consciousness, for 30 minutes, on two topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The idea of what a programming language is, is about to be completely overturned. The verbs and nouns will, at least at first, be pretty much exactly like we do it now, but the way you specify how they work, how they interact both in the UI and on the backend, will be done more or less as you would document the user interface. The AI system is almost ready to work at that level. With a few more iterations by human designers it should all meet up in a place where the slogging type work I've been doing for 50+ years will be obsolete. We will all become anachronisms. All of us. Get ready for it. And btw I was the biggest skeptic of the idea of a higher level more human way of programming. Scoffed at the idea. Repeatedly. Never say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The second part is about kitchen-table conversations in families, the bored rantings of our ancestors, passed on lovingly from generation to generation. Should have realized that we did not turn a racial corner with the election of Obama, we all should have gotten prepared for the backlash from children of the slavers and fascists, who were raised alongside us as victims of slavery and fascism were raised to feel persecuted. We all revert to our comfortable roles. The question is can we rise above that and forget for a moment what our ancestors taught us as gospel and take an interest in going beyond that, or do we have to do another loop around the genocide and its consequences, which this time will be &lt;i&gt;far worse&lt;/i&gt; than they were in the 1940s because of all the new war and computer tech and the damage done by the post-war growth. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel good about this podcast, because it has nothing to do with the milestone. I have an idea of what it feels like to have been blogging for 30 years, but no conclusions to offer that would mean anything to me or anyone else, except perhaps a psychologist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been watching a lot of sports recently and the interviews with star athletes saying the same predictable bullshit after being asked how it felt to do whatever heroic thing they just did. All of TV and news is like that, none of it is news, all of it is predictable bullshit. That is probably why they have so much trouble reporting the truth about Trump and Musk. It doesn't fit into their job description, it's not in anyone's job to tell the truth. And &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>WordPress destiny, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Glad I wrote the piece I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html?title=wordPressDestiny1&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could have written it any time in the last year as I was investigating and developing on the WordPress API and back end, but now seemed to be a good time, with all the attention its getting, and Matt's interviews, I and others are getting a better idea of what the various components of the community are. I don't know about the rest of you, but I had only a vague idea of what WordPress is beyond a piece of software used for commerce and to a lesser extent these days, writing on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few ideas -- not in any particular order:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;From my point of view, blogging and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress is being built &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; more than being built on, when it is such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;potent&lt;/a&gt; and surprisingly open &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt;. I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is a strong foundation that you could build &lt;i&gt;any kind of writing software&lt;/i&gt; on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we'd be compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; are amazing. I don't say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The company desperately needs an evangelism function.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one (which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the Facebook platform, btw -- and from a software design perspective it's brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpidentity&lt;/a&gt; package I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election Facebook's API was radically restricted, not something many people know about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn't appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory their server could be cloned (it's open source) but it certainly could be emulated at an API level. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's enticing. All those users -- there should be a market for writing tools there, but there isn't. Why is that??&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I feel like we're like ships passing in the night. I thought I should point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction I don't understand and don't see why I should want to. Did they care when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original blogosphere? I don't see any evidence of it. It's like Walmart sought to build a shopping center on the remains of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria&quot;&gt;Library of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;. People don't seem to have any respect for independent writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and &lt;i&gt;the dream was realized.&lt;/i&gt; No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And no wonder journalism doesn't defend it, they are offended by the idea of people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we do. We're their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer&quot;&gt;John Naughton's piece&lt;/a&gt; today in the Guardian. He's doing more to focus attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge, something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn't have to wait for Matt to turn in that direction. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some thoughts as the world seems to be converging on something, not sure what. There are so many doors that are now open that never were before, the question is -- do we have the courage to connect the dots and work together, or do we all insist on going our own ways to a fairly dark future.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you're a developer, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; you use in browser-JS code for the wpidentity package. This was the way Facebook packaged their API for developers, and it was far more efficient than the way Twitter did and WordPress too. So I added this to the stack, and built on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How about those Mets, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of 2015, when the Mets were so charmed -- they could be down 9-0 in the 8th inning and you would tune into the game to see how they'd win it. It's not the usual thing for the Mets, who pull defeat from the jaws of victory far more often than the other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And omg, 2024 is shaping up the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sit down and shut up, here come the Mets!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, because I have stuff to do -- the Mets were down 1-0 in the bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks like it's going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time down and to the right. You could try to swing but you'd have to be very lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they took out Wheeler (pitchers don't do complete games any longer, they used to). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Mets were ready. Hit after hit after hit and before you knew it, it was 5-1. Alonso, the star of the last Milwaukee game drove in one of the runs with a long sacrifice fly to center.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Phillies and their fans who had been so confident of victory were shocked. And left to plan for today's game at 4PM on Fox. You gotta know where I'll be -- glued to the set and dreaming about the fate of this Mets team who shows real signs of strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=mets+philosophy+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>WordPress has a greater destiny</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years before WordPress came out, I did a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22radio+userland%22&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; which was a combination &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/024232.html?title=radioUserlandScreenShot&quot;&gt;blogging tool&lt;/a&gt; and feed reader. Two main screens, a streamlined UI. You could get in quickly, write and publish a post in a minute, and see it show up in the reader a moment later. It worked, and it added a major new component to the blogging world, and I think still represents the simplest most focused UI for writing. It was a really popular product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same idea, really simple blog post writing and editing, with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; that should be available to web writers, optional titles, links, simple styling, enclosures, the ability to edit. The things the common social web apps generally &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This imho is a huge opportunity. I wish this is where the focus in the WordPress community was, but I think right now the world is building &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; WordPress, not on it. It could be great, it could totally solve the problem of a new document standard in the social web that makes it really like the web. Instead they're fighting over who owns what part of the WordPress trademark, at least as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Last year I created a Node.js package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpidentity&lt;/a&gt; that acts as a bridge between a browser-based JavaScript app and the WordPress back-end, and the result is fine. It suggests that there could be a developer community writing apps that all join up in the middle in WordPress's database. Pretty powerful idea! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I think the users, the writers, would love it, because we developers could &lt;b&gt;compete to delight them&lt;/b&gt;, and not have to worry about building a huge server capability as Automattic already has debugged and scaled. And maybe the battle that's going on now could fade into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's not clear what intelligence in humans is or how it works. We just believe it exists. So then the question is, can machines do the same thing? The truth is no one knows. It could be that human intelligence, once we figure out what it is, will be as trivial as they tell us the AI &quot;intelligence&quot; is.

			<source:outline text="I think a lot of confusion about AI products comes from the name. It's not clear what intelligence in humans is or how it works. We just believe it exists. So then the question is, can machines do the same thing? The truth is no one knows. It could be that human intelligence, once we figure out what it is, will be as trivial as they tell us the AI &quot;intelligence&quot; is. So if you're trying to make sense of it, or if the idea is offensive, try pretending that &quot;intelligence&quot; was &quot;pomegranate&quot; or &quot;cauliflower&quot; -- these are two terms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKoFCUaUbY&quot;&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; suggested George Harrison use in place of words in &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/The-beatles-something-lyrics&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; he hasn't come up with.

			<title>How about those Mets!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/04/caseyStengelMetsManager.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;We are a Mets family. Around the kitchen table in my childhood home, the default question was &quot;What did the Mets do?&quot; Before I was born we were a Brooklyn Dodgers family, always National League, but the Dodgers left shortly after I was born and the Mets came along when I was seven, and that was it for us. It was the one thing we all agreed on -- the Mets. Much later when my Mom and I would fight about something, a pretty regular thing -- I invented what I called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hello.typepad.com/hello/2009/11/shea-stadium-rules.html&quot;&gt;Shea Stadium Rules&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that a disagreement could be tabled when we remember that underneath everything we are true Mets fans, and ultimately Mets fans can find something to agree on -- that rain or shine and there was plenty of rain, we always stood with our team. A deeper truth of the Mets was we didn't really mind when they lost. Because underneath it all at a whole other level, the Mets have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that is strong. We are the Mets and that's all you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last night it wasn't lookin good. It was a winner-take-all game with the hated (for now) Milwaukee Brewers. We hated them because it looked like they were going to end the Mets season in the first round of the playoffs. I was getting ready to take off my Mets cap for the year, and put on my Knicks cap, when Lindor walked, then Nimmo singled, and with runners on first and third and one out, Pete Alonso comes to the plate. He's been cold all year. I hoped for a base hit or at least a long sacrifice fly to bring in the runner on third. I couldn't watch but forced myself to. And then &lt;b&gt;it happened&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We who have been joined at the heart to this team and have been through it all, have come to expect failure, but sometimes winning happens, as it did last night. A big swing. The bat connects. Oh please let it land anywhere but the glove of a Brewer, and then all of a sudden Alonso is jogging around the bases, and delirium takes over, in the living room of my mountain home and everywhere Mets fans were at that fateful hour. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We figured at that point they might as well just retire the side, but the Metsies, who Casey Stengel, the first manager asked &quot;Can't anyone play this stinkin game!&quot; -- brought in another run, which it turns out we didn't need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Brewers were overwhelmed. They tried to score in the bottom of the ninth but the Mets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; was too strong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like every baseball kid's fantasy -- the count is 3 and 2 ,the team's back is to the wall, up comes the slugger, the crowd is silent and then he hits it &lt;b&gt;out of the park&lt;/b&gt; and the team emerges victorious and the young person's fantasy saves the day. We've all been there, many times. Last night we got to live it, again, this time for real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now we go to Philadelphia to give them a proper dose of New York love. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Mets meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Game 1 of the NLDS begins tomorrow at 4PM. Good times will be had by all (except Philadelphia fans of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This wasn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/08/baseballCanTeachUsAboutLif.html#p9&quot;&gt;Mookie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/whole-new-ballgame/new-york-mets-1986-world-series&quot;&gt;game 6 &lt;/a&gt;of the 1986 World Series, but it was along those lines of improbability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I love that they give a realtime readout on screen of the probability of each team winning. At the top of the ninth, before all the michegas, the Mets had only a 6% chance of winning. I think every game should come with a graph over time of this stat. It would be an emotional map, much more interesting than the other stats.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>AI deflates the value of expertise</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I didn't read the WSJ story about the deflation of expertise, quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla&quot;&gt;Vinod Khosla&lt;/a&gt;, Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who I know from my time in California. He says AI leads to a deflation of expertise. I agree with him, AI absolutely deflates the value of expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It aggregates all of our knowledge in one place where it's easy to access, about anything you want to know. It answers questions that you can't get any other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think about it. That's not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that didn't have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without television, and I didn't use a computer until I was 18 or use the web until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has been stretched before and I'm well educated and in my work have explored frontiers of knowledge, even so -- this is the most mind-stretching experience I've ever had. Not kidding. And I'm not a VC or prone to overhyping tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I write in my portal, and it flows where ever I want it to.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem is the reading portals aren't open to allow this to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all want you to write in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trade Secrets Radio: &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting&quot;&gt;What is podcasting?&lt;/a&gt; This is the exact moment, 9/24/2004, that podcasting got its name and its definition. It's pretty short. We knew what we were doing. We loved what RSS did for news. Now we were doing the same for radio. Not just talking about it, but finally -- doing it. It worked, pretty freaking well. There's a podcast episode to go with it, coming out shortly.</description>

If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.</description>

			<description>I had a dream last night with many of my dead relatives present. We were at some kind of social event. My grandfather had a new wife or girlfriend, but he didn't recognize me, though he pretended to. My mother was far off in the distance taking pictures. I wonder what that means. Some of them &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; dead and gone. I had to remind myself of that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.) My subconscious has a clear idea of who they are/were, only it doesn't register that some of them are gone.</description>

			<title>Cross-posting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-posting is here now. I am not surprised &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/croissant-debuts-a-cross-posting-app-for-threads-bluesky-and-mastodon/&quot;&gt;Croissant&lt;/a&gt; is getting such a positive reception. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is where the fediverse will be defined imho, in the intersection between the competing social web services. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll know it's working when they feel they have to match each others' features because with cross-posting their difference in character limits, titles, styling, links etc will be much more visible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Activitypub is too much. Cross-posting is exactly right and here now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
