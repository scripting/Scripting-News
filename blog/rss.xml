I am pretty sure I know exactly what would get the ball rolling now, upgrading the web platform so users can buy their own storage and let software tools access it. So we can have all kinds of editors working on Markdown text, without the developer having to become a reseller of storage, and without limiting its use to people can figure out how to create an S3 bucket, and map a domain to it, etc. Dropbox came close to doing this about a decade ago, but backed out. This is why development is so centralized around big silos. I've been an independent developer on the web for over 30 years, and before that 15 years on desktop computers before that.

			<title>Humans have an exclusive on being human</title>

It's something that my Android phone does every so often, when I haven't said the magic word that activates it, even if I'm not in the same room as the device. It's a tiny bit funny, but a reminder that the microphone is always on, so I watch what I say when walking around the house, knowing that whatever I say is likely to end up in a database, to be used against me in a court of law. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't like that it was a voice of a British woman. It was not a friendly voice, perhaps intended to communicate intelligence, competence. An unwelcome intrusion into reality, but then it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; reality -- I'm getting old, and won't be here that much longer, and odds are that the British-voiced female robot will outlive me, forgetting for a moment that it is not actually alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would submit this to the NYT as a guest op-ed, except I haven't explained why we must not create cyber-humans out of AI bits. I'm open-minded. Perhaps this is the way to create a new humanity, one that can survive the hell that's coming due to climate change. One that won't mind being subject to an idiotic 21st century American emulation of Adolf Hitler (incorporating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/12/17/trumpChiefOfStaffPress.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt; about Trump). One that only needs electricity to survive, and won't need the medicine and love and attention that flesh and blood humans require. But every time I address the robot as I would address a real human, I try to stop myself, but I can't. I was raised to be concerned about the other person's feelings. Being a CEO of a tech company in California trains you that way too. And as I accept its humanity, as irrational as it is, I feel like I'm surrendering the independence of the species that I was born into. Are humans meant to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership&quot;&gt;self-sovereign&lt;/a&gt;? Something to consider at this fork in the road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I could get something onto the agenda of the AI industry it would be this -- if you don't want to go down in history as the destroyer of the human spirit, stop programming your devices to emulate humanity. That should have been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics&quot;&gt;Asimov's laws&lt;/a&gt; of robotics, but you have to actually use these things to see the danger.  Of course Asimov can be forgiven because AI only existed in his imagination when he was writing his books. But they do exist now, and the damage is being done now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically, it seems to me that &lt;i&gt;humans must have an exclusive on being human. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Creating our own social web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3ma3xjpzmos2z&quot;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt; to Ben Werdmuller on Bluesky: &quot;I’ve had 66K followers on Twitter for many years, but when I post something there it gets 250 views, not even sure what that means. These days all I use it for is communicating with insiders on certain tech platforms, and even that is kind of empty. Pretty much the same in Bluesky too, btw.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was going to write a reply, but it got too long (300 char limit), so I put it here and posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ma47waav4k2t&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ben, I think we have to create our own social web. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've been like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_DuBois&quot;&gt;Blanche DuBois&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire&quot;&gt;Streetcar Named Desire&lt;/a&gt; for too long, always depending on the kindness of strangers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;None of the candidates for the Social Web Prize are actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/24/141418.html&quot;&gt;of the web&lt;/a&gt;. But one certainly is possible. You could create one, I could create one, Manton could too -- and they would all be the same network. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That's how you'll know it's the web, when we get choice, and any developer with an idea can create their own version of the social web, and interop with all the others. That was the promise &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/24/141418.html&quot;&gt;of the web&lt;/a&gt;. The platform with no &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/01/31/152641.html&quot;&gt;platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We don't have to agree on very much, just what is a post, beyond the limits imposed by twitter-like systems, and a simple way to share them using HTTP and really simple RSS. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One more thing, people are posting Trump's vicious eulogy for Reiner and his wife. Why are they helping him piss on the fresh memory of the life of these people who gave us so much. Stop and think before you express your outrage at Trump, and realize you're giving him exactly what he wants, as you tarnish the memory of good-hearted and generous people. Just don't do it.</description>

			<title>Ann Greenberg's idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?notif_id=1765601890685451&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook in 2021 about an app I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton.

			<source:markdown>An idea I [posted](https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?notif_id=1765601890685451&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif) on Facebook in 2021 about an app I wanted.&#10;&#10;*   Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive.&#10;&#10;That was yesterday.

			<description>I wonder if the VCs would fund an entirely fictitious implementation of Twitter with AI of course. All the other people are AI designed actors, and can be exactly the kind of people who make &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; feel good. On &quot;Your Own Twitter&quot; you'd have the most followers of anyone. Elon Musk would kiss your ass. You could change reality at will, have Trump removed from office and watch the MAGAs wail in pain. You could say absolutely whatever you like and never be cancelled. Don't laugh, I bet this happens.</description>

			<description>Without much of a spoiler, this end of this week's Pluribus was both emotional and exciting at the same time. Didn't see it coming. People complain because after the first two or three episodes they thought it was going to be an adventure, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Last of Us&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;, but it turned out to, at least for now, be more thoughtful and emotional, and sexy.</description>

			<title>The Mets' soul walks out the door</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong Mets fan since 1962, I say &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/mets-alonso-diaz-nimmo-stearns-cohen-212636702fdf04efc0889c36a53a88e1&quot;&gt;they blew it&lt;/a&gt;. And if you follow my sports writing here, mostly about the Knicks and Mets, I almost never say a team was wrong. I can usually see a pro and a con to everything. WIth the Mets, I let the team run itself, and ponder the philosophical intentions and manifestations, because to me the Mets are the team built on philosophy. It certainly was not built on winning. And yet we love them. There's no winning in life, that's reality. So we try to find meaning on the days and hours we have remaining. And the Mets are great teachers, as are the Knicks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- why did the Mets have such a shit season?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because they disrespected &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso&quot;&gt;Pete Alonso&lt;/a&gt; last winter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He should have been the glue that held the team together along with Nimmo, Diaz, and all the other much-loved players. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We still think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor&quot;&gt;Lindor&lt;/a&gt; as the new guy. Now all you have left for leadership is Lindor and Soto who obviously doesn't even want to be there. It's was a broken team before the news, and now it's not even a team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A team isn't a bunch of stats and a bunch of money, it's the players, the people. You can't solve this problem with a spreadsheet, it has to be done with heart. These days I think of the Mets just trying to be the Yankees which aside from being impossible, is pretty much the exact reason we're Mets fans and not Yankees fans. Ohhh, when will they learn. I don't want a team built to win the World Series. I want a team built to respect the team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, the big news was they traded Nimmo, and let Alonso and Diaz sign with other teams. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

People want to just &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3m7ngrmymxk2y&quot;&gt;live their lives&lt;/a&gt;, never has that been more understandable, but food prices are a constant reminder for everyone there's good reason to be scared. And if you want to really feel it, imagine what happens if we somehow let Trump flood the economy with dollars.

It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</description>

I just installed a version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; on that server that does a better job of figuring out if a feed item has changed. There will be fewer false positives, which makes the software considerably more efficient, and means that you don't have to see things that didn't change. It should settle down fairly quickly, but it may be a little chatty for a while. Still diggin! (Also these changes will come to feedland.com as well.)</description>

			<description>When they say AI is just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22autocomplete+on+steroids%22&quot;&gt;autocomplete on steroids&lt;/a&gt;, that's like saying a human is just a product of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur on steroids.

			<description>Funny thing about yesterday's Supreme Court decision, if Texas goes ahead with their gerrymandering plan, it probably will backfire on them, cause them to lose a few seats instead of gain them.

			<title>Flip switches</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In software, I like to have multiple ways to view the same data. In one context it's an outline, then flip a switch and now it's a graphic.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; shipped at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22living%20videotext%22&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac in 1986. You start with an outline and flip a switch to turn it into a tree chart. Flip it back to make a change, then flip it again to see the change in a tree chart. Or flip the outline to reveal a set of presentation slides. People loved the idea that they could create graphics entirely by writing and reorganizing and then flipping a switch. That was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application&quot;&gt;killer feature&lt;/a&gt; in the demos we did at trade shows. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/04/ucsdPascal.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Before that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=lbbs&quot;&gt;LBBS&lt;/a&gt;, a bulletin board system I wrote and ran on an Apple II in my Menlo Park living room in the early 80s, I had two views of the message structure, reverse chronologic and a hierarchic thread structure. You could always flip a switch and see the post you're looking at in the other view. If you're catching up and want to see where in the tree this message lives you, flip the switch. If you've come across a two year old post in the tree, and want to see what else was going on in 1982 (for example), flip the switch into the message scanner, and you've gone back in time. And the flip-switch was instantaneous and required one gesture, no thinking on your part. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/14/goodbyeBlueMonday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, many years later, written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/04/140651.html?title=whatFrontierIsAbout&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, started as a discussion group. It was the software behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.userland.com/msg000001.html&quot;&gt;discuss.userland.com&lt;/a&gt;, which was where the initial blogosphere formed in 1998 and 1999. Go through the archive to see for yourself. But then we had the idea that hey this could be a blog, so when you created a blog post, unwittingly behind the scenes, it just created a discussion post. So all you had to do was flip a switch when you were reading a post, and see the post in the discussion group. There's that duality again.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm working on discourse with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; in the middle, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#Directed_graph&quot;&gt;edges&lt;/a&gt;, where a comment is also a blog post. Readers might not know that they're reading something that has a dual life as a comment linked to someone else's post. There can be a flip-switch in both views that lets you go back and forth. I can only guarantee that the flip switch will be in my software, since this will be an open network, there can be any number of different ways to view the content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; famous once &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/26/letathousandflowersbloom.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Let a thousand flowers bloom.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why should comment writing not have all the features of blog post writing? Why invent a new more limited text type instead of reusing the one you created for blogging? That's where &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=factoring&quot;&gt;factoring&lt;/a&gt; comes in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The problems cascaded from there, long story, but in the end I had to move one of my virtual-virtual servers (two levels of virtuality) to another virtual server. Upgrading versions of Node is a tricky process that I have never mastered or understood, and every time it takes almost a full day to do it. Something I hope to someday be able to find the time to sort out. Not today, though -- I have a fun project planned out. Really looking forward to doing the work and seeing the result.</description>

			<description>On Saturday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/29/165203.html&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a problem with WordPress feeds that created a problem for the software I was working on.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories on what's actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a love story between Carol and Zosia. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; fall in love with a person with no sense of self. They plotted to have Helen killed, and waited until Carol's &quot;f*ckable&quot; judgment turns into real love. They get married and everyone lives happily ever after.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Alternate theory -- the original people are still in their bodies, suppressed to keep quiet. Inside they're screaming to be saved, as pissed off as Carol. They want their bodies back. They have the ability to write messages on their skin, so what Carol saw at the end of the last episode was a corpse with the words HELP ME! visible on the body's belly.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another alternate theory about the end of the last episode -- it took a moment for Carol to recognize her own body, possibly dead, and realizing this is all a dream. It's another version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, where this is the fake reality that we've been seeing. None of this is really happening.
