Now that I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/26/150516.html&quot;&gt;voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; that creates transcripts exactly where I need them, I can feed the narration to ChatGPT and ask it to write docs based on features I describe that are part of the current software, and leave out notes about possible changes or additions. It took me 13 minutes to do the narration, because I talk more slowly than it writes, and I ramble and get distracted. It took the bot less than a second to produce a near-perfect outline. It left out a bit that I wanted included, it was added in a second. Then I asked for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; version of the docs so I could edit it, and pass back the edited version. It got a bit confused and gave me a JSON version of the outline, and Node.js code to convert it to the XML, but when I pointed out a simpler way to do it, I got what I needed in less than a second. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/docsOutline.png&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;, in my outliner, ready for me to add notes, and edit and reorganize. ChatGPT is a team member, not a surrogate. Another amazing experience, absolutely no going back.</description>

			<description>Saw a video where Elon Musk talks about climate change, no snark, didn't call it a hoax, was intelligent and serious. Also heard that he's backing Trump for president, who  says it's a hoax and one of his major campaign promises is to &quot;drill baby drill.&quot; Maybe they could discuss this because there seems to be a disagreement here.</description>

			<title>The Kitty at the Carnegie</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wordle Kitty is rumored to be the VP choice for the Dems. She is at the Carnegie Deli in NYC to meet the Republican VP candidate, to talk about a debate, but the Repub is a no-show! Weird. Meanwhile the press is having fun asking her embarrassing questions about a cat in the White House. They want to know if the WH has a litter box. What if she gets pregnant? Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/kittyAtTheCarnegieDeli.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Such a big sandwich for such a cute kitty! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tonykahn.org/home&quot;&gt;this autobiographical site&lt;/a&gt; where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn't often credited. He was at WGBH at the time.</description>

			<description>Where is the AI-based meme maker for Kamala. I'd like to have her flying in the sky with a cape, like SuperPresidentLady, going from town to town, finding out what they need, and churning it out for them in an efficiently run government meme factory in the nation's capital. Like we were doing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kitten&quot;&gt;kittens&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer.</description>
