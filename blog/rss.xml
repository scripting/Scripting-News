			<description>A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the michegas. My advice -- please -- do your protesting, resisting, DEIing, organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself with love even if the world isn't. So in that spirit for those of us who love cats -- a &lt;a href=&quot;https://prisonjournalismproject.org/2024/10/23/cats-came-to-my-california-prison/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I live in a place now with a score of zero, you can't do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019&quot;&gt;score&lt;/a&gt; of 99. I'd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out. Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its network, but doesn't reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).</description>

We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/&quot;&gt;ISOJ conference in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves&quot;&gt;Rosental Alves&lt;/a&gt;,  that his audience wouldn't like me. He is gentle generous person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was something I wanted to see. But in the Q&amp;A period, it all came out. Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white man and in their minds I couldn't have failed. Do they really believe that? Swimming upstream isn't easy for anyone. The experience at that conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories, when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but a lot of them didn't come from billionaires and VCs. I don't study the creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative &lt;i&gt;people.&lt;/i&gt; I tried to write the truth, didn't always succeed and sometimes I had to retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to what I believe. The &quot;white men bad&quot; thing was an excuse for people to say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from &quot;the woke&quot; which is a term I despise, what's wrong with being awake, what's the alternative, being asleep? dead? -- these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing, really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain is hard to forget.</description>

			<description>I was just thinking about themes for WordPress, and thought to look up Manila themes, and found we have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.userland.com/newsItems/viewDepartment$New%20Radio%20Theme&quot;&gt;whole website&lt;/a&gt; that's still &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.userland.com/about&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; (thanks Jake!) where you can see the catalog of themes we had for Manila and Radio (thanks Bryan Bell!). I want something like this for WordPress themes that work beautifully with WordLand-authored blogs.</description>

			<description>I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy editor would. I hope we're heading there. And if they have this, put it behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an experienced copy editor to do imho.</description>

			<description>We're getting into WordPress in a new way, the need for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/64&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt; came from users. I didn't know they had this feature in WordPress. If you asked me if it did, I would have said yes, I'm sure it does, but where and what is it called? i could've gotten that too via chatgpt, but i would have had to think of it. that's where having sharp users makes a world of difference. When people thank me for my generosity, they don't get it. I want something out of it, your experience and your mind. It's one of my main raw materials.</description>

			<description>With all the good stuff happening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; I haven't found time to wind down feedland.com and feedland.org. The servers are still working, though not performing as I'd like them to, but it doesn't seem I'm going to get the time to do a graceful transition before my self-imposed March 31 deadline. So I'll come up with a new plan, and if you're using either of these services, enjoy! and keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/forewarned-is-forearmed&quot;&gt;backing up&lt;/a&gt; your subscription list.</description>

A few months back someone told me that I had been gone from the podcast world for too long for anyone to listen to me. I thought how weird, I didn't go anywhere at all, I stayed exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; I was, all the time. Virtually every day.

They're right. It is a small piece that can be hooked into lots of places, as is WordPress a big place that can host lots of apps many of which haven't been written yet. Products that look outward that can be hooked up in a million ways to everything, and leave the door open for those who follow. Such products are rare in our world. People always try to own their users by locking out competitors. I found a perfect spot for me to put some software, and I am having fun watching people use it, and coming up with new features that build on what we have. I think the writing tools market for WordPress will be huge, and I firmly believe that will turn into what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, which you could also think of as just the web. Ben thinks of it as the &quot;indie web,&quot; and that's fine. It's all just the web. Anyway, I should have put something here a long time ago, but I didn't look inside WordPress until a couple of years ago and I really liked what I found.</description>

			<description>Mini-spoilers follow. I'm a Severance lover, it's definitely one of the best shows ever, and I feel even more so after the season 2 finale which I watched last night on AppleTV+. I think there are two types of Severance users. One whose focus is on the evil and the other whose focus is on the love. If you think nothing happened in the finale then you're the first type, if you are the second type, this episode was incredible rich. And we learned what the goats were about and that's not nothing.</description>

This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to ingest everything it can find. Worried about hallucinations. But with a product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests are not problems with WordLand itself. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/62&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where you can report on your experience.

			<description>I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeffcnichols.net/2025/03/20/the-writers-web-aka-blogging/&quot;&gt;Jeff Nichols' piece&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't agree that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt; is blogging. I think it's bigger. Blogging is &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the writer's web. Today's writing network is much more powerful, the software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn't exist last time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better because it's of the web, with &lt;i&gt;no limits. &lt;/i&gt;We've got the beginning of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing and reading environments, and we don't need federation because the web takes care of that.</description>

So Twitter made subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky, etc mostly can't get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking about it and while they do, we're losing everything that's important to us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can't all be masters of our own silo'd domain. We need a web for words that's simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn't lose the essential features writers need. I don't know what we need to win, but I do know what we need to get started.</description>

			<title>Using ChatGPT for tech support</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong. It has infinite time to help, and won’t mind if the problem turned out to be a random browser plug-in that was misbehaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It often suggests trying things you might not have thought of.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use it myself esp as often is the case there’s no one who can or is willing to work for me for free. I’m already playing it $20 per month, and for that I get as much time as it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Really good for organizing your approach to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A piece that Paul Krugman should write. How what Musk is doing to the US is worse than the 2009 near-collapse of the world economy. People who think he's going to bring down just the US, should recall how close we all came to falling into the abyss. But this time there will be no one to save us.</description>

			<description>The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things that don't belong to them. There's no policing. The richest people are the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people's creations. That's the common theme. Now they're in DC, going for all of it. The whole thing. But they're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0&quot;&gt;dog that catches the car&lt;/a&gt;. They don't have the slightest idea what to do with what they're taking. How could they? It's incomprehensibly vast.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415&quot;&gt;data behind&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/16/blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh/&quot;&gt;WordLand blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few days ago. I'm publishing these so people get an idea of the structures we're working with. It's basically a WordPress post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS, Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out, there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2, Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol, Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol designer, don't try to plan for things you don't have a working model of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together will work much better. And only add things you're willing to live with forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the format we work with inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, and more important, in the new APIs, that build on and simplify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpcom&quot;&gt;excellent API&lt;/a&gt; that Automattic had already produced.</description>

			<title>John Palfrey on the moment</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn't happened yet. A lot of people weren't yet aware. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt;, who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I'm going to publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the places I'm hooked into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out loud in public: &quot;we believe in the rule of law in America&quot;? That seems not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this topic is what is striking me most at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing, to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with impunity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves just one. This is not &quot;fancy law stuff&quot;. This is &quot;4th grade civics stuff&quot; -- separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we don't teach civics enough in America...).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It is actually *not* more complicated than that. It can't be that hard to say out loud: &quot;we value the rule of law in America&quot; -- no matter your politics or party.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

That will continue to happen if the rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with impunity." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/18/185358.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>

			<title>Get back on the air</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Dems highest priority should be to get the Kamala Harris campaign back on social media, 24 by 7, with the truth and snark, irreverance, disrespectful of the Repubs, as a matter of principle. They were great. Perfect. We need a voice for the Democrats on the social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would someone please send this to AOC, Jasmine Crockett, Bernie Sanders, Mark Cuban, James Carville, anyone else you can think of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems only problem is there is no voice, no pulse, no heartbeat. Even without this, they almost won the last election. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything you like about government came from the Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We miss you. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22on%20the%20air%22&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; on the air! No time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Poking around on old servers I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsonify.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;this cute little app&lt;/a&gt; that jsonifies an RSS feed.

			<title>Blogging is due for a refresh</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Websockets have replaced long polling. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SQL is fast and the tools are much better.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from  twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to get a list of old school bloggers who are still at it. How would you go about that? I decided to give it to Gemini, limiting it at first to 100 bloggers. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/finding-old-school-bloggers-who-are-still-at-it/&quot;&gt;prompt&lt;/a&gt; I wrote. For a while I was wondering what &quot;deep research&quot; was for, but as it's starting the work, I'm thinking of resources that would fit in -- like blogtree.com -- a fascinating site, gives a clear picture how blogs emerge out of the community of an earlier blog. Anyway it's working on it while I write this post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Anyway it's working on it while I write this post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 15 Mar 2025 13:59:01 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/15.html#a135901"/>

			<description>An application ChatGPT is great it. You're staring at some code, it's really straightforward, you've done this a thousand times, but it doesn't work. Stare at it some more. Try re-entering it. Change the names of things. Still doesn't work. Copy and paste the problem code into ChatGPT and in an instant it tells you without you even having to ask that your comment isn't properly terminated, so the runtime was never seeing the code, and nothing I did made the slightest difference. The information was there. I had been staring at it, but humans see what we expect to see. Machines don't have that problem, at least not in this way (thinking of hallucinations).</description>

I hope you can see that I have no trouble deploying https sites here. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; on my Linux servers, and I don't see why anyone uses anything else. It's really easy and requires none of the work people complain about. Anyway the reason scripting.com is http and not https is that the site dates back to 1994, before there was such a thing as https. Google didn't start their push to get the web to convert to https until 2014, 20 years after I started blogging. Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/12/31.html&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, the're pretty much all there. This is something I'm proud of. I wanted to create a record from the start, it was very deliberate. I was already an experienced developer when the web started up, so I had an idea what I was doing. I also use images on my site, in the right margin of posts, and lately as &quot;inline&quot; images, in their own boxes with a caption. It's a way for me to play with the ideas, and adds color to pages that are almost all text. So if I were to move the site from S3 to one of my hosted servers, which would be a fairly major undertaking on its own and add a lot of overhead because Amazon takes care of a lot of the bullshit you have to deal with, there would be a small matter of what about the images? They would all break if scripting.com was hosted on https and they were served from http. Now you might say -- Dave all you have to do is move all those images to a place with https support and remap the domains, and take care of all the michegas that's going to pop up. Or suffer with broken images. I decided to instead tell Google to stop trying to own something that belongs to no one and everyone. If they want a more secure web, create it, and make a browser for it, and respect the original web alone. Hopefully this clears it up.</description>

			<description>I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67d580b2-8a68-8012-ad1a-65f2553978bb&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; when Google started making HTTPS a requirement. Then I asked when was HTTPS first deployed, and was surprised it was in 1994 in Netscape Navigator. But apparently it was really buggy and wasn't codified until much later. Then I asked when HTTPS became the norm? 2017. So there's a lot of web out there that isn't being maintained by anyone, it just works, that predates HTTPS being widely adopted, if you believe the timelines ChatGPT produced.</description>

			<description>Another BTW, I'm still thinking about how I want to transition from the public and open-to-anyone FeedLand servers. So if you're still using .org or .com, they're still on the air doing the same thing they've been doing all along.</description>

			<description>I heard an idea that really resonated in a Brian Lehrer &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.pocketcasts.com/podcasts/0c3b41f0-2c8b-012e-09b1-00163e1b201c/15570ad4-8994-4fe9-83fc-1966fe0e6795&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Giridharadas&quot;&gt;Anand Giridharadas&lt;/a&gt;, who says among many other things, that we should aim our ire at the &lt;i&gt;leaders&lt;/i&gt; of the MAGA movement, and stop bringing our angst to the people who voted for them. Every time I see a condescending TikTok story about them, I think about how that takes us further from getting where we must go. We have to reconcile, we share a country, and our interests are totally aligned. We need each other, that will become completely obvious, and the sooner it does the better.</description>
