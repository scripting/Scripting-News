			<title>JD Vance is a punchline, illustrated</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to illustrate this idea: &quot;JD Vance is a punchline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/04/jdVanceIsAPunchline.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&quot;JD Vance is a punchline.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's time to create our own media, again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're depending on big companies that are nuzzling up with Trump, at best hedging their bets, to let us use their networks to organize ourselves politically. That's never worked for us, in fact it's worked against us. Trump's election in 2016, for example, could he have done it without Twitter letting him go direct to organize? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Harris organization is doing great, they have to take on the journalists, where previous Democrats had no answer, they've done it in a clever way, by using their channels to talk about the things journalism should be talking about. People listen to their competition, and that's what this is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to do this, a few of us, who are good listeners and writers, to build lists of sources and provide them for people to access away from the nonstop (often entertaining) bullshit of the social web of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked for ideas for podcasts that would go into a list of shows people who are voting Democratic would find interesting or useful. Not for spreading religion, but based on facts, not the unhinged lunacy and revenge of Trump. Our news now is too polluted by that. He shouldn't be able to lie about Harris's race, and have that be an issue carried by journalism, for example. That should not be possible but it happens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/04/timeToCreateOurOwnMediaAgain.m4a&quot;&gt;12 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Kitten trashes suite</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I solve a Wordle puzzle, I'm allowed to switch over to ChatGPT and narrate a new scene for the Wordle Kitty. Here's today's installment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The cute and adorable Wordle Kitty, Democratic VP candidate, got tired of waiting for the Republican, so she took a few of the reporters with her back to the presidential suite at the Plaza Hotel on 5th Ave and had a drunken night of debauchery with the reporters and totally trashed the place. The next morning the story appeared in The NY Times. Headline read “Adorable kitten trashes suite.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/04/kittyTrashesSuite.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;What remains of the Presidential Suite at the Plaza Hotel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Now that I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/26/150516.html&quot;&gt;voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; that creates transcripts exactly where I need them, I can feed the narration to ChatGPT and ask it to write docs based on features I describe that are part of the current software, and leave out notes about possible changes or additions. It took me 13 minutes to do the narration, because I talk more slowly than it writes, and I ramble and get distracted. It took the bot less than a second to produce a near-perfect outline. It left out a bit that I wanted included, it was added in a second. Then I asked for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; version of the docs so I could edit it, and pass back the edited version. It got a bit confused and gave me a JSON version of the outline, and Node.js code to convert it to the XML, but when I pointed out a simpler way to do it, I got what I needed in less than a second. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/docsOutline.png&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;, in my outliner, ready for me to add notes, and edit and reorganize. ChatGPT is a team member, not a surrogate. Another amazing experience, absolutely no going back.</description>

			<description>Saw a video where Elon Musk talks about climate change, no snark, didn't call it a hoax, was intelligent and serious. Also heard that he's backing Trump for president, who  says it's a hoax and one of his major campaign promises is to &quot;drill baby drill.&quot; Maybe they could discuss this because there seems to be a disagreement here.</description>

			<title>The Kitty at the Carnegie</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wordle Kitty is rumored to be the VP choice for the Dems. She is at the Carnegie Deli in NYC to meet the Republican VP candidate, to talk about a debate, but the Repub is a no-show! Weird. Meanwhile the press is having fun asking her embarrassing questions about a cat in the White House. They want to know if the WH has a litter box. What if she gets pregnant? Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/kittyAtTheCarnegieDeli.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Such a big sandwich for such a cute kitty! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tonykahn.org/home&quot;&gt;this autobiographical site&lt;/a&gt; where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn't often credited. He was at WGBH at the time.</description>

			<description>Where is the AI-based meme maker for Kamala. I'd like to have her flying in the sky with a cape, like SuperPresidentLady, going from town to town, finding out what they need, and churning it out for them in an efficiently run government meme factory in the nation's capital.
