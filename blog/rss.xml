			<title>WordPress destiny, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Glad I wrote the piece I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html?title=wordPressDestiny1&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could have written it any time in the last year as I was investigating and developing on the WordPress API and back end, but now seemed to be a good time, with all the attention its getting, and Matt's interviews, I and others are getting a better idea of what the various components of the community are. I don't know about the rest of you, but I had only a vague idea of what WordPress is beyond a piece of software used for commerce and to a lesser extent these days, writing on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few ideas -- not in any particular order:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;From my point of view, blogging and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress is being built &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; more than being built on, when it is such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;potent&lt;/a&gt; and surprisingly open &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt;. I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is a strong foundation that you could build &lt;i&gt;any kind of writing software&lt;/i&gt; on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we'd be compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; are amazing. I don't say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The company desperately needs an evangelism function.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one (which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the Facebook platform, btw -- and from a software design perspective it's brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpidentity&lt;/a&gt; package I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election Facebook's API was radically restricted, not something many people know about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn't appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory their server could be cloned (it's open source) but it certainly could be emulated at an API level. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's enticing. All those users -- there should be a market for writing tools there, but there isn't. Why is that??&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I feel like we're like ships passing in the night. I thought I should point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction I don't understand and don't see why I should want to. Did they care when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original blogosphere? I don't see any evidence of it. It's like Walmart sought to build a shopping center on the remains of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria&quot;&gt;Library of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;. People don't seem to have any respect for independent writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and &lt;i&gt;the dream was realized.&lt;/i&gt; No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And no wonder journalism doesn't defend it, they are offended by the idea of people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we do. We're their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer&quot;&gt;John Naughton's piece&lt;/a&gt; today in the Guardian. He's doing more to focus attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge, something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn't have to wait for Matt to turn in that direction. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some thoughts as the world seems to be converging on something, not sure what. There are so many doors that are now open that never were before, the question is -- do we have the courage to connect the dots and work together, or do we all insist on going our own ways to a fairly dark future.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you're a developer, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; you use in browser-JS code for the wpidentity package. This was the way Facebook packaged their API for developers, and it was far more efficient than the way Twitter did and WordPress too. So I added this to the stack, and built on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How about those Mets, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of 2015, when the Mets were so charmed -- they could be down 9-0 in the 8th inning and you would tune into the game to see how they'd win it. It's not the usual thing for the Mets, who pull defeat from the jaws of victory far more often than the other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And omg, 2024 is shaping up the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sit down and shut up, here come the Mets!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, because I have stuff to do -- the Mets were down 1-0 in the bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks like it's going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time down and to the right. You could try to swing but you'd have to be very lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they took out Wheeler (pitchers don't do complete games any longer, they used to). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Mets were ready. Hit after hit after hit and before you knew it, it was 5-1. Alonso, the star of the last Milwaukee game drove in one of the runs with a long sacrifice fly to center.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Phillies and their fans who had been so confident of victory were shocked. And left to plan for today's game at 4PM on Fox. You gotta know where I'll be -- glued to the set and dreaming about the fate of this Mets team who shows real signs of strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=mets+philosophy+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>WordPress has a greater destiny</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years before WordPress came out, I did a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22radio+userland%22&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; which was a combination &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/024232.html?title=radioUserlandScreenShot&quot;&gt;blogging tool&lt;/a&gt; and feed reader. Two main screens, a streamlined UI. You could get in quickly, write and publish a post in a minute, and see it show up in the reader a moment later. It worked, and it added a major new component to the blogging world, and I think still represents the simplest most focused UI for writing. It was a really popular product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same idea, really simple blog post writing and editing, with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; that should be available to web writers, optional titles, links, simple styling, enclosures, the ability to edit. The things the common social web apps generally &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This imho is a huge opportunity. I wish this is where the focus in the WordPress community was, but I think right now the world is building &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; WordPress, not on it. It could be great, it could totally solve the problem of a new document standard in the social web that makes it really like the web. Instead they're fighting over who owns what part of the WordPress trademark, at least as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Last year I created a Node.js package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpidentity&lt;/a&gt; that acts as a bridge between a browser-based JavaScript app and the WordPress back-end, and the result is fine. It suggests that there could be a developer community writing apps that all join up in the middle in WordPress's database. Pretty powerful idea! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I think the users, the writers, would love it, because we developers could &lt;b&gt;compete to delight them&lt;/b&gt;, and not have to worry about building a huge server capability as Automattic already has debugged and scaled. And maybe the battle that's going on now could fade into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How about those Mets!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/04/caseyStengelMetsManager.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;We are a Mets family. Around the kitchen table in my childhood home, the default question was &quot;What did the Mets do?&quot; Before I was born we were a Brooklyn Dodgers family, always National League, but the Dodgers left shortly after I was born and the Mets came along when I was seven, and that was it for us. It was the one thing we all agreed on -- the Mets. Much later when my Mom and I would fight about something, a pretty regular thing -- I invented what I called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hello.typepad.com/hello/2009/11/shea-stadium-rules.html&quot;&gt;Shea Stadium Rules&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that a disagreement could be tabled when we remember that underneath everything we are true Mets fans, and ultimately Mets fans can find something to agree on -- that rain or shine and there was plenty of rain, we always stood with our team. A deeper truth of the Mets was we didn't really mind when they lost. Because underneath it all at a whole other level, the Mets have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that is strong. We are the Mets and that's all you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last night it wasn't lookin good. It was a winner-take-all game with the hated (for now) Milwaukee Brewers. We hated them because it looked like they were going to end the Mets season in the first round of the playoffs. I was getting ready to take off my Mets cap for the year, and put on my Knicks cap, when Lindor walked, then Nimmo singled, and with runners on first and third and one out, Pete Alonso comes to the plate. He's been cold all year. I hoped for a base hit or at least a long sacrifice fly to bring in the runner on third. I couldn't watch but forced myself to. And then &lt;b&gt;it happened&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We who have been joined at the heart to this team and have been through it all, have come to expect failure, but sometimes winning happens, as it did last night. A big swing. The bat connects. Oh please let it land anywhere but the glove of a Brewer, and then all of a sudden Alonso is jogging around the bases, and delirium takes over, in the living room of my mountain home and everywhere Mets fans were at that fateful hour. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We figured at that point they might as well just retire the side, but the Metsies, who Casey Stengel, the first manager asked &quot;Can't anyone play this stinkin game!&quot; -- brought in another run, which it turns out we didn't need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Brewers were overwhelmed. They tried to score in the bottom of the ninth but the Mets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; was too strong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like every baseball kid's fantasy -- the count is 3 and 2 ,the team's back is to the wall, up comes the slugger, the crowd is silent and then he hits it &lt;b&gt;out of the park&lt;/b&gt; and the team emerges victorious and the young person's fantasy saves the day. We've all been there, many times. Last night we got to live it, again, this time for real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now we go to Philadelphia to give them a proper dose of New York love. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Mets meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Game 1 of the NLDS begins tomorrow at 4PM. Good times will be had by all (except Philadelphia fans of course).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This wasn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/08/baseballCanTeachUsAboutLif.html#p9&quot;&gt;Mookie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/whole-new-ballgame/new-york-mets-1986-world-series&quot;&gt;game 6 &lt;/a&gt;of the 1986 World Series, but it was along those lines of improbability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I love that they give a realtime readout on screen of the probability of each team winning. At the top of the ninth, before all the michegas, the Mets had only a 6% chance of winning. I think every game should come with a graph over time of this stat. It would be an emotional map, much more interesting than the other stats.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>AI deflates the value of expertise</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I didn't read the WSJ story about the deflation of expertise, quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla&quot;&gt;Vinod Khosla&lt;/a&gt;, Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who I know from my time in California. He says AI leads to a deflation of expertise. I agree with him, AI absolutely deflates the value of expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It aggregates all of our knowledge in one place where it's easy to access, about anything you want to know. It answers questions that you can't get any other way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think about it. That's not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that didn't have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without television, and I didn't use a computer until I was 18 or use the web until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has been stretched before and I'm well educated and in my work have explored frontiers of knowledge, even so -- this is the most mind-stretching experience I've ever had. Not kidding. And I'm not a VC or prone to overhyping tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is a writing portal?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So far we've only created reading portals. What I want for myself and for you, is a writing portal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A reading portal brings a lot of writers together so you can read them all in one place.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A writing portal is the same idea but in reverse. I write in my portal, and it flows where ever I want it to.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem is the reading portals aren't open to allow this to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all want you to write in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trade Secrets Radio: &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting&quot;&gt;What is podcasting?&lt;/a&gt; This is the exact moment, 9/24/2004, that podcasting got its name and its definition. It's pretty short. We knew what we were doing. We loved what RSS did for news. Now we were doing the same for radio. Not just talking about it, but finally -- doing it. It worked, pretty freaking well. There's a podcast episode to go with it, coming out shortly.</description>

If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.</description>

			<description>I had a dream last night with many of my dead relatives present. We were at some kind of social event. My grandfather had a new wife or girlfriend, but he didn't recognize me, though he pretended to. My mother was far off in the distance taking pictures. I wonder what that means. Some of them &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; dead and gone. I had to remind myself of that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.) My subconscious has a clear idea of who they are/were, only it doesn't register that some of them are gone.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-posting is here now.
