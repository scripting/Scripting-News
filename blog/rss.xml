And as he's doing that, I'm slogging away the same way I've always done it, working on the top level user interface of WordLand in browser-based JavaScript. I don't see a way around it, because I have a special way of working on user interfaces, and we're still quite a ways away from the bot being able to do vibe coding at that level. It's fascinating to watch Jake revive code I wrote in the late 80s and early 90s. He's a very accomplished user of it, being transformed, with the help of the bots, into a kernel-level developer of what's basically an OS built around a scripting language, object database and with the internet latched on after the whole thing was done, and then ported to Windows. I stopped working at that level before all that michegas happened. I have looked at the code Jake is working on to see what became of it, and wasn't horrified, I recognized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/snippets/nerdsguide.html&quot;&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt;, but I wouldn't ever want to work on that myself. I imagine some commercial developers have already rebuilt their testing and support functions for products around ChatGPT-like systems. If you're an old Frontier fanatic, that's where our product is once again getting out in front. When Jake is done it'll be one of the first big systems totally managed in an AI system. It should be relatively easy to add new verbs to the language, even to add new features to the language.</description>

			<description>Another example of ChatGPT utility. &quot;I have a function named Boo. Inside it has an icon that when you click it, it calls Boo to view the parent of the item. But I don't want it to call Boo directly because that leaves the previous instance of viewFeedItem around. In JavaScript what's the best way to defer the call to Boo so that the two instances are unrelated, and the first instance goes away.&quot; I was pretty sure as I wrote this that setTimeout was the answer, but ChatGPT offered it as the first choice, and explained why it was the best. It's like having a code consulant ready to help. And it really does help to know it parsed it the same way I did.</description>

			<title>Sports galore!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Boy are we getting some fancy sports action. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Olympics have already started, with Milan as the host city. The opening ceremony is tonight. My longtime friend, the brilliant and beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/profile/annamasera&quot;&gt;Anna Masera&lt;/a&gt;, will be attending. She's from the nearby city of Torino. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course there will be lots of sports action on Sunday, when by coincidence, the Knicks are playing the Celtics in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And also in case you're into American football -- the SuperBowl is on Sunday in my former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium&quot;&gt;home base&lt;/a&gt; of Silicon Valley, featuring the New England Patriots (booo) and the Seattle Seahawks (booo two). 6:30PM Eastern on Peacock and NBC. (They say &quot;simulcast&quot; on NBC, which means what?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I'm sooo freaking tired of working on reading and replying in WordLand, but I gotta get it done. I hope to have a test version up real soon, like maybe next week. I'll write some more about that in a bit. I want people to be prepared for the new design, you won't be replying on my site, you'll be replying on yours. This is the price we pay for true distribution. But when you're reading the posts and replies, it's all seamless. No cost. And, if my site goes away, your writing remains where it was, where you wrote it, on &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; site. This is what's new about WordLand. We respect the web and we respect you. I'm not trying to lock you in, just trying to set an example for the rest of the tech world. Give us all a way to avoid being locked in the trunk while the tech oligarchs have stadiums and train stations named after them (and if they think that makes them immortal, please tell me who Mr or Ms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium&quot;&gt;Shea&lt;/a&gt; was? Heh.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now one thing some people are sure to be upset about, up front. WordLand only knows how to write to WordPress sites. It's kind of a miracle we can do that, mostly owing to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wpcom&quot;&gt;fantastic API&lt;/a&gt; they have created. After we get that going, of course I want to work with other blogging systems to make sure their products can be used in the same way. Working together we're going to give the good old web a new feature! But right now I'm the only person working on this, and I'm pretty old for doing this kind of work, so please be kind. Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wrote an app that implements &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpInbound&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; sites. Three months ago, a few little glitches but remarkably reliable. Open source. That's how I have scripting.com output hooked up to daveverse.org input. It stopped working this morning, not sure why. This is actually a test to see if this works. (Postscript: It did work. But I have two earlier posts today that did not get through.)</description>

			<description>We need a short name for &lt;i&gt;ChatGPT-like product.&lt;/i&gt; If I want to make a general statement about products in the category, there is, as far as I know, no word to use. Same with Twitter and tweet, so I call them &lt;i&gt;twitter-like&lt;/i&gt; products and use tweet for posts to any twitter-like product. The whole idea of a different name (like toot, skeet) for each service is linguistic travesty. Anyway, &lt;i&gt;ChatGPT-like&lt;/i&gt; is also an unacceptable term. If it had a fun name like OurMind -- then &lt;i&gt;OurMind-like&lt;/i&gt; would work. If only &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; were here.</description>
