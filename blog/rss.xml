			<title>Broken images suck, Google</title>

Every image in every page breaks. Broken images make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/22/statement.png&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, they're like broken windows, they say no one gives a F about this site. Well I care about the archive of scripting.com, I hope people understand that. I have been creating a record here since 1994. It'll be 30 years in October.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to blackmail me into breaking my archive, Google should be helping to preserve it. And not just mine, the entire early web. We poured our hearts and hopes into this, and massive amounts of time, without which Google would not exist.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know Google doesn't have a heart and it isn't a living thing, but it's bad PR to make that so freaking obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think that perhaps Google is already run by the machines. Maybe it was the first such company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To remind you of what Google's idea of the ancient web is, I put a broken image next to this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why we're lucky WordPress is here and other topics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this week reviewing the UI of Radio UserLand, released in 2002. It was both a feed reader and a writing tool.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and Facebook, and they said they weren't blogs, and presumably would start a new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. The new blogging platforms were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo&quot;&gt;silos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11 years to fully appreciate, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;give up&lt;/a&gt; on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did. There were some it couldn't cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of software on the desktop). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server&lt;/a&gt; idea realized. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So for example, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;, which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed. This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the file system. The product didn't live long enough to fulfill the potential of that feature. The idea was that you could use any editor you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;editor&lt;/a&gt; we supplied with Radio was one of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;, but I hoped that better editors would emerge. I wanted to make one myself, combining the outliner in Frontier with scripting, to drop posts into the folder structure that Radio expected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Radio's tiny little textbox circa 2002.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;. Dropbox was so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but they wouldn't go the final step, in creating a class of content that could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user didn't have enough control for it to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be revolutionary. How do I know? Because that's how computers worked before the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I'm going to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for it, at least to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully at some point I'll be able to turn that over to Automattic and have them run it, or if they don't want to, maybe someone else will. But it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation before the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technology does go backwards, a lot -- we lose valuable things without any thought, when we could keep them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, that's why it's good to keep some old people around, we might remember the things that were lost. I'm trying to make sure the really good ideas, the keepers, get another chance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/blogrollscreen.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Another random morning bit -- something subtle in the blogroll you might not have noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog posts typically have titles, social media posts do not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is opinionated about this -- it &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it's pretty simple. &lt;span&gt;If it doesn't have a title use the description&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way. What if motorcycles, cars, trucks and bikes couldn't all use the same roads? What kind of way would that be to run a civilization. Same thing with feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some don't. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn't show that difference that in the user interface. The users don't care and rightly so. It's confusing and takes their attention away from the writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress's RSS feeds. If I start a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for the post. That's the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title, which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs shouldn't change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don't know if they can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can't depend on the title being there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a &lt;i&gt;social web,&lt;/i&gt; and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Another random morning bit -- something subtle in the blogroll you might not have noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog posts typically have titles, social media posts do not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is opinionated about this -- it &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that guidance.

				<source:outline text="Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress's RSS feeds. If I start a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for the post. That's the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title, which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs shouldn't change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don't know if they can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can't depend on the title being there." created="Thu, 21 Mar 2024 13:18:46 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/21/125505.html#a131846"/>
				<source:outline text="Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a &lt;i&gt;social web,&lt;/i&gt; and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections." created="Thu, 21 Mar 2024 15:37:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/21/125505.html#a153700"/>

			<description>Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to Raptors. He wasn't the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them. He has a competitive grace you don't see very often. Quickley was one of those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team, he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side, if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks win they way they are winning now. That's what I want from developing software. I want to create a global team of truly independent developers, filling the void left by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation&quot;&gt;predation&lt;/a&gt; of the silos. There won't even be a business model for much of what we do, but there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We're going to play a game we started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can't produce end-user software much longer, but I don't want to leave until we have this thing rebooted.</description>

			<description>When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties, because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate. Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it's a good question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.</description>

			<description>Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features. Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.</description>

I once thought I could make server products or toolkits for people I called &quot;poets&quot; -- motivated writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results, I've seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; technical to work. If they knew what was required, my 2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/07/012112.html&quot;&gt;Julia Child&lt;/a&gt;, a hero of mine, believed she could teach anyone to be a good-enough cook. But I bet she was frustrated by human reality. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="I'm working with developers again, thank goodness. I once thought I could make server products or toolkits for people I called &quot;poets&quot; -- motivated writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results, I've seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; technical to work. If they knew what was required, my 2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/07/012112.html&quot;&gt;Julia Child&lt;/a&gt;, a hero of mine, believed she could teach anyone to be a good-enough cook. But I bet she was frustrated by human reality. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 18 Mar 2024 14:19:55 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/18/juliaChild.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/18.html#a141955"/>

I wanted to read the damn thing, that's why I clicked on it. Not to see some cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/thispageisnottherehahahah&quot;&gt;404 page&lt;/a&gt; (although it is pretty nice).

			<description>Saying the web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social&quot;&gt;misses&lt;/a&gt; Google Reader is like saying the United States misses President Trump. Why do I think that? Think of the mess Google left behind when they dumped the web. Putting all our cards in one basket in software is a very very very very bad idea. As everyone who misses The Orange Feed Reader is evidence of. It's like someone rips you off bad and all you can think about is how much you miss them. You, sir or madam, need to get your head examined.</description>

			<description>The blogroll is a lot like weblogs.com combined with its successor my.userland.com. All this happened first in 1999. Today's blogroll is far in advance technically from the blogrolls of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/03.html&quot;&gt;25 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>When I was growing up they taught us that humans were the only animals that were conscious. They wasn't any scientific evidence of this, we know now, because it obviously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@theheralddiary/post/C4iTyzBMATf&quot;&gt;isn't true&lt;/a&gt;. And to my own credit, I was sure it was bullshit when I was a kid.</description>

			<description>Finally seeing a real blogroll bug. We're getting notified that feeds are updating that we aren't following, yet they're showing up in my blogroll anyway. Either have to add some code or look for a bug. Good thing I've got the only really deployed blogroll now.</description>

			<description>This is a nit, but it bugs me anyway. I'd love to know why Threads, which in every way is a modern JavaScript app running in a web browser, uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/exampleOfAThreadsUrl.png&quot;&gt;urls that begin with www&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024. There's no harm in it, it's just there was a consensus a long time ago that the &lt;i&gt;www&lt;/i&gt; part was not necessary.</description>

			<title>Did you forget that quickly?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We've noted this before.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Established facts about Trump eventually lose their currency, reporters forget and report it as big news next time they see it happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fealty&quot;&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; to Putin for example. How could a reporter forget that? Yet they seem to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two moments to bring you back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/trumpBowsToPutinWhoGlowsWithPride.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Picture 1.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/whatKindOfMonsterIsThis.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Picture 2.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are so many of these pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember we tried letting Trump play president, we shouldn't have survived it, and in a lot of ways we didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Collectively we're like the main character in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense&quot;&gt;The Sixth Sense&lt;/a&gt; (no spoilers, but if you have seen it you know what I mean).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So please, dear reporters and editors, try to factor actual proven facts into the context of your reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Four things about threads.net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Four things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're selling ourselves out by letting Facebook own a new social network and not putting that energy into building something that preserves our choice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I understand that Facebook's claims of supporting the Fedisphere won't amount to anything. They will end up controlling what interop means, which means we end up with yet another app store, with all the nonsense that comes with. Welcome to CyberDisneyland.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You know all this, as well as I do. But we have decided not to care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly how we snookered ourselves into using Twitter for 17 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>
