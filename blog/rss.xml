The first half is an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries&quot;&gt;Hakeem Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;, you can skip that part, pretty standard stuff. It gets interesting at 17:50 when they take calls from listeners. A lot of different points of view from people of all ages, they're incredibly passionate, well thought-out, coherent. This is way better than the punditry you hear on news. The real crime here is that the insiders of the Democratic Party are taking control, after they were manipulated by the press. A total insider's route-around of the democratic process, it's just as bad imho as what the Repubs are planning around Election Day. The press did the same thing to NY governor Andrew Cuomo, who was elected by the people, and forced out without any legal process, and certainly not a vote. That experience argues in favor of when you're in doubt, do the thing the voters said to do. Anything else is very very questionable. Why are you taking control? Where are you authorized to do that? I think perhaps some of the Dems forget how huge an issue this was in the 2016 process.</description>

			<description>Historically it's unjustifiable. The NYT et al are grievously wrong, and that should be reflected on their op-ed pages. We've been here before, this is as much a hack as Hillary's Emails. Maybe you can't see it now, but win or lose, people are going to look at this period when we all lost our minds.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2024/07/6-6/&quot;&gt;Matt says&lt;/a&gt; some interesting new stuff is coming from Automattic now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2024/07/dorsey/&quot;&gt;WordPress 6.6&lt;/a&gt; is out. Something for writers? Perhaps something that moves WordPress into a space adjacent to twitter-like systems? They just added support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; to WordPress, so now you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://jetpack.com/social/&quot;&gt;crosspost&lt;/a&gt; from a blog to a thread. Haven't tried it yet. They also have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/&quot;&gt;identity system&lt;/a&gt; built around Gravatar, announced in early June. It'll be interesting to see what they come out with. I wonder if there is a developer ecosystem building on this, and if they have an evangelism program. I have my own vision of how these things should work.</description>

			<description>I'm avoiding the actual RNC, the speakers are just actors. Trump looks like the Queens kid he is. People from Queens don't feel like we really belong, except with other Queens people. We expect to be thought of as the kid from Queens. I know this so well. So the &quot;boss&quot; slumps around not sure what to do or say. He's not gregarious. Not in charge of anything.</description>

			<description>If the world doesn't know you did something you might as well not have done it. This is what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart&lt;/a&gt; learned, and what we learned in his aftermath. He is known for inventing the mouse, because that's the one thing he invented everyone knows about. He also developed software that pioneered using a computer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Engelbart/Engelbart_AugmentIntellect.html&quot;&gt;organize your ideas&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part people don't know about that because (I guess) most people don't organize their work?</description>

			<description>The Repubs can win by throwing the election into the House. They can probably get it by the courts in enough places, just a couple of swing states, and they win even if they lose by normal vote-counting methods. The whole bit about Biden's age is meant to distract us from the fact it probably doesn't matter how old the Democratic candidate is.</description>

			<description>Highly recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81614129&quot;&gt;Netflix series&lt;/a&gt; -- esp the last three episodes. I found it enlightening, even though I lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. &quot;The end of history&quot; was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the USA, and the deep and lasting wounds we keep re-opening.</description>

I found it enlightening, even though I lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. &quot;The end of history&quot; was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the USA, and the deep and lasting wounds we keep re-opening." created="Tue, 16 Jul 2024 16:33:19 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/07/16.html#a163319"/>

He's as empty as Trump, and much younger, so we can't hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem, because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump's sons probably aren't happy about this. Had he picked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio&quot;&gt;Little Marco&lt;/a&gt;, no one would mistake him as an heir, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum&quot;&gt;Doug Burgum&lt;/a&gt; who is a bit too old to be an heir (same age as I am). We &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have a problem with Biden, he hasn't prepared for this moment. Old or not, they had 3.5 years to get ready, and they didn't. As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest most important thing is that we &lt;b&gt;organize ourselves.&lt;/b&gt; That's the best defense all around. Every attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)&quot;&gt;corral&lt;/a&gt; the insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate. Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he was getting there, but now he's back, and probably a bigger threat than ever. I don't think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need leadership. Not wait to be led. We've waited too long. People who appear ready to step up -- AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn't put Obama on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being nice, unfortunately. We're also not going to prevail by each of us taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;We. Need. To. Organize.&lt;/i&gt; Democrats should roll out new initiatives with the same skill as Apple rolls out new products. Not the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Steve+Jobs%22&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, that's asking too much. But with focus and showmanship, and a livestream, and fanbois and Al Sharpton in place of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;. Focus our attention on each product (ie climate change, social security, Ukraine, etc), so the ideas don't get missed, and we can network in support of the initiative. This is all part of the idea of having a &lt;i&gt;democratic.party&lt;/i&gt; website that we call call home for our political organizing. None of this pissing in the wind we do on twitter-like systems. Form buddy groups of people we organize with, based on locality or common interests. Organize the people as well as the billionaires are organized. This is what political parties should be in 2024 for crying out loud. We're missing the point of the mess in our politics. It's all a mess because it needs to be organized and it's not. Maybe I should take everything else off my blog now so I can use what little attention I have been able to gather here to focus on this idea.</description>

			<title>Stay sane even though the news is trying to make us crazy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should hire an intern at some J-school to keep track of all of my tweets, write them down, then translate each into a rule for what a news organization should do instead of not do. Flip the sense of the rule in other words.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we feed those rules to an AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we flow in the news stories of the day from various sites through the same AI for translation. Yes I know they'd complain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vociferous&quot;&gt;vociferously&lt;/a&gt;, but which ones you use don't matter because the AI algorithm will translate whatever they are to Dave Winer tense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then of course publish them to another site called The News That Helps Us All Stay Sane. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;BTW, I'm intermittently locked out of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; account. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png&quot;&gt;They say&lt;/a&gt; it has to do with automated stuff they don't explain. I don't have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network, it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don't see me over there, this is why.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How I found out about Trump's assassination. By accident, I was watching CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to season 6 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty&quot;&gt;Line of Duty&lt;/a&gt;, which isn't very great. I couldn't focus on the show. I got my iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; hadn't been killed, and somehow I knew that &quot;he&quot; was Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his fist, looking right into the camera. He's 100 percent television actor. Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn't cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed killing him. He's thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies about being a victim, really is a victim, and we'll never hear the end of it. And it didn't take long before a random Republican asshole was saying this was Biden's fault for saying Trump would end democracy, which he has said he will, promised to do, and &lt;i&gt;we saw him try to do it&lt;/i&gt; on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides. It didn't take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate. This was Biden's fault they all agree. Occam's Razor says this is over. We aren't going to vote in November. The deal is done because the journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I've yet to hear another explanation from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph, they'd nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That's how our journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the dictator. This is what it's like after that happened. People inside big companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize. Now their malaise becomes ours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if Biden steps aside don't expect the Repubs won't sue saying it's illegal, so guess what -- not only don't you get Biden, you don't even get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the arguments already written.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An open tweet to Keith Olbermann</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1812139277418971640&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still thinking about your last episode and how you don't know what to tell anyone to do. i think that's great. because no one knows -- in the meantime here are a couple of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;let's organize democratic voters. the better organized we are, the better we can get through the attacks from the nyt, cnn, msnbc, et al that are coming until the election. a web site for circles of friends, a buddy system that gets the word out. can use all social networks, email etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;encourage biden to take off the gloves, even more than he is. he should say the biggest problem is the supreme court. we have to fix it. make this a referendum on roe v wade and all the other stuff that's harder to explain.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ask joe to have fun. he's good when he's saying god love you and shit like that. hand out ice cream when it's hot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;level with people. biden isn't the best speech-maker and 81-year-olds can't run around like they're 50 (he's still figuring that out),  but he's a really good president. think about how it was when trump turned things over. the country was in really bad shape. he totally blew covid. that mattered. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;one more thing -- trump attacked the freaking capitol on his way out. that man has a temper and is a loser. a sore loser &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;biden has friends who help him. make the theme song for the election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C58ttB2-Qg&quot;&gt;help from my friends&lt;/a&gt; by the beatles. put the young stars of the democrats out on the road and sell them as the future that we are working on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the product isn’t just Biden, it’s a freaking goverment and social security, and owning your own body, freedom of religion, all that good american stuff. It’s the governors of pennsylvania, michigan, arizona, the senators from georgia, it’s the whole freaking thing!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;like it or not the debate &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; start the campaign. Everyone is listening to Joe Jobs now, so say things! Dont waste the attention. Never waste a good crisis someone said.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;have you ever seen a campaign speech with &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/whyVoteForBiden/&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; like a Steve Jobs keynote. Some good ideas there. &quot;One more thing.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;KO -- keep up the good work. and ad lib more. some of your writers are pretty lame. i can tell when you wrote the episode, but i like the ones where you ad lib even more.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Route around journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why journalists don’t bother trying to take Trump down, but do with the Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simple. Trump has routed around journalism as we have begged the Dems to by going direct to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The journos have no power over Trump and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They have total power over the Dems, and they know that too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If by some miracle the journos let us (voters) determine the president, we must &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; let them have this power again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had a post here about the inevitability of Biden stepping aside, then I turned on the news and saw how the press was humiliating the President at a meeting with the president of Ukraine. We can't give into this. How dare they insult the president as he represents the US in NATO. I can't get behind this. We're in a bad bad place.</description>

			<title>Nancy Pelosi</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I kind of like what Nancy Pelosi is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She's got a unique role to play, as a master of Washington and national politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and giving her blessings to how they go forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the election. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how she and Biden get along.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's much better to have her leading this discussion than the children who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they don't understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I trust Pelosi in this situation, we're lucky to have her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Resuming the Podcast0 feed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new episode for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcast0/&quot;&gt;Podcast0 feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After a break since June 20, we now resume my original &quot;audio blog&quot; from the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers -- we'll have an original audio blog post. That's when the pulse really starts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/10/upcomingEpisodes.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of upcoming episodes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;morningcoffeenotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quantum-light-breath/id1752527298?i=1000661785816&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; page for this episode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I got the title wrong, it's Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it, and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast clients, I'm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as this one is)? I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I wonder if links make it through to most clients?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; for Podcast0.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.</description>

			<title>Jon Stewart, yes you should STFU</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The problem is elites grabbing the wheel with no clue about what comes next.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/14/bidenActionFigure.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Every Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart's opening for the Daily Show on YouTube. It's always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There's never been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren't any smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that's been the real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we've gotten the tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And now we're at the last moment before it's all flushed away and the NYT et al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don't think I've ever done that in a podcast, and I'm not sure I like it. But the rage is real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/09/yesJonStewartPleaseSTFU.m4a&quot;&gt;16 minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.</description>
