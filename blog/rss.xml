I want to show people how to get a good result with WordLand, even if they have plenty of experience with WordPress, but especially if they don't. I want people to look at a user's site and think &quot;Hey I want one of those!&quot; Not too fancy, just get out of the way and let the writer's writing stand out and look great. This is a replay of the work we did on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4100j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22radio+userland%22&quot;&gt;Radio&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Everyone has to communicate in plain language, directly to the people. The courts, universities, every institution that the president is defaming. Go direct, go around the media. Start communicating in the language we communicate in these days. Use the tools. The campaign never stops. Then we'll know what we have to do to protect the rule of law. And the Dems are starting to do that, some of them, thankfully. Best example so far -- AOC and Bernie. Elizabeth Warren. Chris Murphy, Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen. And lately some Repubs too. It's the same old thing the web does -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/13/165056.html&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I like that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-federal-reserve-jerome-powell/682489/?gift=f35zZN0v_gDFE8xNwlQAHV9MKISzUu2dWhKFwtUiTHc&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&quot;&gt;Powell&lt;/a&gt; is telling Trump he won't go. I wish Obama had had the guts to say that to McConnell when he wouldn't hold hearings on Garland. &quot;Well if you won't take a vote, we'll take that as consent,&quot; says the President. &quot;And you can quote me on that.&quot; In a televised event Obama himself would walk Garland over to his office at the Supreme Court and administer the oath and let him take his seat. I don't know about you but I would have felt great about America then. We're finished being such pussycats.</description>

			<description>Watching debates on CNN it’s amazing how many arguments would be settled by saying “It’s nice you feel that way, but that’s not what the Constitution says.”</description>

Twitter was a fine start, in 2006, but today it’s clear a lot of its rules and limits were mistakes. 19 years later it’s ridiculous that Bluesky and Mastodon repeat those mistakes. I love the term he uses, the &quot;shape&quot; of Twitter. Each decision we make in developing our means of discourse &lt;i&gt;shapes&lt;/i&gt; the discourse. And with the character limit and the inability to edit, and the incentives are all wrong (I can tap into your follower flow without your permision just by posting a reply) it makes almost all twitter-like discourse spam or abusive. I'm planning a different structure for discourse in the world shaped by WordLand. A reply will only be visible to the person who you're replying to. If &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; want others to see it, they can make it public. It's their choice. So you probably should be respectful if you're looking for a flow boost. You can turn off all discourse if you want, giving the ability to finish a thought. We've learned so much about this in the 19 years since Twitter started. It's time to break out of the limits. BTW, that's what my &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; doc was all about.</description>

I have to do this if it's going to be as good a product as it possibly can. The Timeline seems really solid btw, thinking about next steps. Lots of fun products coming soon!</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/26/154836.html&quot;&gt;Join a Parade Today&lt;/a&gt;. When people talk about What You Can Do on podcasts or on TV, they say lame things that don't work that well. One thing for sure is that when Bernie and Alexandria do a rally in your area, you can go and enjoy the energy. This is a good thing because it gives the TV cameras something to focus on. But here's what I think the best thing to do is. Don't start something, join something. Because two is way more powerful than one, and three is way more powerful than two. When people work together on something good, more people doing it is usually even better.</description>

			<description>Looking for help from people who know how to create WordPress themes. The goal is to create a default theme that works well for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;-authored sites. It was suggested I try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/retrospect?tab_filter=blog&quot;&gt;Retrospect theme&lt;/a&gt;, and it does &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/15/siteshot.png&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; quite nice when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/54#issuecomment-2807218882&quot;&gt;switched over&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/04/15/this-is-not-the-america-we-grew-up-in/&quot;&gt;daveverse site&lt;/a&gt; to use it.

			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114335522071398061&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: ChatGPT is to Google what Google was to library card catalogs. The great thing about Google when it was first out was that unlike previous search products, they searched everything, including our blogs, and that opened up knowledge to us that had been previously, for all of our history as a species, not accessible. And LLMs are similarly revolutionary. I'm doing much better, deeper work, with great results for my users, than I could have accomplished with the network defined by Google.</description>

I'm doing much better, deeper work, with great results for my users, than I could have accomplished with the network defined by Google." created="Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:07:56 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/15.html#a120756"/>

			<title>What is Inbound RSS?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a complex piece here earlier, but it's much simpler than it made it sound, so I decided to start again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as outbound. Same feed, different contexts. Like trains going in and out of a station. Inbound and outbound. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But some software views RSS in both directions. The best example is Twitter and its successors such as Mastodon, Threads and Bluesky. These products are for both for reading and writing. It makes sense to have outbound feeds, like a blogging tool, and it makes just as much sense as a consumer of feeds, like a feed reader, so we can easily publish stuff from other environments and people can subscribe to them exactly as if they used their editor to write it. No reason anyone needs to know. &lt;i&gt;This is absolutely the simplest and most web-like way to do federation. &lt;/i&gt;And you don't need any new formats or protocols. It's all &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; on both sides. We totally know how to do RSS. It's ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about this a few years ago was Substack. I wanted to publish a nightly email newsletter from what I had posted that day on my blog, but I didn't have the patience to copy and paste and then reformat the text, by hand, when I already have that automated. They wanted to turn me into a computer. I tried that with Medium for a couple of years and it was awful. No thanks. What I needed them to have support Inbound RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. You now know all there is to know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Inbound%20RSS%22&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS&lt;/a&gt;. 😀 &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But until they deliver on replaceability, it's a 5-alarm fire because of what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire Twitter's user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided. And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems, starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.</description>

They're asking us to go deeper into the myth that the most toxic tech ever invented is actually good for us. The thing that feels good is the belief that it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good. In that we are just as deluded as the people who think Trump is a genius who understands business and thus will do a great job of running the world economy, a power no previous president had dared to exercise, not even sure they knew they had such power. The educational institutions that are being attacked by Trump now, should have played a role in creating effective communication systems, as should journalism. I got up on stage at a NYT event a few years back and begged them to compete with Twitter. One or two people in the audience of a few hundred were inspired by the idea, but the follow-up was nil. People are comfortable with the belief that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22baby%20squirrels%22&quot;&gt;baby squirrels&lt;/a&gt; have our interests at heart.

They're all selling us out, again, and again, and again. It's a loop they'll never get out of. I have friends scattered around the world in places of power. When are we going to work together to create the communication system we need. We're never going to get there by waiting for tech and journalism to get together on this.</description>

The only downside would be that now they really &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be replaceable. Anyway, they're partly there. Right now they support outbound RSS, and are improving it. That's the strategically easy half to do. The one that would really open them up is inbound RSS, the protocol that all the other twitter-like systems refuse to support. Want to blow the doors off now instead of some vague time in the future? Support outbound &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; inbound RSS.

			<title>We were just cogs in the machine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a special high school in NYC, it was a public school you had to take a test to get into. One day our social studies teacher got some gumption, maybe he had a few drinks, or smoked some weed, but he had courage most teachers never had. He told us who we were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of us were going to MIT or some other university that sent workers into the establishment to become cogs in the big wheel that kept the world running. He was right. Although my own path wasn’t that direct, I did get there. I rose to the top in Silicon Valley, then a big famous university. Everything Mr Goldman told us that day was true. But what he probably also saw was that he too was a cog, a tool, a piece of the machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to draw a realistic picture of that day in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970&quot;&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/12/mrGoldmanTellsTheTruth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Mr Goldman lays the hard truth on us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This morning ChatGPT told me it knows more about me, and will learn better. Promises promises. I would like to begin with teaching it my coding conventions. Will make it &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; easier for me to work with it. Their idea of how JavaScript works is disorganized bordering on chaos. I find that human developers always find a reason not to listen to other people, and that has huge problems (like no interop), but machines should do better. It seems to have infinite patience. What I need is to share a bit of space with the bot, so I can keep it up to date on my worknotes. I'm pretty good at it these days. Why not let that be input into the system so I can say -- give me all the notes I have on my Bingeworthy project. Why should I have to copy/paste. This is a big problem in the web, products that pretend to be islands, when they're really all floating on the same sea, the internet. We were supposed to be able to network not only our attention, but also our work.</description>

			<description>If I were a sassy Democratic Party leader I'd cop to being woke. &quot;Why yes I am woke. Aren't you?&quot; The Repubs have never explained why it's bad to be awake. Dems have to learn how to engage to win. Another one -- &quot;read, fire, aim&quot; is how Trump leads, just look at the tariffs, and it's been a huge disaster for hard-working American wage-earners of all generations. The &quot;all generations&quot; part opens an interesting conversation, how it isn't just old people or young people, it's also people who are working today whose earnings are being stolen, and those of us who have been working for 50 years who were paying into a fund so we could benefit when we retire. That money is coming out of your paycheck with no intention of ever paying it back. That's the Republican-run America. Not so great.</description>

			<title>The big vision behind WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that eventually WordPress will be the hub for writers the way the web itself became the the hub for apps. Initially, the web wasn’t the best place to host apps, the Mac had a much more developed set of meaningful features for app devs, and we already knew the Mac APIs where the web was strange and incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet most of the energy in AppLand quickly shifted to the web because of three advantages it had:  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone could publish for it, there was no platform vendor.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The networking model was open and simple, where the Mac's was hidden behind incomplete and poorly written docs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Mac's networking only worked on the Mac at a time when Windows was becoming dominant, and the web offered simplicity that neither platform could match.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web made writing network apps a joy, where the Mac made it a slog. No matter how much time you spent developing, it never resulted in success. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was no question for me when I saw the web, I had to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Substack and Ghost are like Mac and Windows at the dawn of the web. Their big mistake imho is they weren’t built on WordPress, which can and should imho serve as the base platform for writing on the web. If an ecosystem of writing tools is built on the Wordpress foundation how could silo’d writing tools hope to compete? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you question the choice of Wordpress, what would you go with in its place? I argue that whatever it is, it would work much like Wordpress, which has a 20+ year head start, is stable, scales, is widely supported, and open source, so if you don't like the company behind it, you can choose not to use their distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With WordLand we are testing the water hopefully proving that it is possible to create a functional writing environment on the WordPress foundation. Why is that such an advantage? Because, like the word processing products of the 80s on various OSes, these apps should be able to share data. One day you may feel like writing something with WordLand and a few days later you might want to try editing the same document using a different editing tool. As long as they both ingest and emit Markdown, they should have no trouble editing each others' documents. This is where the benefit of a common platform becomes insurmountable, because the silos insist you use their editor and only their editor and an open platform with open data formats lets you move between apps that interop. There’s a reason so many word processors thrived in the 80s, because the needs and tastes of writers vary so much, and technically it was possible to move data around in an ad hoc way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until WordLand, tools for writers on the Wordpress platform were practically nonexistent. I think that can change now, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt; that connects WordLand to Wordpress is both easy to understand, for developers, and open source under the most liberal license. Any app that connects with Wordpress through this API will interop with WordLand so totally that it could replace WordLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would be happy if WordLand played the role of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt; in the Mac ecosystem of the 80s. At the outset it was the only writing tool for the Mac, and set the usability pattern for all that followed. As a result the Mac platform, even though initially its appeal was mainly to developers and designers, quickly boomed as a writer's platform. I strongly believe Wordpress has this potential. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think writers need the same variety and open possibilities as developers, and the existing writer's systems are not offering that choice. I believe this is the start of the writers web, that should, if we do it right, and if my intuition is correct, grow like the web itself at inception. My bet is that an expansive approach will yield far more creativity in a very important area, writing, and should quickly become the place writers want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="If you question the choice of Wordpress, what would you go with in its place? I argue that whatever it is, it would work much like Wordpress, which has a 20+ year head start, is stable, scales, is widely supported, and open source, so if you don't like the company behind it, you can choose not to use their distribution." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/08/220456.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="With WordLand we are testing the water hopefully proving that it is possible to create a functional writing environment on the WordPress foundation. Why is that such an advantage? Because, like the word processing products of the 80s on various OSes, these apps should be able to share data. One day you may feel like writing something with WordLand and a few days later you might want to try editing the same document using a different editing tool. As long as they both ingest and emit Markdown, they should have no trouble editing each others' documents. This is where the benefit of a common platform becomes insurmountable, because the silos insist you use their editor and only their editor and an open platform with open data formats lets you move between apps that interop. There’s a reason so many word processors thrived in the 80s, because the needs and tastes of writers vary so much, and technically it was possible to move data around in an ad hoc way." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/08/220456.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Until WordLand, tools for writers on the Wordpress platform were practically nonexistent. I think that can change now, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt; that connects WordLand to Wordpress is both easy to understand, for developers, and open source under the most liberal license. Any app that connects with Wordpress through this API will interop with WordLand so totally that it could replace WordLand." created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:06:17 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/08/220456.html#a220617"/>
				<source:outline text="I would be happy if WordLand played the role of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt; in the Mac ecosystem of the 80s. At the outset it was the only writing tool for the Mac, and set the usability pattern for all that followed. As a result the Mac platform, even though initially its appeal was mainly to developers and designers, quickly boomed as a writer's platform. I strongly believe Wordpress has this potential." created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:06:41 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/08/220456.html#a220641"/>
				<source:outline text="I think writers need the same variety and open possibilities as developers, and the existing writer's systems are not offering that choice. I believe this is the start of the writers web, that should, if we do it right, and if my intuition is correct, grow like the web itself at inception. My bet is that an expansive approach will yield far more creativity in a very important area, writing, and should quickly become the place writers want to be." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/08/220456.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>

			<description>Rachel Maddow's show these days often begins with a hard-to-watch over-the-top endorsement of Bluesky. She shouldn't be doing that. It's a private company and someday she may criticize them as strongly as she did Facebook. I'd love to hear her explain exactly what's the difference between Bluesky and Facebook. A lot less than you might think.</description>

Anyway, the answer is yes, OPML is the native file format of &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It's the reason we chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; as the format for RSS reading lists, so we could edit them in a distant &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217&quot;&gt;ancestor&lt;/a&gt; of Drummer's whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to change file formats gratuitously -- it's how you can use different tools to edit your own data. That's a big part of the plan with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, because the internal file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it's going to be a perfect basis for interop.

			<description>I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom. What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that it isn't so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and asked it to write up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/claudewiki/&quot;&gt;proposal for ClaudeWiki&lt;/a&gt;, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run, make it part of a user's $20 per month subscription. I think it would be useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its service.</description>

			<description>I used to tell friends you can't go wrong buying the S&amp;P 500. The president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long haul you can expect steady growth from the S&amp;P 500, and it keeps things really simple. Well, have to say -- that's no longer good advice. Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don't know. It depends on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are listening.</description>
