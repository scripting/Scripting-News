			<description>I've been working, in slow mode, on a new feature for my outliners, tagging. I saw a similar idea in action with &lt;a href=&quot;https://roamresearch.com/&quot;&gt;Roam Research's&lt;/a&gt; outliner, and thought it was a really nice idea. I always want to save references to my notes in a cumulative index, like the index in the back of a book. This has always been a good companion to the fluid hierarchy, the outline structure which is more like the table of contents in front of a book. Only when you're working electronically, there isn't really a middle. Everything is in both places, at the same time. It's ideas like this that make programmers' eyes glaze over. They start using words like orthogonal, or loosely connected, and of course the always welcome &quot;distributed.&quot; Really having fun programming the last week or so. As the world is falling apart. Why not? It's not like any of us are getting out of this alive. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>White supremacy is the crisis in the US. There was confusion after 9/11 if we were at war, and now it's even more confusing. What's not confusing is that both events were Acts of War. If I were white, and I am, I'd want to have a way to clearly say I am not with them.</description>

			<title>Good morning everybody</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a weird feeling in the world right now. Tomorrow is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day&quot;&gt;national holiday&lt;/a&gt;, and Wednesday is Inauguration Day. No matter what, things will change radically in the US in the next few days.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got an answer to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/16.html#a170934&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; I asked yesterday, about who 20K+ troops in DC will report to, until Biden is sworn in. By law they report to the commander-in-chief, President Trump. Just a fact. If Trump orders them to assassinate everyone at the inauguration, it's not all that different from what Trump told the mob to do on January 6. So unfortunately it is in the realm of possibility.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It all hinges on who the troops are loyal to. Turns out the military thought of that, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2021/01/troops-inauguration-pre-screened-extremism-says-dc-guard-commander/171456/&quot;&gt;pre-screened&lt;/a&gt; the soldiers assigned to this job to weed out white supremacists. I kid you not. They know how to do that? I guess it would be naive for them not to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a nightmareish vision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat&quot;&gt;Anwar Sadat's assassination&lt;/a&gt; in 1981. If you haven't seen it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKu-u-W5J84&quot;&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;. You've never seen anything like it, even in a movie or TV show.  As they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/16.html#a170600&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, this is why you want to have programmers around, we think about these things. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read last night that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/01/pentagon-wont-throw-traditional-farewell-ceremony-trump/171408/&quot;&gt;the Pentagon turned Trump down&lt;/a&gt; for a great military send-off on Wednesday morning. Interesting, are they allowed to do that? No one seems to be questioning it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if it goes smoothly and the Bidens end up running the government on Thursday, and recinding Trump's orders, the tension goes down a lot. We still have to deal with Trump, and Republicans, but really if they could just STFU our real business is with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the usual mottos apply, Let's Have Fun, Still diggin, and It's not like anyone gets out of this alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1350480969443270656&quot;&gt;Vaccinating all Americans&lt;/a&gt; in short order is the kind of thing we're good at. While I was growing up, we went to space. I remember the Mercury and Gemini missions, and I was 14 years old when we landed on the moon. When there are catastrophes elsewhere in the world, America helps them dig out. We can do this. It will be a great thing to be reminded of our capabilities. We've spent the last four years losing. We need a win. This one is a slam dunk.</description>

			<description>I needed a script to loop over a calendar-structured folder to generate a list of the most recent updates to a set of projects that are backed up in these folders. I used Frontier. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/testing/code/listChangedProjects/script.txt&quot;&gt;script source&lt;/a&gt;. This is the kind of thing that's much quicker in a scripting system than it would be in Node or some another system language.</description>

			<description>There are 20K troops in DC. Who do they take orders from? Do they think Biden won, or it was stolen from Trump. How many of them believe in the peaceful transfer of power. The question really is, who is the individual cop or soldier loyal to. Since the Civil War, as far as I know, this has not been in question.</description>

			<description>I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/15/memoTrump.png&quot;&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; at the home page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt; this morning, wondering how journalism would adjust to not having a daily Trump story (or more) to obsess over. How will everyone else deal with that. What will Maddow talk about every night? The fear factor should diminish, one would hope. Former presidents have much less power than sitting presidents. Trump could be the exception. They will have plenty to write about. First the impeachment. The trials of the January 6 insurrectionists. Trump's trials, bankruptcy. Trump going to jail? One can hope. Will this be good for Biden? For us? I don't know. The Democrats need to get a great online organizing machine rolling, for more than raising money and getting out votes. We need to have healthy forms of political action, to balance out the evil kind, which we're seeing so much of. Say what you will about Trump, he did organize an active base. The Democrats could too, but they don't seem to know it. Same as it always was.</description>

			<description>Come to think about it, Maddow will have plenty to talk about as details of how Trump and his associates hollowed out and looted the US government while they were in office. We'll be finding smoking holes in the ground for decades to come. Things that used to work that no longer exist. So if you need a nightly story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-american-carnage.html&quot;&gt;American carnage&lt;/a&gt;, you will be well taken care of.</description>

			<description>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510771928010753&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from the Wednesday about the &quot;significant ramifications&quot; of banning Trump from Twitter. In the thread he talks about Twitter funding an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992&quot;&gt;open decentralized standard&lt;/a&gt; for social networks called Blue Sky. I remember when they announced this in 2019, I think I offered to help then, and I offered again today. Creating an open distributed system at Twitter's scale is an ambitious undertaking.</description>

			<title>Roku's UI?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think Roku is an incredible product. The remote is the best. The UI is great. On screens that integrate it, where Roku is the OS, it's even better. It's how screens should work, imho. I called it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;Entertainment Desktop&lt;/a&gt; in April 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's something I've heard a lot -- Roku's user interface &quot;needs work.&quot; Or it's old-looking, dated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I don't get it. Compared to what? It seems pretty good to me, and I've spent decades thinking about and working on interfaces for stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Remember iTunes?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Nets traded for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30706097/sources-houston-rockets-trade-james-harden-brooklyn-nets&quot;&gt;James Harden&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top stars in the NBA. They gave up most of their draft picks, so their future looks pretty grim. And they now have two of the most worst-attitude players in the NBA in Kyrie Irving and Harden. Not sure about Durant. But I wonder how many games Kyrie is going to play this year, when ball-hog Harden is on the court. Maybe he can lead the second team. Somehow the power has to gravitate away from the stars, and back to the teams. In the meantime, it's kind of a blessing for the Knicks that none of the superstars want to play there. That way every victory feels earned. The team has a spirit. Of course they have egos, but none so dominant as the ones who now play for Brooklyn. Now I just wish I could watch the Knicks for less than $65 a month, which is a ripoff that I refuse to pay.</description>

			<title>Terrorism and tech</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT needs someone who understands tech at a human level, the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; understands viruses. Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/podcasts/the-daily/capitol-attack-social-media-parler-twitter-facebook.html&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/a&gt; could have been so much better, more informative, and less scary.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The terrorists will hit some new speed bumps now that they've had some success. If their online groups follow the pattern of every group I've ever belonged to, it won't be long before they're attacking each other. Probably has already started.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just like there were defenses against the virus, which we learned about in March from McNeil, there are defenses against the terrorists, beyond deplatforming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maddow needs help too. You know how she always asks if she got it right and the other person says yes. Well, when it comes to tech, the answer is no. Her stories, when they involve tech are usually nonsense.(I say usually because I haven't heard them all.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, the app stores on Google and Apple. That's where Parler was cut off. They didn't provide back-end services, they provided distribution. Like when you buy bread at the supermarket, they didn't make the bread, but they have it all there in one place for you to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Apple and Google, they make it very hard if not impossible to install something that didn't come through their store. This is for security, and also gives them full control over the platform. So when they removed Parler, that was pretty much the end for them on mobile devices. They still had the open web until Amazon knocked them off there too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also the news is butchering the difference between Amazon and the others (Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google). They are providing something completely different. And them kicking Parler off is pretty unprecedented for them. That in itself is big news. Like the failure of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's another interesting angle that they touched on yesterday in the Daily, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming&quot;&gt;deplatforming&lt;/a&gt; has a disadvantage, it means it's harder to spy on the terrorists. Something like this happened 20 years ago with Napster. At that time everyone was getting their music from Napster. The music industry, sued them, and won, buh bye Napster. But something was lost there. The idea of a central place for music, that might have been interesting. It'll never happen again, just like we will never get the Coronavirus contained again, as it was before 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tech is interesting! But the lack of confidence among journalists not only lets people manipulate them (Hillary's emails) it often distributes information that's just plain wrong and that's too bad. Because a lot of these things aren't mysteries now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Something like this happened 20 years ago with Napster. At that time everyone was getting their music from Napster. The music industry, sued them, and won, buh bye Napster. But something was lost there. The idea of a central place for music, that might have been interesting.

			<description>Suppose for the sake of argument that the election was rigged, a conspiracy between state governments, including Republican state governments, and journalism. Do you think their coverup could be so complete we'd never have hard proof of this conspiracy? Hard to imagine intelligent people believing that it could. And BTW, don't think they're not intelligent. There were a lot of very educated and successful people who attacked the Capitol last week. What's going on inside these people? Not asking a question of people who read this blog, just expressing bewilderment. At what point will their deep gullibility lose out to their experience and bullshit detection?</description>

			<description>Repubs are objecting to being scanned for weapons going onto the House floor. Should we conclude that they have been bringing weapons onto the floor? Why else would the Capitol police want to put a scanner there? Are they afraid of a hostage situation where the perp is a member of Congress? So many questions. If in the opinion of some reps, they are entitled to bring weapons onto the floor, is there a limit? Can they bring automatic weapons? Grenades? An automatic grenade launcher? How about a tank, could they bring a tank onto the floor of the House. I suppose that could come in handy.</description>

			<description>Over the years Trump was on Twitter, I had him blocked. I urged people I follow not to RT him. That's the first and only rule of trolls, &lt;i&gt;don't feed them.&lt;/i&gt; That's what they need. His fans love that he pisses off the libtards (that's you btw). How much more effective it would have been if instead of waiting for Twitter to ban him, we all did it, by blocking him. Pay no attention. That would have been incredible. But people need to learn. Okay now it's time not to RT the Repubs as they desperately try to reboot their reality distortion field. Let Trump's base take care of them. Don't RT them. &lt;i&gt;Let them fail.&lt;/i&gt; When you feed their attempts at controversy you are, perhaps ironically, saving them.</description>

			<description>Trump doesn't need Twitter, he could just use a blog. If he did, there would be pathways for people to find out he updated, and software that would let his followers read his latest messages, in reverse chronological order. There would be no Twitter to shut him down. Now, I'm not sure where he could go to get the blog hosted. I wonder if Blogger and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/11/messageFromWordpress.png&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; et al have considered what they'd do if he started a blog in either of those places. Thing to know is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is a lot easier to deploy than a Twitter-like system, and it could be distributed. We looked at lots of those things in the heyday of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Napster%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; to route around the music industry. I hate that I'm helping Trump be the monster he is, but I feel obligated to share this with my followers, who probably want to think about real-world applications of distributed internet technology.</description>

			<description>Here's something positive. Re this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-trump-supporters-turned-one-mild-mannered-dc-lawyer-into-the-angry-guyonporch/2021/01/07/384be64c-5106-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NRKveronica/status/1347002291249770496&quot;&gt;GuyOnPorch and WomanInCar&lt;/a&gt; meme that became viral. Let me set the stage. The guy on the porch is an older white man. He's screaming obscenities at MAGAs (off-camera) telling them to get the fuck out of DC. Then the camera swings to a black woman in her car, and she's kind of astonished to see the white man saying what she was thinking. And she said so. I cried watching it. Later in the profile they said something that grabbed me. “Humphries was stunned that it was this 60-year-old White man speaking her truth. Their truth.” I wanted to give them both a big hug. We need to get our shit together. It's not just her truth and his truth, it's the truth of America. We love this country. And that means we love each other. For real.</description>

			<description>I had a post here entitled Morning Depression Notes. I deleted it. I don't need to make your day worse. But I do want to say Monday January 11, 2021 is one of the worst days ever. I somehow made it through 2020 without getting depressed. But 2021, it's a real challenge. Maybe I just want to say one thing. Let's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Participants_in_rebellion&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/a&gt; all the Republican senators, except Mitt Romney. Send them all home. They had a chance to stop this, the Dems tee'd it up for them, all they had to do was vote to convict. Sure they might have lost their jobs. They're going to lose them anyway. But they might have had a tiny little bit of residual honor, and we all could have stood up for them, when the MAGA mob comes for them. Now, let em go -- out the airlock. Good riddance.</description>

			<description>As it settles in, what Trump and his family did, what Giuliani did, there is no penalty harsh enough to fit the crime. That they still have their freedom says there’s something missing in the Constitution. That Trump still have has freedom says there’s something missing in the Constitution.</description>

			<description>They need a new rule in Congress. Don't bother electing anyone who tried to overthrow the US government. We will not let them sit down.</description>

			<description>I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;http://Fubo.tv&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt; a try, because I'd &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/28/203054.html?title=iWontAddNewSpectrumServices&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/27.html#a164205&quot;&gt;watch Knicks games&lt;/a&gt;. Well, there's a deal stopper, no CNN. The Knicks are not worth $65 a month, even if they are good this year.</description>
