Some parts are confusing, some are poorly edited. They try to have a shocker or cliff hanger at the end of episodes, but they aren't very shocking and the cliff turns out to be something so obvious that you could swear they already told us that.

The incredible shots they took, many of them were works of art all on their own. Maybe it was the combination of factors. The skill of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilligan&quot;&gt;Vince Gilligan's&lt;/a&gt; team, combined with our admiration for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn&quot;&gt;Rhea Seehorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the gravitas of Apple TV and one of the other great shows of our time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=severance&quot;&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt;. That made the conclusion obvious, by lineage this must be the &lt;i&gt;best show ever. &lt;/i&gt;It's always that way, in sports for example. You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But! I am hooked, I love the show, it's hard to imagine anything could get me to not reserve Thurs at 9PM to watch the latest episode, all I ask is no more humans eating dog food. Please, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was too much. It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</description>

Software is gradually adjusting this way, putting the AI where the problem is. For example I wanted to do a Google Form a few months ago and the best Gemini could do was tell me what commands to choose. But now if you go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.google.com/&quot;&gt;make a form&lt;/a&gt;, using the Forms app, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/06/helloDave.png&quot;&gt;offers to do it&lt;/a&gt; via AI.</description>

I just installed a version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; on that server that does a better job of figuring out if a feed item has changed. There will be fewer false positives, which makes the software considerably more efficient, and means that you don't have to see things that didn't change. It should settle down fairly quickly, but it may be a little chatty for a while. Still diggin! (Also these changes will come to feedland.com as well.)</description>

			<description>When they say AI is just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22autocomplete+on+steroids%22&quot;&gt;autocomplete on steroids&lt;/a&gt;, that's like saying a human is just a product of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur on steroids. It may be true, but it doesn't say anything useful. It's also like saying that a computer is just a collection of on and off switches.</description>

			<description>Funny thing about yesterday's Supreme Court decision, if Texas goes ahead with their gerrymandering plan, it probably will backfire on them, cause them to lose a few seats instead of gain them. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/251204/p132#a251204p132&quot;&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt; generally leave that out, probably figuring the sports fans who can understand the gambling on football and baseball couldn't understand that gerrymandering is a bet that you know which voters will turn out and who they'll vote for &lt;i&gt;a year in the future.&lt;/i&gt; In fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-allows-texas-to-use-redrawn-congressional-map-favorable-to-gop-in-2026&quot;&gt;NPR reports&lt;/a&gt; it as a victory for Repubs.

			<title>Flip switches</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In software, I like to have multiple ways to view the same data. In one context it's an outline, then flip a switch and now it's a graphic.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; shipped at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22living%20videotext%22&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac in 1986. You start with an outline and flip a switch to turn it into a tree chart. Flip it back to make a change, then flip it again to see the change in a tree chart. Or flip the outline to reveal a set of presentation slides. People loved the idea that they could create graphics entirely by writing and reorganizing and then flipping a switch. That was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application&quot;&gt;killer feature&lt;/a&gt; in the demos we did at trade shows. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/04/ucsdPascal.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Before that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=lbbs&quot;&gt;LBBS&lt;/a&gt;, a bulletin board system I wrote and ran on an Apple II in my Menlo Park living room in the early 80s, I had two views of the message structure, reverse chronologic and a hierarchic thread structure. You could always flip a switch and see the post you're looking at in the other view. If you're catching up and want to see where in the tree this message lives you, flip the switch. If you've come across a two year old post in the tree, and want to see what else was going on in 1982 (for example), flip the switch into the message scanner, and you've gone back in time. And the flip-switch was instantaneous and required one gesture, no thinking on your part. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/14/goodbyeBlueMonday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, many years later, written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/04/140651.html?title=whatFrontierIsAbout&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, started as a discussion group. It was the software behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.userland.com/msg000001.html&quot;&gt;discuss.userland.com&lt;/a&gt;, which was where the initial blogosphere formed in 1998 and 1999. Go through the archive to see for yourself. But then we had the idea that hey this could be a blog, so when you created a blog post, unwittingly behind the scenes, it just created a discussion post. So all you had to do was flip a switch when you were reading a post, and see the post in the discussion group. There's that duality again.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm working on discourse with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; in the middle, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#Directed_graph&quot;&gt;edges&lt;/a&gt;, where a comment is also a blog post. Readers might not know that they're reading something that has a dual life as a comment linked to someone else's post. There can be a flip-switch in both views that lets you go back and forth. I can only guarantee that the flip switch will be in my software, since this will be an open network, there can be any number of different ways to view the content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; famous once &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/26/letathousandflowersbloom.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Let a thousand flowers bloom.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why should comment writing not have all the features of blog post writing? Why invent a new more limited text type instead of reusing the one you created for blogging?

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories on what's actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a love story between Carol and Zosia. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; fall in love with a person with no sense of self. They plotted to have Helen killed, and waited until Carol's &quot;f*ckable&quot; judgment turns into real love. They get married and everyone lives happily ever after.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Alternate theory -- the original people are still in their bodies, suppressed to keep quiet. Inside they're screaming to be saved, as pissed off as Carol. They want their bodies back. They have the ability to write messages on their skin, so what Carol saw at the end of the last episode was a corpse with the words HELP ME! visible on the body's belly.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another alternate theory about the end of the last episode -- it took a moment for Carol to recognize her own body, possibly dead, and realizing this is all a dream. It's another version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, where this is the fake reality that we've been seeing.
