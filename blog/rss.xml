The game in Boston on Tuesday was disheartening. It's a new team with the core of last year's team. And when the fans started roaring when there was nothing happening on the court, last night at the (NY) Garden, it was because the Yankees had scored in the World Series game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Madison+Square+Garden,+New+York,+NY+10001/Dodger+Stadium,+1000+Vin+Scully+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012/@35.9504718,-117.3686049,9288091m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m16!4m15!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x33df10e49762f8e4!2m2!1d-73.9934387!2d40.7505045!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c2c6f954005675:0x9e94554f839c09df!2m2!1d-118.2399583!2d34.073851!2m1!2b1!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;2794&lt;/a&gt; miles away in Los Angeles. This is the &lt;i&gt;inconvenience&lt;/i&gt; of being a Knicks fan who hates the freaking Yankees. We have to share an NBA team. The Knicks are much more like the Mets than that other team. That's why it's so incredible to see the 2024 Knicks be able to manage both ends of the court, and completely shut down a team that last year beat them in playoffs, the Pacers, just like last year, but better.

			<description>BTW if you're thinking why don't we just go for the Nets. As I've said here many times, there aren't actually any Nets fans to speak of in NY. That was the huge self-parody &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/1365086/kevin-durants-reasoning-for-choosing-the-nets-is-the-biggest-crock-of-shit-youve-ever-heard&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; did when he claimed there was some kind of rivalry between the Nets and the Knicks. Really unfortunate unforced error he could have just asked a few people where are all the Nets fans.</description>

			<description>So when the Dodger hit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/video/freddie-freeman-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-right-field-chris-taylor-scores-to&quot;&gt;walk-off grand slam&lt;/a&gt; last night, half of me was ecstatic because the Yankees were beaten, but oops, but I hate it even more that the freaking Dodgers won. This World Series is unique in that I desperately want both teams to lose. What do you do with that??</description>

So why not keep the reporters employed, for once the seem to be doing the right thing and keeping us in the loop on why they're doing the awful thing they're doing.

			<title>Let's bust some new norms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why hasn’t the NY Times run a story that takes Trump at face value and explains to voters what it would be like to live in that United States? It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DBjMQCDsZdy&quot;&gt;An example&lt;/a&gt;. Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade should be imprisoned:  “These people should be put in jail for the way they talk about our judges and justices.” &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A news story on this subject should include calls to all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx&quot;&gt;justices&lt;/a&gt; on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've relied too much on the Democrats to stick their necks out, when in fact all our necks are on the line here. So if you have something to say about this, now is the time to do it. In a couple of weeks it might be too late. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think it's probably too late, anyway. Journalism should have reported, constantly, that the house is on fire. And nothing else. Biden's age didn't enter into it you fools. The much bigger story was and is that Hitler wants to be president, and this time he has a plan. It was true then and it's true now. The next question is what will Biden do if Trump wins. It was tough watching Obama greet Trump at the White House in 2016. I can't see Biden doing that. I wonder what ideas they're workshopping in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_Room&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; Situation Room.</description>

			<title>The million-plus Americans Trump killed</title>

Yes, a lot of them died during Biden's tenure too. But I don't think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled, first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter, then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never said geez I was wrong about this, it's a killer, and btw thanks for saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don't tell me I'm biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he's the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven't voted yet, save us from concentration camps and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration&quot;&gt;mass deportation&lt;/a&gt;. One million Americans dead is far too many, let's not try to top that. Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got a notice that Threads had deleted one of my posts because they said it violated their rules. They thought I was claiming to have written something I had not written. I didn't keep the notice (it popped up when I signed on). I shrugged it off when I got it, but then realized that we are very far away from the web. It has been turned into Disneyland where the cops are algorithms and they err on the side of stopping innocent things. I was just passing on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rohan.ga/blog/early-internet/&quot;&gt;link to someone else's blog&lt;/a&gt;, something I thought an informed person would want to know about (that's the idea behind every link I share). We really do need to dig our way out of this hole, again. This is of course no better than Twitter or Facebook. Not a place to get work done.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm continuing to develop on WordPress. I see the opportunity regardless of what else is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- and that basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don't think that's very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father's memorial site, for example. Things would have to get incomprehensibly bad for me to consider moving it and where exactly would I move it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for the writers. I think I'm pretty much alone working in this area. And maybe people need some good news? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My new product is a medium size writing tool. Less than a full word processor and more than a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt;. I think there are a lot of WordPress users who will like it. And I think there's a chance they might notice it. So I'm going all the way with this one. I may lose the bet, but wtf, let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I didn't think the Mets would make it through any of the hurdles, making the playoffs, and beating the Brewers and Phillies. That was amazing. And the energy of this team, their humor and inventiveness, professionalism and perseverance. The Mets of 2024 were a great team, and they give us something to look forward to in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say Mets pitchers walked too many Dodgers, but the walks were a result of discipline on the part of the Dodgers hitters. Most pitchers throw a lot of crap, and the hitters swing at it. The Dodgers are more discerning. If the Mets pitchers had thrown strikes they would have hit home runs. It's another way of saying that the Dodgers, no matter how much we despise them, this year at least, were the better team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there is a silver lining. I wasn't sure I wanted the Mets to beat the Dodgers once we knew the team from the &quot;other&quot; league was going to be the Jankees. Last time the Mets played them in the World Series, they beat us in Shea Stadium and as a result we had to tear it down and start over. I don't think any of us wanted that, or even to risk having to tear down Citi Field. I don't like to be reminded that the Jankees even exist, much less be forced to watch them play. And honestly between the Dodgers and the other NY team, I want them &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; to lose. Is there any way to arrange that? I don't even want to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway thanks to the Mets for being such a wonderful team, a constant inspiration. So onward. Next year. And now..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks begin their season &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/sport/basketball/article/3283231/nba-season-opens-boston-celtics-eyeing-dynasty-and-knicks-chasing-first-title-1973&quot;&gt;tomorrow night&lt;/a&gt; in Boston against the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We can use the same network, we just need a different UI for editing. Since the twitter-like systems already carry links to stories written by people on desktops, there's room in their pipes for our writing too. And it can work more efficiently if the stories are part of the message as opposed to living off-site. Think of it as a web of writing. A writer's web that also carries short messages.</description>

			<description>I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/20/warningMuskCouldPushTrumpOverTheTop.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; this morning about the reality of Musk owning Twitter, which is now completely settling in. He might have enough influence on the election to push Trump over. He wins even if Trump loses, he gets a moon mission project to boot up a Musk Party. It's coming for sure, either way. Probably will pick up what's left over after Trump, who clearly is losing it, and even if he's president, someone else will be pulling the strings. I can't imagine the billionaire will let JD Vance do it. And by &quot;billionaire&quot; I mean Musk.</description>

			<description>A second elimination game for the Mets tonight. I almost don't want the Mets to win, because the World Series opponent from the &quot;other&quot; league are the Janks from the Bronx. I love the Bronx. That's about all I have to say about that at this time.</description>

			<description>It's possible the Dodgers let the Mets win as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/18.html#a144749&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to yesterday, but it's also possible the Mets just &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/live/dodgers-vs-mets-new-york-bats-come-alive-in-game-5-sending-series-back-to-los-angeles-201027428.html&quot;&gt;crushed&lt;/a&gt; the Dodgers, but either way, the Mets are still in it. The series is now 3-2, and returns to Los Angeles tomorrow. So we don't have to tear down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field&quot;&gt;Citi Field&lt;/a&gt; after all. If the Dodgers win it'll be in their own stadium. The Mets were magnificent! Absolutely inspiring. A three-run home run by Alonso started things off. Everyone got on base. Doubles and triples. It wasn't without the concern that our wonderful and lovable Mets would do the usual Mets thing and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they held out. The final score was 12-6. We're still in it. Lets go Mets!</description>

			<description>Bloggers, here's an idea. When you write a piece you're proud of, end it with a sentence like this: &quot;And that's why I have a blog.&quot; It plants a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We've had a lot of mud slung at us, let's start undoing that.</description>

It was a sad sight. One to forget as soon as possible. And don't forget folks, there's always next year. If I were the Dodgers, I'd expect the Mets to win tonight, and the Dodgers will probably begrudgingly go along with it. Otherwise we'd have to destroy Citi Field as we did when the Yankees celebrated their World Series victory in 2000 on the field of Shea Stadium. I was actual there the night that will live in infamy. Back then at first I objected to the destruction of our shrine to the glory of past Mets teams, but then I realized we could never again rise to the peak of Mets philosophy in a chapel so soiled by the infidels.

It was a sad sight. One to forget as soon as possible. And don't forget folks, there's always next year. If I were the Dodgers, I'd expect the Mets to win tonight, and the Dodgers will probably begrudgingly go along with it. Otherwise we'd have to destroy Citi Field as we did when the Yankees celebrated their World Series victory in 2000 on the field of Shea Stadium. I was actual there the night that will live in infamy. Back then at first I objected to the destruction of our shrine to the glory of past Mets teams, but then I realized we could never again rise to the peak of Mets philosophy in a chapel so soiled by the infidels. So if you don't mind Dodgers, we'd like to keep Citi Field, so we won't object if you let our Metsies win tonight's game.

			<description>There's this great story in the Fargo TV series where one of the villains says there's a point when an animal that has been captured, relaxes when it realizes that it is no longer a being and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1msLSfeSc&amp;t=25s&quot;&gt;has become food&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;At some level food it knows it's food.&quot; Evolution has been kind to us that way. At what point in last night's game did you realize that the Mets were no longer a baseball team and had become food?</description>

And the most important thing -- they don't break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly. It means it's safe to develop here. It means there's discipline in their development organization. Most companies don't do this, but the ones who do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft's sins, they were incredibly good at this too. It's why I liked working with them, and also why we laughed at each others' jokes if you can believe that. In some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the concept of &quot;development org&quot; -- so I look at it that way. I dig around their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it'll work out pretty well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they're going to break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and completeness. They didn't rush off to the next thing before finishing. I found that in their Calypso API, which I've been building on. Honestly this is my kind of platform, it's what Manila's API would look like today probably if we had continued developing it. I'll see if I can find the docs around here somewhere. Long time ago. ;-)</description>

It should be as easy as reading a file. Give it the URL of a feed, get back a JavaScript object that's as simple as feeds are. It can read RSS, Atom and RDF feeds, but you get the same object regardless of what form the feed was in. I'm up for creating some example apps if you're interested. There is a very simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/example&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt; included in the package and a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos&quot;&gt;demo apps&lt;/a&gt;. It's MIT-licensed, so you can do whatever you want with the code. It would lovely to see it ported. The idea is to plant some seeds in the Node.js world to make it easy for developers to try out new ideas with feeds, figuring the easier it is, the more people will do it. Be creative. Blow our minds! :-)</description>

Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I'd say no. In 2003, I compiled a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/&quot;&gt;things that make a blog a blog&lt;/a&gt;, and it's not about the software you use, rather it's about who's writing it, and whether they're being edited. Now it's a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not. Because it forces you to use their editor. And that's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious&quot;&gt;pernicious&lt;/a&gt; form of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can't easily try out something new. You are not available to other software developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you. I know how well that kind of system works. And that's probably why they lock you into using their editor. If I can't switch without breaking everything, I'm not going there.</description>

It could both save and kill us. That's what's so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people aren't really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it might also kill you because you can't go back to being the person you were before. There might not be a path back. One thing's for sure we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; saving. We can't survive without radical change. We're on a path that doesn't work. Is there any way for us to change radically without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up control. But here's the funny thing about that. We aren't giving up anything because no one has any control. That's a political question in the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control. But he's 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could configure AI so it did what humans can't and won't do, at least our civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which is why I have a blog.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This morning I wrote about why I don't believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets pitcher Tug McGraw. It's on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter how it turns out I won't love the Mets any less if they lose. I think true believers believe in that -- love -- without any expectations, win or lose, or maybe &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering of the post isn't complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I'm working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I'm glad to see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in the things I believe in, not because I &quot;gotta.&quot; I don't like the slogan because it doesn't reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand that their fans don't love them any less because they lost. If anything I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wait+till+next+year!&quot;&gt;Wait till next year!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Anyway, the Yankees may win the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2024_ALCS.shtml&quot;&gt;ALCS&lt;/a&gt;, but what does it mean? It's not going to make New York love them. But then Gruber is in Philadelphia so why isn't he thinking about the Phillies, who btw, the Mets beat soundly in the division series, earlier this month. In any case, I have made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/16/mets1969TeamPicture.png&quot;&gt;team picture&lt;/a&gt; of the 1969 world champion Mets as the banner image on Scripting News for now and into the forseeable future.</description>

			<title>What's up with WordPress?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I ran a free service &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/faq&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+weblogs.com&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; didn't exist yet, so there was no way to find out which blogs had new stuff other than going through your blogroll and clicking links. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I built a simple server, running in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, that handled pings. When you updated your blog, you'd send a message to weblogs.com saying your blog updated. It would then read the HTML of the blog and verify that it changed, and it would be added to a list of blogs that updated, in reverse chronologic order. It also published an XML version of the update list called &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/changesXml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt;, so if you wanted to run a search engine off the list, you could do that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were several ways to send a ping. You could go to a web page and enter the URL of your blog. Or you could save the URL as a bookmark and click the bookmark when you updated. Or if you used blogging software like our Manila or Radio UserLand, or later EditThisPage.com or weblogs.com (which eventually hosted blogs itself), it could ping on your behalf, automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Aside: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/historyOfWeblogs&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the weblogs.com site, preserved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A number of search sites appeared. And we were happy, until another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt;, funded by venture capitalists, who expected a return on their investment, built on our open and free &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt; list, started asking for and receiving pings on their own, and (key point) they didn't make their change list public. This struck me as highly un-weblike and unfair, but they could do it and we had to live with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Based on what Matt has been saying it sounds to me like it's something like our experience. Except weblogs.com was a short term thing, and not a business, and it didn't last twenty years, and it didn't have a payroll to support. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it still felt wrong that they weren't giving back as they received. If it had persisted like WordPress has, it would have eventually been a seriously diseconomic and unsustainable problem. And I can imagine I might write about it publicly as Matt has  and maybe even get a famous lawyer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal&quot;&gt;Neal Katyal&lt;/a&gt; to advise me. And here we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have we heard anything from the other side, or anyone who is familiar with what their position might be. Do they not feel obligated to support the continued development of WordPress or maybe there's another issue we haven't heard about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine that Matt would make such a big deal out of this if it weren't actually a big deal. He probably knew in advance how disruptive this would be. And I imagine the others knew it would be too and counted on him not wanting to make a fuss. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have gotten embroiled in these kinds of things in the past, and I don't like it. I love to make software and make users happy and then make more software, round and round. Anything that involves lawyers is not me doing what I was made to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I do see a silver lining. As with twitter-like systems, I now see the possibilty to help WordPress serve writers better in the future. Before this, people didn't think change was possible in the WordPress world, like they didn't see the possibility of change with Twitter. But now Twitter has quite a bit of viable competition. I know that WordPress could be better tuned for writers, and the product has a very nice API that would make it possible for lots of writing tools to flourish. It is a strong platform that's debugged, scaled, documented and worked on for a long time, and they don't tend to break users. And where commercial vendors like Facebook and Twitter often have excellent technology, ultimately they are run by execs and bankers who don't believe in being open, where this is something that has been deeply ingrained in the WordPress culture from the beginning and would be hard to change and that's a good thing for users and developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the exciting part -- between WordPress and Twitter lies a product that would bring the web back to life. Imagine a twitter-like system with the writers features of WordPress. Amazingly, we are on the cusp of that being a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's lots of opportunity to better serve writers here, and that's what I love to do, and honestly I think Ghost and Substack have left themselves open to a writing environment built on WordPress that doesn't try to lock users in. And at the same time, I think we can use this platform to help all the twitter-like services to support all kinds of writing, not just severely limited tweets typed into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong idea that taking features out of the web was a good thing. I want to bring these features back so we can get going again with the web as a writer's platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don't need to think anyone is right or wrong here, and I don't think anyone else should either. I think this platform is very nicely open and we can do lots of interesting new stuff here. I hope to open a new thread here, focused on writers and the web. It's been too long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've seen video of a recent press interview where Trump said he's use the military to arrest and in some cases kill Americans, starting with but not limited to Hispanics. This is not being reported in the major news orgs. We can't wait for them to fix it, we have to create new channels for news flow that have credibility and work, and we need it before the election. People need at least have a &lt;i&gt;chance&lt;/i&gt; of understanding what they are voting for.</description>

I predict I'd watch far more stuff on Netflix than I do now. Or Apple TV, Max, Hulu, Disney, etc. The idea that such a valuable resource is not part of the user experience is crazy imho. What a waste. What reminded me of this is Plex has integrated the equivalent of Bingeworthy in their service, which is also a good idea and will glue communities of users to you. The idea is to systematize recommendations. If I know a specific friend liked a movie or a show is valuable information for me, not just advertisers.</description>

			<description>I am totally having a blast with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;hybrid blog&lt;/a&gt;, built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; WordPress and Mastodon. Just wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113300248202418805&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the day the NYT signs off, finally realizing how fcuked we are if Trump is elected or manages to steal the election next month. Their final headline in this story is &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.9em&quot;&gt;GOOD LUCK AMERICA&lt;/span&gt;.</description>
