			<description>Yes we're having an eclipse next week. Earthquakes often find other kinds of energy to feed on, like the one during Game 2 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Bridge_Series&quot;&gt;Bay Bridge series&lt;/a&gt; between the As and Giants in 1989. The Bay Area doesn't really get baseball. You have to pick sides. You can't root for both teams. So an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_World_Series#The_Loma_Prieta_earthquake&quot;&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; knocked out the Bay Bridge and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html&quot;&gt;screwed up&lt;/a&gt; the Bay Area for quite some time to come.</description>

It wasn't very long, but it had a real jolt. Scared the shit out of me. I'm still very sensitive to this kind of disaster.</description>

			<description>Perhaps Twitter will be like Algol, as in there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/e9f639b0-7cd0-481c-861e-0a43e0cdff97&quot;&gt;algol-like&lt;/a&gt; languages, of which one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL&quot;&gt;Algol&lt;/a&gt; itself. There will be a mass of twitter-like systems, of which X is one. They really should have tried to keep ownership of the trademark, another one of Musk's &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2024/04/elon-musk-blue-checks-x-twitter-badge-of-shame.html&quot;&gt;mistakes&lt;/a&gt; he's about to realize he made. Twitter really is on its way to achieving its destiny as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html&quot;&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>When I can't quickly find a good definitive page on Google for a concept, I ask ChatGPT to explain it, and if they got it right, I spawn a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/e9f639b0-7cd0-481c-861e-0a43e0cdff97&quot;&gt;new page&lt;/a&gt; with their explanation.

			<title>One thing Twitter is good for</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/30/twitterBirdOnGunTarget.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;One thing Twitter is good for â€” getting support from your cable ISP. Spectrumâ€™s other ways of providing support are designed to get you to give up without using too much of their employees' time. On Twitter, they pretty much always stay with it to resolution. And on Twitter, they have real people who have access to network tools, so they can see the problem from their end, and can give you a clue of what if anything you can do to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty good at bug reports, and that appears to work with the online support people they have on Twitter. If you try to chat with them or call them on the phone they read from a script which has you completely tear down and rebuild your system before they'll consider thinking about the data you have. And all this after keeping you on hold listening to their insidious advertising for 15 or more minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think the other twitter-like systems have any critical mass with support people from ISPs. Not like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, support is one place ChatGPT would excel, btw. All kinds. And I don't think too many people will lose their jobs, because their support systems are so bad because they don't hire enough people, or give them enough time with customers, or training, to actually help them very much. I know how to completely tear down the network without them instructing me how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Understanding AP and RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What does ActivityPub does that RSS doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, it's not the ability to syndicate, RSS already does that. I can follow anyone on any server. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it's the timeline? And the ability to delete posts. Keeping all that in sync is a lot of work, and presumably a lot of traffic? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also replies. If I reply to a post when viewing it on another server, the reply should show up under any other view of that post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What else??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Only thinking about features that are used by Mastodon to federate, not potential future features. If that were the rule, then RSS could do anything AP could do, right -- because you can always add the feature. So, just the features that are in use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I posted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112213481032208332&quot;&gt;on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; and may post it elsewhere, if I do I'll link them in here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Twitter is the place old friends who haven't heard they should find a new home are still posting. There are quite a few of them. Fact. It's kind of like what Facebook has become. There are a set of people I expect to see there regularly, and that's why I keep going back. Again, fact.</description>

			<title>I want all the information</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I want all the information about the products I make to be instantly available to anyone who wants to know, in exactly the form they want it. Until ChatGPT, that was a totally unattainable dream. But now, for many topics, it's reality. For example, if I have a question about CSS, and believe me, I do -- if I can ask the question clearly enough, I can get a clear and complete explanation of why the browser did the crazy thing with layout that it did. It means I could do something beautiful and refined like the blogroll I worked on in February and March, and the UI stuff I'm working on in March and April. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't wait until ChatGPT can answer all those questions about my stuff. But then people who make music don't want their songs to be available the same way. As someone who wants to know as much as possible about songs I have always loved but had no idea how they were made, or what they meant to the writer, knowledge about the work is equally valuable as understanding technical topics. I think the big difference is knowing that life is short, and if we want to leave something behind of ourselves, having the information be available is a blessing, not something to fight against. I don't see why software designers in the future should have to reinvent what my generation has already figured out. I don't want them to have to. It keeps coming back to this one idea -- to solve the problems we have as a species we're going to have to &lt;i&gt;work together, &lt;/i&gt;and part of that means not being so guarded and selfish about sharing what we've learned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had this problem with music before, with Napster. The users of music, such as myself, found that the ability to program our own music was so liberating. To listen to a song a few times before moving on made a huge difference, or to choose a song to hear because we just thought of it for the first time in 30 years. But we were literally mocked by music promoters and artists. But ultimately, like it or not, the users got the power they wanted. It's got to happen that way too for ChatGPT et al. I guess some people must've felt that search engines were going to rob creative people of control of their creations. I guess this is something we always have to go through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Blogroll software update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/01/appleRunner.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;We're starting to test the blogroll software with a few users, but we hit a problem before we began. The blogroll code includes the CSS for the Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a localized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/a&gt; of Bootstrap's styles, to be a better guest in other people's pages. That is now done. I expect we'll see more of that kind of thing. Web plugins are a new area for me. I guess that's pretty obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>After a couple of tests, the fix below is implemented here. For some reason I wasn't subscribed to my own feed, which accounted for the fact that updates from this blog weren't getting into the blogroll. That troubles me, I have to try to piece together how that happened. In the meantime it's nice to have the instant updating working again. I didn't know that I had missed it, but I did.</description>

Probably the sexiest feature in the whole thing. The bug was introduced on March 21, so it's been there a while. You have to hard-reload the page to get the new version. So, when I post this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, it should move to the top of the list immediately. So a good use-case is to leave Scripting News open with the blogroll visible and every once in a while you may find something interesting to read. I like having it there, but of course, it's my baby, so that's understandable. :-)</description>

			<description>I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to one of Kara Swisher's interviews for her new book. The interviewer was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods weren't fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another podcast. She's got a great business model. Tell the press what they want to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.</description>

If you want to read the month in outline form, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drummer.land/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml&quot;&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; and it will open read-only in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. That's a pretty good approximation of how I edit it, except I use the desktop version of Drummer that writes files to the local Mac filesystem as well as to the cloud.</description>

			<source:outline text="Started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/01/scriptingOutlineScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;new outline&lt;/a&gt; for the month of April, with March &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml&quot;&gt;safely archived&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. If you want to read the month in outline form, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drummer.land/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml&quot;&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; and it will open read-only in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. That's a pretty good approximation of how I edit it, except I use the desktop version of Drummer that writes files to the local Mac filesystem as well as to the cloud." created="Mon, 01 Apr 2024 13:32:04 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/04/01.html#a133204"/>
