			<description>The blogroll is a lot like weblogs.com combined with its successor my.userland.com. All this happened first in 1999. Today's blogroll is far in advance technically from the blogrolls of 25 years ago.</description>

			<description>When I was growing up they taught us that humans were the only animals that were conscious. They wasn't any scientific evidence of this, we know now, because it obviously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@theheralddiary/post/C4iTyzBMATf&quot;&gt;isn't true&lt;/a&gt;. And to my own credit, I was sure it was bullshit when I was a kid.</description>

			<description>Finally seeing a real blogroll bug. We're getting notified that feeds are updating that we aren't following, yet they're showing up in my blogroll anyway. Either have to add some code or look for a bug. Good thing I've got the only really deployed blogroll now.</description>

			<description>This is a nit, but it bugs me anyway. I'd love to know why Threads, which in every way is a modern JavaScript app running in a web browser, uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/exampleOfAThreadsUrl.png&quot;&gt;urls that begin with www&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024. There's no harm in it, it's just there was a consensus a long time ago that the &lt;i&gt;www&lt;/i&gt; part was not necessary.</description>

			<title>Did you forget that quickly?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We've noted this before.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Established facts about Trump eventually lose their currency, reporters forget and report it as big news next time they see it happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fealty&quot;&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; to Putin for example. How could a reporter forget that? Yet they seem to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two moments to bring you back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/trumpBowsToPutinWhoGlowsWithPride.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Picture 1.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/15/whatKindOfMonsterIsThis.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Picture 2.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are so many of these pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember we tried letting Trump play president, we shouldn't have survived it, and in a lot of ways we didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Collectively we're like the main character in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense&quot;&gt;The Sixth Sense&lt;/a&gt; (no spoilers, but if you have seen it you know what I mean).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So please, dear reporters and editors, try to factor actual proven facts into the context of your reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Four things about threads.net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Four things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're selling ourselves out by letting Facebook own a new social network and not putting that energy into building something that preserves our choice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I understand that Facebook's claims of supporting the Fedisphere won't amount to anything. They will end up controlling what interop means, which means we end up with yet another app store, with all the nonsense that comes with. Welcome to CyberDisneyland.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You know all this, as well as I do. But we have decided not to care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is exactly how we snookered ourselves into using Twitter for 17 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

For some reason it can't spell anything right, and when I asked it to correct the spelling it mocked me. But I loved the design. It understood the hard part of what I was asking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks have been slumping since two of their top players have been out with injuries for over a month, after having an amazing January. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; of the two star players came back last night, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39718456/og-anunoby-lifts-knicks-blowout-win-76ers-return&quot;&gt;what a difference&lt;/a&gt;! They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson&quot;&gt;one player&lt;/a&gt;, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab&quot;&gt;second injured player&lt;/a&gt; comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html&quot;&gt;MacWrite and MacPaint&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.</description>

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html&quot;&gt;MacWrite and MacPaint&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company.

			<description>We need a protocol for embedding a tweet in a web page. We used to have one with Twitter, but it now works only intermittently. Mastodon has one, and I have been able to use it. But really it would be nice to have a sort of jQuery of this stuff. If they're all going to create their own APIs we obviously need a container for that so developers don't have to worry about all of it.</description>

It totally could work, some person, company, foundation or whatever could build software that acts as a simplifier. Have you ever used plex.tv? Somehow they manage to do it.

			<title>AI and the NYT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Zach Seward, a friend from my days at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/about/&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; and NYU, got a kickass &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/&quot;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt;, starting up the AI effort at the NYT.  He's just the right guy for it. Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong startup journalism background. I couldn't think of anyone I'd want more to be in this position. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that he's published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; for a talk he gave at SXSW, it's time to share some ideas I have for the NYT re AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn't do. Not sure why. I'd like to be able to connect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;ai.nytimes.com&lt;/a&gt; and ask it to give me a rundown on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615&quot;&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; who's testifying in Congress today about how our president is &quot;elderly.&quot; I don't want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that answers the questions I have about the MAGA lawyer. Maybe the AI will just give me the story without the spin. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library&quot;&gt;big library&lt;/a&gt; in Jamaica (Queens)  going back through microfilm of the NYT from before I was born. So far all we've done is replicate the microfilm user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source material, used to answer very specific questions. Answer questions like &quot;has anything notorious happened in the neighborhood I grew up in, as far as the NYT knows?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians, journalists and others to study in the future, and, in the context of AI, feed it all kinds of perspective on the time we live in. Maybe in the future history won't be written by the winners (lotsa luck with that). Anyway, if at some point the NYT and other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and intelligence of the readers, why not start now? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; I care. When I stop criticizing you'll know that I've given up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alan Kay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707961&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of the Mac, it's the first personal computer worth criticizing.

			<description>Journalism talks about Trump's trials, but they are trials for the Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call&quot;&gt;he is&lt;/a&gt;) then if he isn't punished we no longer have the rule of law. So don't miss that we are on trial too. And -- when journalism frames the faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</description>

			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; was a repeat of Saturday's. The reason was the switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time&quot;&gt;Daylight Savings Time&lt;/a&gt;. This happens every year. The fix is to edit stats.json in the mail sender app's folder, and change &lt;code&gt;whenLastUpdate&lt;/code&gt; to the day before, save it, and restart the sender app. It immediately sends out the correct email. I put this note here so I might find it next time it happens and I forget how to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I put this note here so I might find it next time it happens and I forget how to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 11 Mar 2024 12:11:16 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/11.html#a121116"/>

			<title>Oh servers!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then this happened...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been having serious problems on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt; since Friday when I made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you'd get an awful error message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors. And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they still haven't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we're going to upgrade the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That won't happen today and probably not tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people probably don't know that feedland.com is a project I'm doing with Automattic. It's running in their cloud. This system should be able to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can't, where feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are many thousands of users, we should be okay. That's why I did the work to convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but it had to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on our main server in the last few days. I can't promise it won't happen again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases re-learned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's even worse than it appears and as they say -- still diggin! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The same data. There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; advantages to doing it that way. For some people that is what news.scripting.com will turn into. It's an on ramp to the world of collaborative feed subscriptions. The open social web, in feeds. Which is why we call it Feed&lt;i&gt;Land. &lt;/i&gt;You know The Land of Feeds. I like &quot;land&quot; names for products and companies. I started a company called UserLand a long time ago. I was skiing in Utah in 1989 when I decided on two names: UserLand and Frontier. I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from the Mac -- where the &lt;i&gt;Finder&lt;/i&gt; is the app you spend a lot of time in. So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and began with F. I know it's weird. It's also why FeedLand feels like a homey name to me. :-)</description>

			<description>Good morning. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest3/&quot;&gt;next tabs test&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday's test showed that tabs that switching between images is fine. The tabs never get hung up. Today's test is the same except one of the tabs is a FeedLand timeline. I want to see if somehow click events are getting lost on their way to the tabs manager.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest/&quot;&gt;next test&lt;/a&gt; for finding the conflict in my tabs code. I'm trying to isolate a problem with the tabs code I use in my blog, and in various pieces of software. Late last year, I decided to stop making new tabs systems, and to invest in a single great tabs manager. This app tests only that code. So I want to know if this works. I may add another test after a while, based on the results of this test.</description>

			<description>I got a text message from an unidentified person saying they were coming to SF soon for some event so now we could go for a nice walk on the beach. At first I wondered who this could be. I have a 415 number, but I live far away from Calif. My first thought this was a friend who didn't know I moved (in 2009 btw, must not be someone very in touch). Of course it's just phishing. D'oh. It's clever. I guess. I guess it isn't really that smart to send a message to a random 415 number and assume the person might live in the Bay Area.</description>

Please report result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/287#issuecomment-1986089776&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Say what kind of device you were using.

Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/tabsmanager2/testing/?title=tabletTest&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. Click on each of the tabs. Do the clicks always work? Or do you have to click several times to get anything to happen. There is no good or bad answer. It's just a test. Please report result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/287#issuecomment-1986089776&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Say what kind of device you were using.

			<description>There's a problem on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; home page. On a mobile device, sometimes you have to click several times on a tab to get it to switch. It doesn't seem to happen in desktop browsers. Yesterday I finally got it to reproduce on my own machine, when emulating an iPad Mini in Chrome on my desktop. I added debugging code and set breakpoints, and had a theory that tooltips were interfering, which turned out not to be the case, but now that I can reproduce it here, I really want to get this solved. If you have development experience, or just like a good technical puzzle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/287#issuecomment-1983757115&quot;&gt;here's the thread&lt;/a&gt;. Help much appreciated.</description>
