			<title>I'd pay $10K up front</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1724632370442391861&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Sales of the 100-year plan so far: 0. Hundreds of people filled out the form, though. I think we really messed something up in the follow-up, including not making it self-serve to start. Will review and try again. It's an important promise to us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm very much a customer for this service. It would be worth $10K for to buy 100 years of persistence for my web writing. A simple easy to understand service that helps get the process started. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I transfer &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; to Automattic as registrar. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I upload the contents from S3 to Automattic server. Static files, HTML, feeds, images, code. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Automattic provides an API to keep the files updated and so I can add to them as long as I'm still writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The files are publicly accessible over HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Automattic agrees to renew the domain for 100 years, and manage access to the files, with reasonable limits and acts of god accounted for, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I pay you $10K on signing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why should you do it -- simple, easy benefit, i think you'd sell a lot of contracts, and you could start the business now, and get started serving customers and learning what they want, how they work, and get ideas for where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-11-19&quot;&gt;Brilliant post&lt;/a&gt; about RSS from Colin Walker. I agree with all of it. When a protocol or format is much more complicated that it needs to be, there's usually a reason, the proponents want to say they're compatible and open without having actual &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, I read in a news article the other day that I developed iPodder, the first podcasting client in 2004. This is not true. The first podcasting client was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. I did not write &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_(aggregator)&quot;&gt;iPodder&lt;/a&gt;, it was a community effort.</description>

Not just impressive tech, which it certainly is, but how incredibly useful it is. And how it understands my questions. And its infinite patience and good manners. I'm not trying to change Jeff's mind, but just to say I think my friend got this one wrong.</description>

This was thought to have been a failure as journalism focused on abusive social media systems. But that's where the second miracle, AI, got all its info from.

Also it turns out a number of established feed readers already do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278&quot;&gt;right thing&lt;/a&gt; with image enclosures. So that nails it, this is the way to do it. Support in FeedLand will be added shortly.</description>

The consensus seems to be that we should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt; element, as with podcasting. In this case, if the type begins with &quot;image/&quot; then an &lt;i&gt;artcast&lt;/i&gt; viewer should handle it, and others should ignore it.

Here's the artcasting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/artfeed.xml&quot;&gt;test feed&lt;/a&gt;. Try subscribing to it in a feed reader you like.

			<description>I think a basic hookup to a chatbot is going to become part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec pretty quickly. So far the best one I've seen is Guy Kawasaki's. I want to be able to ask for a list of things I've written on a given topic, and to be able to ask the questions in the same straightforward way I ask ChatGPT.</description>

			<title>My gravestone visualized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love that ChatGPT makes it possible to create visualizations for ideas that previously I could only present in words. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, I like to say that when I die my gravestone should say &lt;i&gt;He's Done Digging&lt;/i&gt; or something like that, to stand in contrast to my long-lived motto -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/03/150022.html&quot;&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/a&gt; I did some writing this morning about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Future-Safe+Archives&quot;&gt;Future-Safe Archives&lt;/a&gt;, and thought to get that as a picture. The piece isn't ready to publish yet, but no reason not to share the illustration. So here it is.. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/15/headstone.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Uncle Davy, no longer diggin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: No need for an actual gravestone. Online is fine. Hopefully we'll figure out how to make such things persist before it's needed. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>You know I don't always like the same soda. Sometimes it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/diet-coke&quot;&gt;Diet Coke&lt;/a&gt;, and other times, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drpepper.com/s/products/diet-dr-pepper&quot;&gt;Diet Dr Pepper&lt;/a&gt;. But for the last year or so the drink of choice around these parts is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/fresca-sparking-soda&quot;&gt;Fresca&lt;/a&gt;. But you know what's funny. No matter what my favored drink is, it's always the one you can't get at the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://stores.hannaford.com/ny/west-hurley/8444&quot;&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt;. Always sold out.

			<description>Someday an author is going to construct a universe in a LLM and let users interact with it. That sounds boring, but here's the interesting idea that led to it. Yesterday I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/11/013609.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT to draw&lt;/a&gt; me a image of an ancient band performing in the desert with cacti as the audience. Then this morning I had the idea of moving the concert into the pond behind my house, except this time &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/12/concertInThePond.png&quot;&gt;the audience are frogs&lt;/a&gt;. I have a private Facebook group where I tell the story of the pond, including the animals who come to visit. Some of them I invent, they don't actually exist. And they have relationships with each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and relationships. And other people's models could incorporate mine. This was an idea I had for SimCity, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+world+outline&quot;&gt;web of outlines&lt;/a&gt;, neither of which happened. Maybe it'll happen in LLM-land.</description>

			<description>The great thing about the private Facebook group is I have invited friends from all stages of my life. People I knew in from high school, New Orleans, Madison, Palo Alto, Cambridge and Berkeley, NYC and Woodstock. Even people I knew as a child. People I only or mostly know virtually. Imho, people who won't use Facebook miss out. Its greatest feature are the people who use it. It's the kind of village we yearn for, at a DNA level. People you will never stop loving. I don't think I've ever mentioned this group on the blog, but maybe I should do that more, because it's a uniquely civilized, friendly and soul-nourishing online place, at least for me.</description>

We first look for feeds that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://dri.es/rss-auto-discovery&quot;&gt;linked into&lt;/a&gt; the HTML source code. If we don't find a working feed there, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/demos/feedhunter/feedhunter.js#L56&quot;&gt;look in 27 common locations&lt;/a&gt; where feeds are often found. And btw, there's a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; that uses this package, so we do better at finding feeds. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieblog.page/&quot;&gt;Indieblog&lt;/a&gt; site which keeps a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieblog.page/export&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of blogs with feeds. We used that info to come up with our list of default locations. We also used the list of feeds people have subscribed to in FeedLand.</description>

			<description>The thing people don't like about AI isn't that the machines are trying to be human, rather it's that you could be a machine.</description>

			<description>I wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; tried to do a deal with ChatGPT to flow human knowledge through their database. Or were they caught as flat-footed as  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica&quot;&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/a&gt; was by Wikipedia, or how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera#Types_of_digital_cameras&quot;&gt;digital cameras&lt;/a&gt; were obsoleted by smart phones. Was there anything any of them could do, or was there no possible corner-turn? Also newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising&quot;&gt;classified ads&lt;/a&gt; and Craigslist.</description>

			<description>I asked DALL-E to help create an icon for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;Feed Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. I can't imagine an art director at an agency not using AI to play around with ideas for logos, symbols, ads, whatever. What I arrived at was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/09/feedHunterIcon.png&quot;&gt;tennis racket&lt;/a&gt; trying to hit a cheeseburger. I didn't end up using it, but the exploration was useful. I think this process still has quite a ways to go, I find it difficult to control the bot, I give it explicit instructions sometimes that it apparently doesn't understand. But it's still a miracle of technology. And a miracle for this human, because I've found an artist that is infinitely patient with me, and works for $20 a month.</description>
