			<description>More Succession. People wonder how can they like a show where everyone is ugly. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that the main character of the show isn't human -- it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0WzqanwlG0&quot;&gt;The Song&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it's just a 4-season-long music video.</description>

			<description>Did you know that you can get Alexa to play the Succession theme song. On the Studio player it's magnificent. Now you can have it be the theme song for your great accomplishments. Get an elegant bit of code running? Fire it up! You're the boss. You did it.</description>

			<description>Newsletter apps have had their moment, now WordPress has one, and wonderfully it has inadvertently plied open the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/30/173742.html?title=substackLockin&quot;&gt;lock-in&lt;/a&gt; that Substack imposes, by making everyone use their editor. WordPress has a time-tested API, so I could theoretically write my newsletters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and push them up to WordPress which would then send them out.</description>

			<title>I was a skeptic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was a skeptic when Apple came out with the iPhone, iPad and the watch and ended up eating my words. I use all three products daily. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When the iPhone came out I was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/15/iStillLoveMyBlackberry.html&quot;&gt;Blackberry&lt;/a&gt; user and loved it. I was angry with Apple for not running Mac software on the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had reasons for not liking the iPad and watch, but eventually used the iPad even more than the iPhone and I wear the watch every day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;None of them for me were revolutionary products, but they were good products. Worthwhile products. Impossible to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: On the other hand, here's my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/07/25/iphoneMonth1.html&quot;&gt;one-month review&lt;/a&gt; of the first iPhone. It was not at time, for me, a winner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I'm watching the last episode every night. Still finding new things to admire. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/01/fattweet.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the tweet in all its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordnik.com/words/corpulence&quot;&gt;corpulence&lt;/a&gt;. It's way easier to read than a headline and a link to a blog post. They should work on the formatting a bit. The text is too large and there isn't enough spacing between lines. But it works, and is a welcome addition. There's still &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;more to do&lt;/a&gt; -- let's have optional titles, links, styling, editing and enclosures.</description>

			<description>Mastodon, Bluesky and Twitter should not be silos relative to each other. I'm starting to post links to Masto on Twitter, and links to Twitter on Bluesky. All combos. I realized I was, in my mind, assuming these &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; silos. I think other people do too. That's not a good limit to impose, doesn't work in our interests, as users and developers.</description>

			<description>I wonder if any librarians have written about ChatGPT. I bet they &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; worried about losing their jobs. That's the thing. When Napster was booting up, most of us were thrilled with the ability to finally program our own music. Now we take it for granted. Google was, it turns out, just a glimpse into the future. What we really wanted was a virtual librarian who had access to all the information available to our civilization. Now we're getting there. When I was growing up, the librarians, who became my friends, only had access to a very small fraction of what was known. Basically the books that can fit into a modest-size &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/auburndale&quot;&gt;storefront&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7735726,-73.796516,3a,75y,39.57h,88.29t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sfiPCQ2wAdxLKEBfrKPHoiQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DfiPCQ2wAdxLKEBfrKPHoiQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D39.14713%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;.
