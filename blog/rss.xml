			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112671088952473981&quot;&gt;want&lt;/a&gt; to be able to run Frontier on the new Macs, but was disappointed that VMware doesn’t work and had given up on the idea. But I just learned that UTM might work. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/38d87439-9a34-402d-9c46-7a047e7e2866&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of my inquiry. Wondering if &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112671088952473981&quot;&gt;anyone has had good experience&lt;/a&gt; using UTM to run older Mac software on Apple CPUs.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112671576365142333&quot;&gt;Heard&lt;/a&gt; an interview show on NPR where they went to laundromats and asked people about the upcoming election. Big surprise they say pretty much exactly what they say on the news about the candidates, all of it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance#:~:text=False%20balance%2C%20known%20colloquially%20as,viewpoints%20than%20the%20evidence%20supports.&quot;&gt;bothsidesisms&lt;/a&gt; and no mention of the fascism coming our way if we go one direction. It's all everyone's fault, so why bother voting, is mostly what they say. SMH in disbelief.</description>

It isn't about Guha or Libby, me, or whoever. It's really about the power of Netscape and the early web news publishing companies that supported RSS, and the blogging systems that jumped on board (including my own products) and then two years later, the NYT coming on board, followed by the entire news industry. A bunch of nerds arguing on a mail list is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the story. With the benefit of well over twenty years hindsight this should, by now, be kind of obvious.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C8mUXGiMODB&quot;&gt;Threads could&lt;/a&gt; make it a lot easier for us to cross-post to their system, esp since they say they will support ActivityPub. As it is there are too many hoops to jump through imho. I think basically they all want you to use their UI's which amounts to writing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little textboxes&lt;/a&gt; of course.</description>

It tells the story of RSS as a remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in 1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the &lt;i&gt;entire news world supported RSS.&lt;/i&gt; That's the story. You can write all about who did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn't work with each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course until the real story is out there, we can't learn from it. This is a 14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the sites it points to. And if there's interest I'll happily talk about it in a future podcast.</description>

So while she’s feeling a bit ill under it all is a feeling of splendor and the usual over the top cuteness! :-)</description>

I'm really getting into this. I'm definitely going to come up with a nice pure podcast feed for Scripting News. But first I have some new software to ship. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Comments are often spam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;More and more I see comments, unless explicitly asked for, as spam that I'd disable if I could. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the energy in social networks these days goes into keeping the garbage out of replies. If originators had stronger tools, there would be less work for the platform to do, and overall happier people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, I often limit comments to friends, who don't tend to spam, presumably because we like to stay on good terms, and spam is an imposition, at best, and often insulting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;? That's the kind of bullshit Google does. We don't do that in the open formats and protocols world. What really pains me is they claim to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; Rules for Standards-makers. Imho they do not. Two rules apply. &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000&quot;&gt;Rule #1&lt;/a&gt; says the only reason we do this is interop. It's called Rule #1 for a reason. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;one way&lt;/a&gt; rule a little further down the page. I've seen this happen twice where people say they abide by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;RFSM&lt;/a&gt; but then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the name you've chosen. We've been down this path. The only way it ends is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/134901.html?title=standardsKitty&quot;&gt;tears&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Now that I'm publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in commercial podcast clients, I'm learning for the first time how they work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that would have worked if I hadn't made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601&quot;&gt;mistake&lt;/a&gt; in GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say &quot;Hey readers dump your cache now, let's start over, because I fcuked up.&quot; It wouldn't have mattered anyway, I'm sure none of them would listen, right?</description>

			<title>Facebook APIs are a sad place</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started to write the code to hook up my linkblogger to Threads, but it led me to the same website with all my broken Facebook apps, the ones that stopped working when they shut down the API after the 2016 election. A reminder that this is still Facebook. And while I don't blame them for shutting down the APIs, the whole experience left a really bad feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I backed out of the project to give it some more thought. Do I really want to go down this road?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course I had the cute little kitten illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/20/kittenStartledByThreadsAPI.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The kitten is startled by the Facebook developer site.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A cute little kitten is sitting at a desk with a laptop, preparing to write an app. The laptop screen shows code for the Threads API from Meta. The kitten has a surprised and concerned expression as she looks at the developer site on another screen, which shows a Facebook logo and reminds her of the events of 2016. In the background, a calendar shows the year 2024. The scene is set in a cozy room with soft lighting and a few toys scattered around, giving it a homely feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's from June 14, 2004. It's 1/2 of a panel in 1991 that I was on with Bill Gates. This is before the turn to the web. At this point I'm starting to look around for audio that might fit into this new audio blog channel that goes with my written blog.</description>

			<description>Technical note. I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/datesoff.png&quot;&gt;mistake&lt;/a&gt; in converting local time to GMT in the code that builds the feed. My times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are now six. I bet all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the creation date of the item, and they changed. Oh well. At least the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS version&lt;/a&gt; only has three items. I think I should change how the guid works.</description>

			<title>The FeedLand stack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over at any level, you can, and today I'm doing exactly that. But first here's the stack:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the lowest level is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple package&lt;/a&gt;, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the source &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/a&gt; are included, where they are present.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Above that level is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase&quot;&gt;feedlanddatabase package&lt;/a&gt;, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds, subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I'm going to start building today.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Next level up is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland&quot;&gt;feedland package&lt;/a&gt;, which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff that the FeedLand client needs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST interface happens here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; I'm working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that's already there. The advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage the data structures. So that's what I'm doing. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The next patriotic kitten</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that the music industry had concocted. They didn't give a shit about the users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users. We supposedly didn't have any. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman&quot;&gt;Emmett Chapman&lt;/a&gt;, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick&quot;&gt;musicial instrument&lt;/a&gt; for himself and others to use. That's what I do with software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there's been plenty of time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out. For that he would say Every day is Father's Day. That may be my greatest accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought (and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our uncle Ken, on my mother's side, and said he would have shit his pants over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine. The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I'm absolutely sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my great uncle &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno&lt;/a&gt; who was a pioneer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;zettlekasten&lt;/a&gt; would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a shorter name). People's first reaction is that by creating art with ChatGPT I'm stealing. Bollocks. I'm creating. I'm not even going to validate that with a rebuttal. I am proving it with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patriotic+Kitten%22&quot;&gt;Patriotic Kitten&lt;/a&gt; thread, the next of which I will now entertain you with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/patrioticKitten2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The second patriotic kitten. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a quick look indicates that it's a fairly large project. All I want to do is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There's no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I'm going to have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>For people who use &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. If you accidentally close a file that's open and want it to re-appear in its previous position, you can edit your prefs.json file. You can find it by choosing &lt;i&gt;Open Data Folder&lt;/i&gt; from the File menu. You'll see prefs.json. Open it in a text editor, and make the changes you want -- carefully. Probably a good idea to make a copy of the file before editing. But I just did it and laughed out loud, why didn't I think of this before? Heh.</description>

			<title>Twenty years ago today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM&quot;&gt;June 11, 2004&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me, it's June &lt;i&gt;2024&lt;/i&gt; now, it's been &lt;i&gt;twenty freaking years&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and it's still as open as it was back in June 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast&lt;/b&gt;. That was the goal. You don't need anyone's permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less real and less interesting, imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My partner in this at the time was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry&quot;&gt;Adam Curry&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime in that period he started &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code&quot;&gt;The Daily Source Code&lt;/a&gt;, and then we did a podcast together for a few months called &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. My own podcast was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months, with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows. I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew, Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine won't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the URL for the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck. I'll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I'll register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that's still thriving twenty years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should be quite a story! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004. And that's the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in Seattle at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/gnomedexDaveAdam.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Dave and Adam at Gnomedex in 2004.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the creativity of ChatGPT, some call it hallucinations, but maybe all the rest of this stuff is hallucinating, maybe only ChatGPT sees what's real? Could be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the prompt: &quot;PODCAST0 from Dave Winer with occasional appearances by Adam Curry, all original 2004 podcasts, the very first podcasts in the galaxy, and possibly the universe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/allthepodcasts.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;All the original 2004 podcasts. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When I started the project, I had no idea what I'd find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don't know the extent of it, but there's a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I'm thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I'm beginning to see the utility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; as a feed operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It's not just a feed reader. It's able to do things most feed readers don't do, maybe none do. We don't have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either. I will of course share the results when they are shareable.</description>

			<description>Three movies I've watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The Matrix. 3. The Devil's Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they go together. And they're all about the same thing, about choosing to live in a dream, or to live the life you're actually living. All three are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to end, which is really unusual for me these days.</description>

			<title>Imagine RSS as a cover story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; has never been on the cover of a magazine, so you can't say ChatGPT is stealing this from anyone. In fact I'm offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press has chosen to focus on the idea that it's plagiarizing journalists. The ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they're doing their jobs, they're reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series&quot;&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt;. I don't owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I read the news on their site. The news doesn't belong to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn't so far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no billionaires involved, so they didn't consider it newsworthy I guess. Some day we're going to have to accept that we have to make our own news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker's famous line -- &quot;If you don't like the news go out and make some of your own.&quot; So here we go. I asked ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/16/imagineTheyPutRSSOnACover.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Imagine RSS as the cover story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read printed magazines?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a server that's returning &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; files. It's not the first time I've done this, but now there seem to be enough other people interested in this that it's worth raising this question. What content type should I use. Generally I've been using text/xml. But I see other people using text/opml. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opml.org/issues/20&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
