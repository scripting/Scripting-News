			<description>If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I'd like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There's nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we're on leads, and don't give people a reason to hope that it's not as serious as it is.</description>

			<title>They're letting us have RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Assume that FB doesn't really want to interop, so that's why there's a year timeline on developing AP functionality. No rush. Let's keep growing and later on we can have an app store that only lets certain sites into our world, subject to our turning them off at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assuming this is true, RSS is their worst nightmare. It's implemented in a week, if you're really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vociferous&quot;&gt;vociferous&lt;/a&gt; users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they're pissing in the wind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember they said RSS is Dead. I always felt that was aimed at me, but it was aimed at them too, even more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing to do, build -- intelligently, slowly, showing interop at every step. Watch out for people who take stuff out with out putting back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>There's actual news tonight</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/231219/p55#a231219p55&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; tonight, when there's some &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/19/us/trump-colorado-ballot-news#trump-colorado-ballot-14th-amendment&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, and it's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;What they're not saying is that the US has the tools to defend itself from enemies like Trump, and finally we're starting to use them. Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html&quot;&gt;last resort&lt;/a&gt; to keep a nightmare out of the government.  An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters. But -- better late than never. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if they want to have a civil war, okay -- better to do it when the military is under constitutional control, at least theoretically. Tell the Republicans to try again, now before any primary votes have been cast. This candidate is prohibited from being president, as if he were born outside the United States. Not qualified. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Facebook offers AI participation a private group</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a private group on Facebook, and just got &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/19/metaAiInvite.png&quot;&gt;this notice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Join the waitlist for Meta AI in your group! Meta AI can save you time and spark conversations by answering questions posted in your group, linking people to the posts they find most helpful, and more. Sign up your group to be the first to get access when it becomes available in your region.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I clicked on the &lt;i&gt;Learn More&lt;/i&gt; button, this is what came back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A new way to get questions answered&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Meta AI will comment on questions that haven't gotten an answer after one hour&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Keep members engaged&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Meta AI's answers will summarize earlier group discussions and share past posts from the group, helping to build community and spark discussion&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Stay in control&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You'll be able to delete any of Meta AI's comments, turn it off anytime, and customize it for your group&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A thought -- this kind of feature could not have been offered a year ago. The online world and journalism would never have accepted it from Facebook. But now they're called Meta and that seems to matter. ChatGPT has created a new opening. Not sure I'm going to like it, esp since this is mostly a one-way group. It's not for discussions. But it's the only group they offered to, and I love this stuff and want to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't told the members of the group that I've requested this. Am I obligated to do that?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also in private groups where people reveal personal info (not the purpose of this group) I could see where this would be very controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Music at The Colony</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;The Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. It's small venue that &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/&quot;&gt;goes way back&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/19/levinBrothers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Levin Brothers band at The Colony, Sunday night. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt;, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin&quot;&gt;Pete Levin&lt;/a&gt; on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To me, music is as software probably is to most people who use it. I love it, but I don't have much of an idea of how it's made. The last few years I've been reintroduced to it in a new way, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention&quot;&gt;thanks&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE&quot;&gt;Get Back documentary&lt;/a&gt;, which gave us a view into the Beatles' creative process, something I wish I could have seen when I was much younger. The Beatles were the music my generation grew up with, but I never really even understood that there was a difference between a John song and a Paul song. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second great influence has been Andrew Hickey's &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;500 songs&lt;/a&gt; podcast. Now I have so many more stories to go with the music that my life was formed by. And I have a feeling that attending this event on Sunday will turn out to be a similar influence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, what music should I go see next? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The concert was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nippertown.com/2023/12/18/concert-review-the-levin-brothers-the-linda-12-16-2023/&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's how we're doing it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for Brent's account on Bluesky, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It's too good an opportunity to pass up.</description>

			<source:outline text="I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2023/12/17/on_mastodon_support_in_netnewswire&quot;&gt;Brent's piece&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon and NetNewsWire, holding my breath hoping he'd arrive at the same answer I did, and he did. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is perfect for Mastodon, it supports RSS, as does NNW (of course), and that's imho exactly the right way to connect the two. That's how we're doing it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for Brent's account on Bluesky, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It's too good an opportunity to pass up." created="Mon, 18 Dec 2023 03:40:45 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/01/10/loveRss.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/17.html#a034045"/>

			<description>One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account to feed we do with sites that support &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html&quot;&gt;feed discovery&lt;/a&gt;. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for Bluesky. I expect we'll do that for FeedLand via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;FeedHunter package&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>The last episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png&quot;&gt;Oh The Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Just let me know what Metacritic says, and make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I want more info. Don't make me look it up. People joke about how we spend our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it's true, I do it. Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online. How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of the links generated by their CMS are broken.)</description>

			<description>I'm starting to scope out if it would be possible to create an Electron version of FeedLand. I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/e825efea-c271-4c24-8594-01a03c21f3af&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT about that. We did not arrive at a plan. FeedLand uses MySQL, I can't convert to another SQL, we have to use the same codebase in all versions. If, after reading the chat, you have ideas, please post a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/282&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>You're supposed to know</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you all know, I was a math major in college. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the weirdest choice for me because, until my first semester of college, not been interested in math. I thought it was boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out math &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; boring, the teachers were boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a math professor in freshman year, at Lehman College, in the Bronx, who showed me first that I could do it, and then led me to the discovery that hey this is amazing. So I majored in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't do great, B-minus average. But there was one class I got an A in, a summer class (in New Orleans), and it was the only class I took. I think that made a big difference, I could just focus on this one subject. My mind has always been like that, I like to zoom in on things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I remember one day, almost 50 years ago, the professor was standing in front of the class, fuming, angry. We had all turned in proofs that didn't work and that included grad students, he pointed out (I was an undergrad). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He said this: &quot;You're supposed to know when you've proven it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Might be the most important thing I learned from all the math. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not math if your proof doesn't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years later I'm a grad student in Computer Science, and a teaching assistant for a class in assembly language. First semester I was learning it along with the students, although I had already had a class in assembly, you don't really learn it until you teach it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I promised to post example code on the door of my office for students to copy if they needed help on an assignment. I did. When I got back, one of my office mates, whose name I remember to this day, was, like my math prof at Tulane, fuming, this time at me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She said this -- you have to run your code before you post it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was fire coming out of her eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was right. I was shamed. And obviously never forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same story really. A proof that doesn't work isn't math. And code that doesn't run isn't software.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>So, with the &quot;Bloggers&quot; category not yet ready for prime time, I've replaced it with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=all&quot;&gt;All category&lt;/a&gt; from FeedLand, changing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/14/newstab.png&quot;&gt;title to News&lt;/a&gt;. I know it's confusing. I think there's going to be a fair amount of this kind of shuffling in the weeks and months ahead, as we try to fit news and blogs together in interesting ways. You can read the Bloggers category on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, even with &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; no longer on the home page of scripting.com, it still gets more hits than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;. There's something there to look at. I want to do more to integrate the blog and the news. To make some kind of new publication that has a bunch of voices, yet doesn't spin out of control.</description>

I started watching the new one, and all of a sudden the two princes, William and Harry, are actual people. I have a lot of trouble with that, because of course I remember when they were born. However I'm pretty sure I'll go all the way through. There are a lot of hours of entertainment in The Crown and a few scenes that are truly spectacular (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;). I remember the really good ones of course, but there's an awful lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schlock&quot;&gt;schlock&lt;/a&gt;. One scene I had not remembered was a pretty good illustration of how fucked up people can be. Princess Diana had just gone on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqe-SuyAyWI&quot;&gt;tour of NYC&lt;/a&gt;, her first international tour on her own, and it was (surprising to her) a huge success. Another British invasion. The people of NYC loved Diana (at least in the show, I don't remember this, I was living in California at the time). So she comes home, and the royal family, instead of cheering her, were angry with her for being so charming. Go figure. Her husband, Prince Charles is yelling at her and he asks her if she ever considered how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla&quot;&gt;Camilla&lt;/a&gt;, Charles' one true love, would feel about Diana being so popular. Diana is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gobsmacked&quot;&gt;gobsmacked&lt;/a&gt; (as am I). Why would she think of that. How totally fucked up is that. Why should anyone, being themselves, being happy, worry about how anyone else might feel about their happiness? I've been in Diana's position a few times, achieving success, much deserved, and was reminded that this upset people who (apparently) didn't want me to succeed? I have even been asked that question. If you ever feel that way, that someone else's happiness is meant to make you feel bad, remember Carl Sagan's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; video. Really, &lt;i&gt;no one cares&lt;/i&gt; if you are offended by someone else's happiness. Remember, none of this stuff amounts to anything in the big picture. We're very small, all of us put together, in the grand scheme of things. So if you're happy, good for you! And one other question -- is re-bingeing actually a word?? &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: 0.6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love my writing. Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We weren't very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440&quot;&gt;hear from them&lt;/a&gt;, and that's especially lovely.</description>

It's an idea hatched by techies who aren't thinking about how people actually use these systems and which features are valued and which are problematic. Imho, what's valued is the ability to publish something quickly, and without much fuss, and follow others, again easily without having to have a deep understanding of how these things are architected. No one but us programming plumbers cares. I think the idea of &lt;i&gt;conversation&lt;/i&gt; not only is overrated, but it's where all the problems are, where all the abuse happens. If we focus on the benefits, quick dissemination of news, and the power of the individual to choose their sources and share them with others -- that's where the juice is.

Imho of course, ymmv, praise Murphy, I am not a lawyer and my mother loved me, even though at times it was hard to tell. &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: 0.4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Wed, 13 Dec 2023 13:52:18 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/13/frozenOrangeJuiceFromHannafords.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a135218"/>

Along the way he wondered how I find something to write every day. The answer -- I don't find things to write, it doesn't work that way. I don't sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write 1000 words and it doesn't matter what it's about. If I have something to say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say, because I'm always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get there. A lot of trial and error, let's see if this way of putting it works, or that one, etc. There's a slogan for this -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html&quot;&gt;Narrate Your Work&lt;/a&gt; -- and my work is narratable and creates its own record because I do my work right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it. And if I can get the people I need to listen to me, ie read my blog, then we can work together (a recurring theme) to make great communication systems out of the web and avoid flushing our future down the toilet, which we always seem to be doing.</description>

			<description>Another time I blog about is when I figure something out that I've been trying to understand for a long time, in some cases my whole life. That still happens. The other day I found myself talking with a friend about love, why when someone says &quot;I love you&quot; it doesn't mean what it seems to. Love comes from understanding someone well enough that you know what they desire, what they ache to have, and you to try to help them get it. See all the qualifications in that. Try. Help. Them. In other words, you can love someone when you know them. And you don't give them what they want, you help them get it. You can't love someone who your whole idea of is based on a dream you have about them. That's different. Anyway, lots more to say about all this. It's a recurring topic. It might be the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; topic. Someday they'll invent an AI that can analyze my writing and tell me if I've ever written for any other purpose than being worthy of love.</description>

Debugging its database was several orders of magnitude less work than the Node+SQL setup where the runtime and the database are very far apart. In Frontier the database and the language are the same thing. And because Frontier did the rational thing with synchronization, it was handled in the kernel, the code you write doesn't have to worry about it, you can write reasonably readable code. In Node it's a real chore to come back to some code you worked on last a while back. Makes my mind tired, but I do it, because it's where I work now.</description>

For once can people look out for the future, keep the window open for independence for writers and developers, and let us try out some new ideas that might not be something Zuckerberg would love?

			<description>Starting in September or so I start thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many people care, but it's a good thing for me to do -- to review what makes a blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me -- obviously. We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved. People think &quot;well it's just me and I don't matter&quot; -- which is totally true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least &lt;i&gt;they'll&lt;/i&gt; know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value, which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last year I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915&quot;&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; Heather Cox Richardson, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack site&lt;/a&gt; is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different times, and if I'm up and in the mood, I'll spend a few minutes with HCR and it's always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.</description>

And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy things for them to write about! We're not doing that. It started out well, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.&quot;&gt;Woman's March on January 20, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but that was it. We can and must keep showing up, and I'm not advocating huge marches, I want to see neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk (if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music, food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not against something but &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; all of us. All we have to do is figure out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our democracy would be in the best shape it's been in probably since inception. I had another idea that's worth considering. We should all wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a photo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;Martin Luther King&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but it didn't catch on. If we all did, it's omission would be noticed, and we'd know there's someone we should talk with about America and offer them a free button, nicely, if they'll put it on right now. Anyway, I'm putting this out there again, and I'll keep doing it.</description>

			<description>There's an interesting recent development in the world of feeds and blogs -- blogs that are only feeds. Designed to be read in feed readers of all sizes and shapes. I have a few of these myself. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; for example. Also, FeedLand provides an outbound &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?myfeed&quot;&gt;feed to every user&lt;/a&gt;, which meets all the qualifications of a feed-only blog.</description>

I have a few of these myself. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; for example.

			<title>Working together for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/06/29/alice.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I want to say this as loudly and clearly as I can. If we want independent writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I can refer back to it. I really don't have a good way yet to find stuff I've written. It's all there on the web, for crying out loud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very little of that. It's amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by other developers. This is a huge problem, it's why we've always been dominated by big companies who don't care about what we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start with a search engine for bloggers. I'll help. And let's do lots of them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>General note</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for some reason I don't find out about the work until it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there's a reason -- I want to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course I'll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How we got here</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you through that. Now that it works on phones, I can see how nice it is to be able to skim the news while you're out and about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you're working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been some huge ones this year. The product's identity system had to be replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/&quot;&gt;Automattic VIP server&lt;/a&gt; required fairly large pieces of the software to be rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There's a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime environment doesn't include local storage. Everything has to be stored in a database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; we had to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with this product. And one more thing, let's get this mofo working on mobile devices as it was meant to, which turned out to be not as hard as I imagined, and very nice to have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new version of the software with all the new code turned on is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt;. That's the version that's running on Automattic's servers, and should be able to scale to far more users. The docs aren't converted yet, but the software is basically the same. You should read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of the docs, at least, so you aren't surprised to find out that your subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product, it's more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see what would happen if instead of building something complicated around conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see where we could go with that. That's what FeedLand is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I can't believe how fast Automattic's system is. I don't understand how it does all that work in so little time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The menus are different on the mobile version, by necessity. I included the Bookmarks menu, it's really important to have the news you want to read available one click away in mobile. I imagine doing setup on your home computer, with links you'll use when you're using the mobile version. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/10/feedlandScreen1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The mobile-ready &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is ready to use.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's the best mobile version of anything I've done. I finally figured out how this works, I think. So if you're using FeedLand on a phone, sometime in the next 24-48 hours you may see a significant improvement. I will of course write a blog post about it with screen shots when it does become available.</description>
