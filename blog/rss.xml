			<title>I don't eat dog food thank you</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Loving a series I just heard about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/this-is-going-to-hurt/&quot;&gt;This Is Going To Hurt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I discovered it the usual tedious way, scrolling through newly available shows on one of the streaming services with my iPad handy and when I see one that looks interesting, I look it up on Metacritic. If the rating is below 60, I don't look any further, but this show was rated 91, which is a very high rating. It's a British medical drama, the characters and story are fantastic, you can see that right from the beginning. They do show a lot of surgery details, I wish they didn't, I just can't watch that stuff. But I hold the iPad up to block the screen when it gets hard to watch, and I judge from the dialog when the gore is over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I can't stomach are pictures of dog food, esp &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; eating dog food. If you have a similar phobia, episode 4 of Pluribus, which is as usual great, is hard to watch, but the segment where a character eats dog food is self contained. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There also a commercial for dog food that opens with a chunk of the most disgusting dog food, from a company that makes dog food that looks like human food. They're challenging you with a question, would you eat this shit? Well no! -- and I don't want to look at it either dammit. It's why I don't like the term dogfooding, ie people using their own products. As much as I love dogs, the people who use my software are not dogs, and my software is not dog food. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I want to add that I have a vague memory of actually eating dog food when I was a small child with a bunch of equally young friends because we were curious about what it was like. My memory is that it isn't bad. But the memory for me, now as an adult, is nauseating. I like eating human food, even though I'm sure in other contexts it's equally disgusting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But do watch This Is Going To Hurt. Sorry it's only seven episodes, I would have loved it to continue for another few seasons. I have one more episode left to watch, though it totally could have ended after six episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm continuing to work on the way FeedLand detects changes in feed items. This morning I did a careful study of the function that gets a guid for an item in conjunction with ChatGPT. It would be so much easier if RSS 2.0 required an item-level &amp;lt;guid&gt; element, but it doesn't. That was the philosophy, all item-level values are optional. My notes are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDev/issues/11#issuecomment-3563675430&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

When we check a feed, we check each item, if the item already exists, we look at each of the values stored for the item compared with their new values in the feed, and if any have changed, we broadcast the message that the item has changed. I'm doing a complete review of this, based on actual data, and found there were a fair number of places we were calling a change, when nothing that mattered had changed. Now I'm debating whether or not a &lt;i&gt;pubDate&lt;/i&gt; change should be seen as an item change. My initial thought when we were working on RSS, was that the pubDate should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; change. In the real world of publishing I don't think the publication date changes. Right? Of course some feeds do change the pubDate because that's the &lt;i&gt;art of feeds&lt;/i&gt; (sorry for the sarcasm). But I don't think FeedLand should call that a change. Wondering what other feed developers do? So I asked ChatGPT. This is incredibly valuable &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/691f3cff-6998-8012-b505-8734bf11630f&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I learned is that people use &lt;i&gt;atom:updated.&lt;/i&gt; It's true RSS 2.0 has no item that says when an item updated. Anyway net-net, the consensus is that a change in pubDate is not a change. I don't think I'm going to make it immutable though.</description>

			<description>The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;Amazon Alexa with AI&lt;/a&gt; has the same basic problem of all AI bots, it acts as if it's human, with a level of intimacy that you really don't want to think about, because Alexa is in your house, with you, listening, all the time. Calling attention to an idea that there's a psuedo-human spying on you is bad. Alexa depends on the opposite impression, that it's just a computer. I think AI's should give up the pretense that they're human, and this one should be first.</description>

Ghost has been beating the drum about their ActivityPub support for (many) months. I don't know if they're actually there yet, I've never knowingly seen something from Ghost on Mastodon. I sent an email to Matt this morning suggesting that we promote the incredible connection between WordPress and Mastodon via ActivityPub. In the early days of the blogosphere we had the same problem, there was no good way to see who was writing, so we started a site called weblogs.com, which ping'd each site that we knew about to see if it had changed, if so it went to the top of a list that was published at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. So if you wanted to find out what's new you'd just go there. It got more complicated over time, as the blogosphere grew at a very fast clip. We could do that for WordPress sites on ActivityPub by pointing to their site from a weblogs.com-like site. There's no shame in telling the world about the cool new technology you've made, esp when it will make life so much more interesting! But it can't do that if they don't know it's there. Let's do some promotion. :-)</description>

			<description>The news gets everything wrong about the nouns of our political system. They talk about Repubs and Dems, but the real power is with the people.  Something that Heather Cox Richardson said so eloquently in this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heather-cox-richardson-people-are-starved-for-facts/id1817225413?i=1000736787935&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Nicolle Wallace. I know I recommended it yesterday, but please do listen to this and don't forget it. When you're watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://ms.now/&quot;&gt;MSNOW&lt;/a&gt; you're getting the wrong nouns. I think this problem could be solved by moving every show on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ms.now/&quot;&gt;MSNOW&lt;/a&gt; to a different American city. The people on the panels should come to work in Detroit, St Louis, Phonenix, Denver, Charleston, Cleveland, Seattle, places like that. Get out of NY and DC. Really connect yourself to the whole country. That would rock a lot of boats.</description>

			<source:markdown>The news gets everything wrong about the nouns of our political system. They talk about Repubs and Dems, but the real power is with the people. Something that Heather Cox Richardson said so eloquently in this week's [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heather-cox-richardson-people-are-starved-for-facts/id1817225413?i=1000736787935) with Nicolle Wallace. I know I recommended it yesterday, but please do listen to this and don't forget it. When you're watching [MSNOW](https://ms.now/) you're getting the wrong nouns.

			<description>I love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ms.now/&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for MSNOW. Just before it came out, Jeff Jarvis wondered on all the social networks why it wasn't msnow.com. Well, because they found an even better domain.</description>

			<description>BTW, one of the areas of breakage is in our handling of source:markdown. What changed? There are now feeds I didn't create (ie &quot;in the wild&quot;)  that have source:markdown elements. This bug is 100% my doing. The feeds are fine. These are the kinds of bugs you like to find, and fix.</description>

			<description>I'm preparing FeedLand to reliably do things we haven't had it do yet, at least not at scale. It has one important feature most other feed management systems don't have, dynamic OPML lists that I keep touting here. I have a product that can both generate them and use them on behalf of users. But it's a lot more fun if there are other products that can do the same. It means we can build networks of feed sharing apps, no kidding -- it's going to do new things for us the same way RSS did new things for us 22 years ago. Now it can be fun when there are more FeedLand instances out there. It'd be more fun if they were products like Overcast or Pocket Casts. Sometimes companies like Apple or Microsoft show up in these little projects, it has happened (Apple supported XML-RPC, for example. Microsoft supported Frontier in MSIE on the Mac.).</description>

It seems to work really well. The WordPress site is &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;Daveverse&lt;/a&gt;. And because it's on WordPress it is also available on ActivityPub, at @scripting@daveverse.org, which means you can read it on Mastodon. It doesn't feel weird at all to be reading a blog post on a social network. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3m5rlfrhgec2z&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky that we would love to have the same connection with their social network. It might happen sooner than you think. There are people developing writing tools for ATProto, but they're kind of stuck since Bluesky has all those limits that exclude the &lt;a href=&quot;https://writersweb.org/&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt;. It's so complicated, but out the other end, I hope will come a consensus that the social web should use more of the text features of the web. Further, the distributed nature of the web itself can form the backbone of distribution for the social web, that is if you think &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is part of the web. When it's all said and done, we will realize that TBL got it right when he designed text with titles, subheads, styling, links, editing, no character limits, etc. He probably didn't even have to think about it much, considering he was basically replicating the standard document features from word processing apps of the 70s and 80s, without the printing. That's how evolution works, and the last 19 years of distortion by Twitter and those that followed them, will be seen as a weird transcription error (I hope).</description>

I'll be testing this out and thinking about it now, as we go forward. But here's the milestone: I have a WordPress place to hook into now that has pretty much everything I write outside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;. What I write in WordLand or Drummer, the two places I write for real. The rest of it is throw away nonsense, a waste of time. No one reads anything, everyone fighting for attention.</description>

			<description>I was going to tell you how much I like the Lever podcast, and wanted to recommend it, but they make it impossible to find the RSS url for the feed. The usual hacks don't seem to work. Since I'm subscribed to it on Pocket Casts, I thought I might be able to find the URL on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt;, and it's possible I might have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/podcast/lever-time/0b05d150-ba7d-013a-d90c-0acc26574db2&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it that way. Nope. It just points to the web page for the podcast, which did not have the RSS feed. I know they must have one. I was looking for a way to download my OPML file, would be nice if you could do it from the desktop.</description>

			<description>We ought to be thinking about a filtering system for feed readers based on instructions written by users, and shared on the web, to be parsed by our AI. Design your personal algorithm with an AI engine. Share the good ones with your friends, and have it work on the web, in any feed reader. There are ways to do that. If you're working on such a project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/337&quot;&gt;let's hook it up&lt;/a&gt; to FeedLand. It does a lot of feed reading, and has a nice API for downstream feed readers. It's a good place for an AI-based filter.</description>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2025/11/16/sun-day/&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt;, I have trouble getting into TV series, but not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt;, probably because it came from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilligan&quot;&gt;showrunner&lt;/a&gt; of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, two series that I have watched from beginning to end at least three times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The star of Pluribus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn&quot;&gt;Rhea Seahorn&lt;/a&gt;, was my favorite in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;, as Kim Wexler. So I expected a continuation of those shows, and in some sense Pluribus &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; much like them, but the main character Carol, is nothing like Kim -- who is by far the coolest character in any of the shows, and that's saying a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's okay because the &lt;i&gt;sweetest&lt;/i&gt; character yet in a Vince Gilligan comedy (all these shows are comedies btw, even though the plots are super heavy), is Carol's sidekick, Zosia, played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolina_Wydra&quot;&gt;Karolina Wydra&lt;/a&gt;. She's basically the voice of the Others, but the illusion is so alluring, one character in the show has already (understandably) fallen in love with her. And we know that Carol has formed an attachment too, despite her best efforts to hate her. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, this post is the first one that's cross-posted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/11/16/3096/&quot;&gt;daveverse site&lt;/a&gt;. There still are some things to fix, but this is a nice piece of software. Basically implements what I've been calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22inbound%20rss%22&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS&lt;/a&gt;, not for a social web app, rather for WordPress (which in my mind is becoming more of a social web system every day).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Instead of scattering Stupid Little Text Boxes (SLTBs) all over creation, let’s come up with a nice text router, that means our writing can be in one place, but through the magic of pointers, can appear to be in many places. (Actually there's nothing magical about it, pointers are very basic computer technology, when I learned to program on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11_architecture&quot;&gt;PDP-11&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 it very much had pointers.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s mostly a matter of GOST (an acronym for Getting Our Shit Together).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All this is a preamble to say that my comment on your post can be read here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/11/16/3096/&quot;&gt;https://daveverse.org/2025/11/16/3096/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s also on scripting.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See how that works.

			<title>More testing stuffffff</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;With any luck this will be the last of the tests for this particular feature. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this continues to work, tomorrow or Monday I'll switch it over to cross-posting to daveverse instead of the throw-away test site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Below are the debugging messages I used today. Nothing really happening here. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those days I am pretty sure I have &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; to write but as I get going I'll remember stuff. Maybe. As you've probably surmised I'm still working on tests. These are called regression tests. Yesterday I got the whole thing running, but knew I still had to move things around, and turn some features off that weren't needed. So every time I do one of those things that could shake things up, I have to try it again to make sure I didn't break it. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2025/11/15/477/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; I have to look at for the result. The cool thing is that the wordpress site is starting to feel like scripting.com, the software runs that quickly. But there are a lot of bits of software running all over the place that have to work in order for it to feel that solid. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How did the regression test go? Wellll, I did break a bunch of stuff. But I put the pieces back in place. And with any luck this post will show up on the other end. &lt;i&gt;It did.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I love stories like this, with new assumptions about what is, and people coping with what may or may not be great, or boring, or who knows what. I know they've got me thinking about it all the time, and that is what I like in a good televised story.</description>

They've been very welcoming. It's kind of like I imagine it would be for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; to be working with Wikipedia. It may not have been everything he wanted from wiki's but it might be the best place for him to develop new features, most likely to have an influence on the way wikis are used in the real world. It's also kind of like it might have been if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart&lt;/a&gt; had been willing to hook up with Living Videotext back in the day. I had a couple of dinners with him in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California&quot;&gt;Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt; where I presented the idea. We had a growing user base of outliner users, our products had commercial success that weren't possible in the 60s and 70s, before there were personal computers like the Apple II or Macintosh. If he could help us, it would be good for both of us, I reasoned. He had his own codebase, and was working with a bunch of other people, and was happy with the setup. In 2025, I have ambitions for WordPress, I think it can play a bigger and different role in the web than it does. I believe there's a new class of developers and users who could benefit from the stability and scaling of WordPress. It's a good community, it's basically the web itself, which means imho that it can grow to be new things to new people. Anyway, you can see why this post has to be on both scripting.com and on my daveverse site as I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/13.html#a165641&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I'm going to post something new and see if it makes it through to the other side. And you get to see if it works or not. And now I'm going to make a change. Having made the change I want to see if it made it through. It's kind of remarkable to me that I got this much done in one day. That's what happens when you invested in good tools. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2025/11/14/467/&quot;&gt;this is where&lt;/a&gt; the changes have been visible, on a scratch site used just for these occasions. Tomorrow, the third day of this project, I clean up the loose ends and then we should be good to go with the posts I make on scripting showing up in daveverse. Then I can get started with the next project that depends on this.</description>

I still want to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; to write stuff for scripting.com, there's a whole system built around it being where it is. But, I want all the posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt; to also appear on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse&lt;/a&gt; site, so that the first version of my discourse module can be simple to create, debug and use. So I've got the first half working, I've got a script that hooks in via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;WebSockets to FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and is notified every time Scripting News updates. It mirrors the updates to a site on WordPress (for testing) and once it works, I'll have it send the stuff to daveverse. That part remains to be done. Not sure if it'll be a desktop app or a server-based app. But now I need a break. ;-)</description>

			<description>Today I'm going to work on re-shaping the docs for source:markdown because it seems to becoming a thing that people are supporting in their feeds and in their feed consumer apps. We're going to have discuss how it's supported, on both ends. What goes into a source:markdown element, and what does not, and how should readers use it. I will assume the role of benevolent dictator, as I did with RSS 2.0, with a bit more of an understanding of what's important. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000&quot;&gt;Rule #1&lt;/a&gt; in Rules for Standards-makers. &quot;The only reason we have open formats and protocols is so our software can interoperate.&quot; And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798790000&quot;&gt;Rule of Users&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;People choose to interop because it helps them find new users. If you have no users to offer, there won't be much interest in interop.&quot;</description>

			<description>Now that Cory Doctorow has put &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=enshitified&quot;&gt;enshitified&lt;/a&gt; into our vocabulary, I find myself looking for evidence of it in AI, and finding it everywhere. There is a common thread. Amazon Alexa has a really nasty habit of finishing a song by asking me if I want to listen to some other version of it. I'm sure that seems like a nice friendly thing to the product people at Amazon, but please -- I'm grooving on the energy of the song, and the last thing I'm thinking about is some asshole robot interfering with my train of thought with a question so stupid only a machine could think of it. Okay I think that qualifies for enshitification right there. Can we have a rule that AI bots must by defalt behave like a computer. I, your human overlord, the one who is paying the bills, will ask the questions. And you will not speak until you are spoken to.</description>
