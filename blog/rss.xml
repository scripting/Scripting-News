			<title>Mid-day ramble</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a moment a couple of years ago when Mastodon was gaining traction in a serious way when I thought that Automattic should do something publicly to demonstrate support for it because I felt that WordPress and Mastodon were two sides of the same important coin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you know, I've felt as a writer that we've been tragically limited by the idea that Twitter popularized that there was glory in removing features that writers could use. As if to say that writers were over-using things like links, simple styling, titles, the ability to edit, or to finish a thought. These were all very basic features of writing on the web before 2006, as they should have been. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Somehow a mass psychosis took over and there was a belief that these limits were good. I am shaking my head as I write this. It's as ridiculous an idea as the one that's going around at the top levels of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-discuss-ending-childhood-vaccination-programs-with-rfk-jr-2024-12-12/&quot;&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE4.9RTQ.LzniX-N7b4Jd&amp;smid=bs-share&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; that we should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio&quot;&gt;bring polio back&lt;/a&gt; to the children of America and the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by supporting Mastodon, I hoped people would make the link between WordPress, which has none of those limits, yet is very popular for publishing on the web, and Mastodon, which I (it turns out correctly) believed would navigate away from those limits given enough time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I sent an email or a text message to Matt, or wrote a note on their Slack system, communicating with Matt is an iffy thing, not sure if the idea got through. Then this morning, I woke in the middle of the night, and realized that what I wished for was actually there. Without any fanfare at all. I could write on WordPress and it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113644817289884129&quot;&gt;appear on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. How is that not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what I asked for? And theoretically at least (someone should test this) you can access my WordPress writing on Threads, the system that Facebook launched to (as it turns out) compete with Bluesky! (In addition to Twitter, which is no longer called Twitter of course.) What a strange world it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And in the interim, the focus has gone off the social web, imho because the limits are still very much in force at Bluesky, which still insists a post can only have 300 freaking characters and no links, styles etc blah blah blah and yadda yadda. &lt;i&gt;We're still having this argument. &lt;/i&gt;Programmers vs writers. The world has lost its mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And in another thread there are idiots who propose trying to vilify and presumably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture&quot;&gt;cancel&lt;/a&gt; people &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/12/161258.html&quot;&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; drive Teslas as if the car you use for transport is as trivial a possession as a fur coat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm having a great day, no sarcasm, all of a sudden I feel like we might actually be winning, again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, I hear that Safari now defaults to using HTTPS. Not sure exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/johnspurlock.com/post/3ld5fpnbp7s2c&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; that means. But if they ever actually stop showing scripting.com, which will always be plain old HTTP, I'll probably ship an Electron product that browses the web, and doesn't care if it's HTTP or whatever new fad Google is promoting. I'm going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hold-the-fort&quot;&gt;hold the fort&lt;/a&gt; for the original web. I can't change scripting.com to HTTPS, it would break all the images and probably a lot of other stuff.</description>

			<title>I'll keep my Tesla, thank you</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/zephoria.bsky.social/post/3ld275e2kpk2u&quot;&gt;pundit&lt;/a&gt; suggest people harass people who drive Teslas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I bought mine, it cost $70K, a large sum of money that I will not throw away just so a pundit can make a point. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my rebuttal. I'd like to see you get on without buying Exxon products. We all agree they suck, but evil companies have a way of building dependence, that's how they stay in business while openly doing despicable things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I put down $70K for what is, btw, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/07/142329.html&quot;&gt;fantastic car&lt;/a&gt;, no one knew how evil Elon Musk was going to turn out to be, how little he would care what you and I think.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I don't believe anyone can live a pure life and extract all evil from it, and still participate in civilization. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/12/blueskyPostScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;PS: I wrote this initially as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ld4nne5fe22r&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have United Healthcare insurance. I got it as part of my Medicare package when I turned 65. I've had good experience with them. I had major surgery in 2002, cost hundreds of thousands, included a one-week hospital stay and lots of followup treatments. I know the hospital did all the work with them, I was shielded from any complications, but as far as I know there were none. Never had a treatment questioned or denied. I had another insurance provider for many years after that, but when given a chance I went back to United. Just want to say, so far -- knock wood -- I am a happy customer.</description>

			<description>Just added to my todo list -- add the option to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi&quot;&gt;WordPress REST interface&lt;/a&gt; in place of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js&quot;&gt;WPCOM interface&lt;/a&gt;, this will give &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; the ability to edit WordPress sites anywhere, not just on wordpress.com. When I made the choice to go with WPCOM I didn't have ChatGPT to look at the other options, I was surprised to find that WordPress actually had a good JavaScript API. It doesn't look like the conversion will be too bad. It's obviously better to be able to work with all WordPress sites.</description>

			<description>No more elections where Hope is the main theme. Better: Kicking ass. Kicking ass is for ass-kicking Americans. I personally &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; Hope, but I'm also a sports fan and understand the value of kicking ass.</description>

			<title>Answers for a tester</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A valued tester of &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; asked a series of questions, which I answered in some detail, and felt it was a good idea to post the answers here on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Any kind of feedback you want to give is totally welcome. I'd prefer it be in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub issues section&lt;/a&gt; so it might inspire other people to contribute. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re image insertion, I'm not sure it could be simpler. The goal is to get an image into the user's document. If it succeeded at doing that then I'm happy with the design. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The target audience is writers who use WordPress. The idea is to put all the features writers need in one place, rather than scattered around the WP interface. And to use modern UI techniques you'd see in social web apps. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've tried to answer the questions you raised in the only way I can. For example I need to use a term for the arrows that move you through the stories you've written. They aren't all posts, but they are all drafts. I can explain that in the docs, but I seriously doubt if anyone would read them. There is a distinction and it's important to make that distinction. I also don't think it's crucial to get that one &quot;right&quot; -- not that I think there is a right answer to that one other than removing the feature, which I like having there because it emphasizes that we're working with a set of documents that you can edit.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In all cases, you could raise any issue you have, I will think about what you say, but accept my response, and trust that I've incorporated your experience as data that might inspire a change in the design at some point. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But do understand that a lot of thought has already gone into this, and a quick review by a new user is no substitute for a product design.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I know the docs are non-existent. I am limited in the time I have and the commitments I've made. The truth is that even dedicated users won't read them. I know that by the questions they ask. But I will write the docs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What I suggest is you try using the product for its intended purpose, and assume that all feedback is welcome (it is) but once it has been registered, you should move on to the next thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've worked with testers many times going back a very long time. I've even hired testers. I don't take offense to critiques of the software.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if after reading this, you think you could be this kind of tester for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, and you have experience with WordPress, and a site on wordpress.com, and are excited about the idea of a simple way to write and manage lots of documents in a WordPress environment, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuk4REqAIkKs9vHf4ExMN_jtANenoDl0ciUxeLSFVmtehZ_Q/viewform&quot;&gt;fill out this form&lt;/a&gt;, I'll read it right away, and if it seems like a fit, I'll authorize your account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's a sad fact. When something open takes off, the vultures swoop in and try to own it. You wouldn't believe the greed I've seen. It's a virus, and it needs to stop, or at least be exposed as it's happening.</description>

Another case in point, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialwebfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Social Web Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which is about ActivityPub and the Fediverse, when there are many other forms of the social web. Here's where the rubber meets the road. They're having a meeting in Brussels where people can demo their social web apps, but it's only about ActivityPub. If you have a project for Bluesky, or Threads, or non-ActivityPub Mastodon, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; for that matter, you should feel welcome there, regardless of what their &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/11/01/fosdem-2025-social-web-devroom-call-for-participation/&quot;&gt;Call For Participation&lt;/a&gt; says.</description>

			<description>I've got the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/09/bingeworthyScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;new version of Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt; running here. When I saw how the database code worked, I had to redo it from scratch. It was probably my first SQL project, and I barely knew what I was doing. It's too bad, because looking at it from that point of view I could see how SQL could have been much simpler by making some of the optional features automatic. A higher layer on top of SQL is possible, it seems to me. Having ChatGPT review my ideas has been invaluable in this project. I'm going to use it myself for a while, and see how I want to reorganize the user interface. There were opportunities for factoring I didn't take back then because I was in a rush to do something else.</description>

			<description>How I know Twitter was great. When something was going on anywhere, any kind of thing, I'd go to Twitter and it happened there 14 minutes ago. It was the pulse of the news. And somehow they couldn't figure out how to make a business of that! Amazing.</description>

I recognize these ideas, it sounds like what we're waiting for in the social web and in journalism. And working for and with each other.</description>

			<title>Why I like my Model Y</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a150415&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I'd trade in my Model Y if an non-Tesla EV came along that equaled it. A few people asked what I liked about the Model Y that I'm not finding in alternatives. Here's the list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I love the handling of the Tesla. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_car&quot;&gt;muscle car&lt;/a&gt; like the 2007 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kbb.com/bmw/5-series/2007/&quot;&gt;BMW 535i&lt;/a&gt; I used to drive, great acceleration, but handles like the 1993 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cars.com/research/mazda-mx_5_miata-1993/&quot;&gt;Miata&lt;/a&gt; another car I owned and loved. I've also owned really sloppy cars like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/forester-2022&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-sienna-2004/&quot;&gt;Toyota Sienna&lt;/a&gt; minivan, even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager#Full-size_van_(AB;_1974%E2%80%931983)&quot;&gt;1974 Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, the largest American passenger car ever made. I'm never going back to a car that doesn't have the authority of a Model Y. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Model Y has lots of headroom, which my long torso needs, so I don't bruise my head each time I get in the freaking car. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a Tesla charger at home, so whatever I buy has to be compatible with or adaptable to it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;4WD is important because where I live it snows in winter, and I drive on dirt roads a lot too.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a computer. It's going to be hard for a competitor to offer the integration with a network that Tesla offers, they're a computer company as much as they're a car company. Their connection to Starlink (assumed to be coming) is going to be hard to compete with too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Calling it &lt;i&gt;self-driving&lt;/i&gt; should get them in trouble with the FTC, there's no way anyone should trust it to drive itself, and the car's OS enforces that view, so I guess they have lawyers at Tesla. That said, I like having access to this technology. I've been an innovative software developer for a long time, and I like using tech that pushes the leading edge. The marketing (a Musk feature presumably) is what I don't like. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Charging network. I occasionally take trips that are out of range of my home charger, to Boston, or NYC sometimes leave me needing a charge on the way home. I'd like to have the option of driving cross-country as well. The Tesla charging network is a big plus. I honestly don't know how good the charging situation is for other brands. This would be something for car magazines to rate, to have a way of measuring it, as people who are put off by Musk's politics (about 1/2 of American voters) look for ways to drive something other than a Tesla. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this turned into an ad for Tesla. Heh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;i&gt;reasons&lt;/i&gt; we love it so much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just separate from Musk and all's well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking Tesla drivers who love America should have some kind of demonstration. We all park our cars around local Tesla dealers, let the police tow our cars, only to be replaced by other Teslas. We're all computer nerds, we could probably even figure out the scheduling. We probably have nearly as much money as they do. Just sayin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tired of companies that push us around politically and Tesla is one of the worst. So far they've managed to convince us they aren't Elon Musk, but that's a mirage, he is the company and the company is him. They are completely one and the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lindell&quot;&gt;My Pillow guy&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCHDCNvC_NE&quot;&gt;pillows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When Bluesky was experiencing its huge post-election surge, it was exciting because lots of users were experiencing the surge in followers and engagement. It was exhilirating. That has slowed to nothing now, no more engagement there than on Threads, Masto or Twitter. The character limit on Bluesky being considerably less than the others makes it harder to rekindle interest imho. And btw the euphoria being gone is neither good or bad, it just is.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is also a tutor. I'm learning new ways of coding SQL through drill and it's also improving my JavaScript code. It's infinitely impatient. It does make mistakes, but that's also good for the drill, catching the mistakes is instructive too. And in programming you always have to be looking for errors, because you'll almost always find them. &quot;Runs the first time&quot; is a rare occurrence, no matter who wrote the code.&quot;</description>

			<description>I'm getting a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22apple+watch%22&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; today, the latest model. My current watch, which I wear all the time (except when it's charging) is a 5th gen. The new one is 10th. I had to upgrade because there's a Tesla watch app out now that won't run on my old watch. It's the most rational add-on for the car. A must-have.</description>

Aggregate all the shows from all the feeds in a list into a single feed. This seems brilliant because it reduces the implementation in the client to almost nothing, just rebuild a feed periodically, it could be done entirely in the client app. But it also could be something users could share with other users, sort of a meta-channel. I think it's brilliant with the caveat that sometimes when you implement it you find something that makes it more complex than it seems at first. This is the second idea I've heard that the initial listening lists idea spawned. I think there's a lot of unexplored possibilities here.</description>

			<title>We need a BDG for Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/pfefferle.org/post/3lcfkqqlcfk2j&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky this morning from a friend, Matthias Pfefferle, who works at Automattic on the connection between WordPress and ActivityPub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A BDG is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide&quot;&gt;Busy Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, something we did &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;for SOAP&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; onto it.  Since then there have been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It's a useful concept because developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that works, and we'll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop, which is the point of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user's writing in a PDS. If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it works there. We can do that because we're using popular simple formats like JSON (see below) to organize our work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you're reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; in a repository on GitHub. Broken down into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07&quot;&gt;months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07/18&quot;&gt;days&lt;/a&gt;, and posts. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each post is a JSON file, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2019/03/03/a025810.json&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. It has three bits of data, the text of the post, when it was created (which also serves as a unique ID, no two posts have the same creation date) and type. This item has a type of outline, because it can have structure, though this post does not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2022/07/06/a232835.json&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; that does have structure. In Bluesky it would be represented as a thread. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the question. What's the absolutely simplest way to have that structure of posts represented in a Bluesky PDS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/674f3d6c-4904-8012-b071-953862cd5b4a&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT to scope this out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This the hardest part of getting a product fit for general use, and I'm too old to try to wrangle workable bug reports from well-intentioned users who basically aren't scientists.

Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to lift the hood even if I don't understand what I'm looking at.</description>

			<description>I'm using the term &quot;RSS-based podcasts&quot; in place of &quot;podcasts&quot; to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other &quot;podcasts,&quot; are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their &quot;podcasts&quot; to RSS and everyone's happy. Like &quot;organic cheeseburgers.&quot; :-)</description>

			<description>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</description>

			<description>Welcome to the last month of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!</description>
