			<description>There's this great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mzY1sdiFSU&amp;t=53s&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; in MoneyBall where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane&quot;&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/a&gt; is talking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Justice&quot;&gt;David Justice&lt;/a&gt; in the batting cage. Justice reminds Beane how much he's paying him, and Beane says I'm going to tell it to you straight -- half your salary is being paid by the Yankees. Think about it. They're paying all that money for you to play &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; them. That's how I feel about Fox. How much will it cost to get them to STFU. Whatever it is it's worth it.</description>

			<description>If you're part of the indieweb community and work in Node.js, you should know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple package&lt;/a&gt;. It flattens the interface for the most common feed formats. It's designed to be super easy to use. Give it a URL and it returns a consistent JSON structure. More people would develop feed-using apps if they knew about this package. I just want more people to develop around feeds.&#10;</description>

I thought for sure as soon as the ideas were out they'd take off. But most people had no idea. Most big new ideas come out of developers realizing something new is possible, shipping it, refining it and getting lucky. AI is the next one, I'm absolutely sure of it. But most people, even most developers, don't see the need, don't see it as inevitable in a good way. To make a fine point, we don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; AI, we didn't need PCs or GUIs or the web. But once the masses saw the power, fun and utility, there was no turning back. The same is true of AI. I've been trying to puzzle out how this will go. How can we develop the amazing power and depth of knowledge of the machine combined with the creativity and deep yearning of humans. One thing I've learned from the year I've been doing this as a user, the machine doesn't want to do anything. Don't anthropomorphize it that way. Try having a conversation with it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/cb9c4c97-bb20-439e-a503-ed2356403b0c&quot;&gt;ask what it wants&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't understand the concept. It's not surprising that we think the machine will be like us, we always want something, we're the most selfish species there is. But we'll learn to work with the machine, I already have. We'll &lt;i&gt;evolve&lt;/i&gt; through this. That's maybe the biggest strength our species has, the rate at which we can adapt.</description>

However, as always the most interesting stuff is done by the users, especially at such an early stage in a technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past, when blogging was booting up, we had blogging itself to share information about what we were learning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcasting grew even more quickly because we already had blogging to share info on what we were trying, what worked, and what didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see all of it in the archive of Scripting News. I was liberal about what I pointed to, because sharing the ideas was more important than any one person's ideas, including my own. The downside is that it made it easy for people to claim credit for things they didn't contribute. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway with AI, I'm just using the stuff, not developing with it, at least not yet. I wouldn't know where to begin. But I'm discovering all kinds of applications every day, and writing about them on my blog, but I know there are many others doing the same, and I want to read all of it and want them to read my stuff. There's no way to find each other right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: It would be interesting to have an AI server that was ingesting our RSS feeds all the time. Then a community of bloggers, if it should develop would have a totally unique kind of archive. Who knows what we'd learn? Would anyone need to write a book about this stuff, or would we always have a current book about what's been discovered here? If you find this fascinating as I do, then I want to know more about what you're doing. See how we can bootstrap something in itself, that's the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, when I discover a blogger who is writing about using AI, I'll add it to my blogroll, which is visible on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll.social&lt;/a&gt; main page, and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. If you have such a blog, or know of a good one, send me a link, and I'll add it to the blogroll. Once there are enough, I'll start a public timeline for it in FeedLand, so everyone can benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's use our technology to track the most exciting tech development in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt; for the third time. One of the major themes of the show is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.</description>

			<description>Has anyone ever asked you, on the social web, what you think about something? Not a message to everyone to which you could reply, but a message specifically to you? I try to do it when I think of it. I find you can get really interesting ideas that way sometimes. And also it's a way spreading some love around the world, because people like to be asked what they think, I've found.</description>

			<description>I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks. I knew all the players. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin&quot;&gt;Obi Toppin&lt;/a&gt;, a former Knick we traded for some reason. That's about it for my inner fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result when I got up in the morning. That's how I like my NBA, frankly.</description>

			<description>I found a fairly painless way to transcribe voicemails using Google Docs. 1. Open a text document. 2. Choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en&quot;&gt;Voice Typing&lt;/a&gt; from the Tools menu. 3. Play the voice memo over the speaker of your iPhone. 4. That's it. Google transcribes it into your document. It would be better if Apple offered that as an option in the Share menu, but they don't.</description>

			<title>Why Tesla FSD is unsafe</title>

I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as &quot;self-driving,&quot; which it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9&quot;&gt;Kia EV9&lt;/a&gt;, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romeokia.com/&quot;&gt;Kia dealer&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York&quot;&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt; which is practically in the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. &quot;show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.&quot; Like that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

It should be as easy to block someone as it is to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.</description>

			<description>Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season&quot;&gt;starts all over again&lt;/a&gt;. With love for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&amp;t=315s&quot;&gt;heart of gold&lt;/a&gt; team. Either way we win, imho. I know you're not supposed to feel that way, but that's how I feel right now. During the game, if we're losing, based on recent experience I won't like that so much. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>This blog is becoming a ChatGPT blog the same way when it started it was all about the web. I'd love to get pointers to other blogs whose content is largely about ChatGPT, so we can systematize learning about what we all are discovering. I think that blogs and ChatGPT are going to go together just like Google search and blogs did when search was booting up. Bloggers (not all of us, but some) provide good material for bootstraps. We just need to hook up blogs to social web, which is what I'm working on this year.</description>

			<description>Just tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/&quot;&gt;perplexity.ai&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Everyone's been raving about it. I asked it a question I asked ChatGPT in working on the RSS feeds for my current project. &quot;Suppose I had an RSS feed for a WordPress blog, and I wanted to include the id's of the site and post in the &amp;lt;item&gt; for each post. Is there a standard way to do this? If not, is there a namespace defined for WordPress blogs that might provide some prior art?&quot; Both were able to get me all the info I wanted, and answered follow-up questions. Perplexity got there sooner. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perplexity.ai/search/suppose-i-had-axAhbuSgS2mD_JSQcj9qLA&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C7E4900JP2a&quot;&gt;On Threads&lt;/a&gt; I posted this question to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conference-board.org/bio/frank-shaw&quot;&gt;Frank X Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, a PR exec at Microsoft, who I've known for at least 30 years. &quot;Wouldn't it be great if there was a social web toolkit with the basic building blocks so we could experiment with different UI and behaviors. Why, after so many years are we still so controlled. When did we give up?&quot; I think you can do the design with words and dialogs, btw. Here's a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/18/facebookDialog.png&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; for keeping threads focused and civil on Facebook. You can limit comments to people who have a stake in being on good terms with the author.

			<description>A few weeks ago I asked ChatGPT if it could transcribe an M4A audio file, the kind of file that Apple's voice memo app produces, and it said no, it couldn't do that. I gave it another try today and got a different answer. I uploaded the file, and it came close, it said it needed the file in WAV format. It gave me instructions for writing a desktop tool that would do the conversion. I expect in another couple of weeks they'll be able to deal with the M4A file directly.</description>

			<description>I think it would be really cool to have the voice interface for ChatGPT available on Amazon Echo. I kind of doubt that Amazon would want to do that. Alexa is nice, but really weak compared to ChatGPT.</description>

			<description>Do people understand the impact ChatGPT can have on how we control our software? No more hunting through menus among a thousand options to figure out how to do something. Just use natural human language. The UIs we've had to design and live with will be a thing of the past. Yet no one seems to be talking about this. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/9fe427a0-43b4-4f34-a830-39fdb4cdba37&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I've been trying to get transcripts of my voicemail, as easily as possible. In that example, it shows me how to do a variety of things. I kept asking if it could do it for me, all the way up to making a feature request of the developers at OpenAI. At some point they'll be able to add an item to my calendar, or make a feature request for me. That's the whole point of computers. They can do things for you. We call this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/24.html#a124347&quot;&gt;paving cow paths&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Most of the news stories about AI are bullshit by people who clearly have not attempted to understand what its capabilities are. This is the real thing folks. Amazing breakthroughs are happening every freaking day. So much improvement and so much potential. How do I know, because in comments on social media, people parrot the bullshit, like they always do. Journalism is still hugely influential, and they are dishonest, lazy, self-interested bordering on narcissism, and very very dangerous. We need to re-form journalism as if our continued existence depends on it.</description>

			<title>Knicks update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: For the 80,000th time -- the Knicks suck!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;All the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html&quot;&gt;funny farting&lt;/a&gt; didn't make a difference last night. The Knicks were &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-playoffs-pacers-lock-down-knicks-to-force-game-7-030512562.html&quot;&gt;blown out&lt;/a&gt;, again (sigh), by the Indiana team. My dear friend NakedJen texted me from Oklahoma of all places (I don't know how she got there, or why, she must be on her way to some other place, maybe Dallas?) that the Knicks are trying to kill her. Sums it up perfectly. I gave myself leave after the first few minutes of the fourth quarter, seeing where this thing was going. I went to bed, and knew that when I woke up there would be a Game 7 at the Garden on Sunday (3:30PM Eastern). I'm not sure how I feel about that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The odds are probably pretty good that the Knicks will win that game, but maybe they should just let it go, and we can pick this up again in October. By then all the injured players should be back, and maybe there will be an incredible new free agent signed over the summer, so we're not so dependent on one superstar, who is great, but has off nights, like last night. Why didn't he let any other Knicks try to fill in for him, when he's double teamed that means someone is open. I was screaming at the TV during the game, let someone someone else shoot dammit! Oh my gods. I hate game 7's when my team is in the game. I don't mind it if other people's teams are in a death match like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

How incredibly insulting. It's just like what Trump says about Jewish Americans being loyal to Israel. Such an un-American idea. We all got here different ways. Some for a better life, some for life at all, others as slaves. But the United States is a big-hearted idea -- the &lt;i&gt;United&lt;/i&gt; States. It's unfortunate that such a small-minded &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;united person is so powerful now. We still have a long way to go.</description>

			<description>Here's something that matters. Somehow ChatGPT gets the story right about my various contributions. You'll see all kinds of BS in Wikipedia and other various highly rated sites. Somehow ChatGPT sees through the bullshit, and usually gets the story right. So when people say that human reporting is better than machine reporting, I think this may be one of those cases where conventional wisdom is wrong. The human record is relatively easy to manipulate if the researchers are lazy and/or dishonest.</description>

			<title>Google and The Innovator's Dilemma in 2024</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's overwhelming how much ground Google has to cover to get AI into all their products, but that's what they think they have to do, and I more or less agree. They feel they have to because their main product, search, is threatened by ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/17/innovatorsDilemma.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/5ab4f305-0d0d-4cba-b7d7-0b5debf06a6c&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma&quot;&gt;Innovator's Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;  in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation-dp-1633691780/dp/1633691780/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; published in 1997. It's why Netscape was able to undermine Microsoft when the web came out. Microsoft had a huge beast they had to move, Windows, and all its apps, and while they had a hardcore, scrappy and rich culture, they couldn't overcome the inertia that comes from being dug in, with their cannons pointed at the already-vanquished IBM, not the upstarts that came from the VCs in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and the rest of the PC industry had written off Unix, but there it was, again -- ugly as ever, but with networking that really worked and was easy, and the users wanted networking even though Microsoft wanted them to want Office. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google did the same with AI. As did Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. They had AI projects, and used AI in limited areas, as did Microsoft with Unix in the early 90s. But they couldn't bet everyting on it like a startup can. Now they have to. But the they don't have the tools needed to fight the new war. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; the dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the toughest corner any tech company has to turn, but there is an approach that could work for Google. Their strength is distribution. They have all the users. They can take a product that's ready for the world to market in a day. But they can't develop it. You can't snap your fingers and have a good new UI for every one of their products, ready in a year, although they will try as MS tried to adapt Office to the web. They don't have the right people or corporate culture to do that. Instead you have to hope you can find a great bootstrapping startup outside to work with, and use their strength as a distributor to help them. This is what I recommended for Microsoft in the 1990s, and I think I was vindicated, it would have imho worked a lot better than the path they chose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But now, their third time around this loop, Microsoft has learned! With their OpenAI partnership they've done exactly what I recommended in the 90s. They still have to convert all the old software and their user interfaces around the new capabilities, but at least they also own a share of a bootstrap that's now booming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I am blessed to have lived long enough now to have been part of now six different rearrangements like this. I love that we have now gotten there again. There's absolutely no doubt now, imho. The six rearrangements -- minis, PCs, GUIs, web, Napster, and now AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is all my opinion, and from the polls I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/16.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, it's obvious that many of the people within earshot don't agree or have seen the light yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The thing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;Casey Newton predicts&lt;/a&gt; for Google and news has already happened for the huge base of reference info and know-how for software development. We no longer go to the sources, don't need to, the ChatGPT version is an order of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into the AI database. We're going somewhere here. It's worth going there, imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the now and near-future. But it's as big a step as the move to PCs, then GUIs, the web, mobile.</description>

I'd like to create a notebook of info I'd like it to have available for people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that sometimes don't make it into the docs. But when I'm working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine, my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow pre-digest it. I wish I had a panel of experts about this stuff, but I guess they'd have to be human, at least at this point in time. If this makes sense to you and you know how to get started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/307&quot;&gt;post a note here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
