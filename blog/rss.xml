			<description>The United States is Russia's 51st state, sad to say. Let's get it back for the people of the United States. We don't like Putin. Sorry.</description>

			<description>Before our media was gradually taken over by Russia, they did it to Ukraine, but they managed to dig their way out, had a democratic election, resulting in their current government. So it's not impossible to dig your way out. But you have to stop insisting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/07/letHitlerSpeak.png&quot;&gt;Hitler be allowed&lt;/a&gt; to speak.</description>

			<description>The Fediverse is impossible to use even for people who understand what it's trying to do, and most people have no idea. The answer: &lt;b&gt;Stop trying to reinvent Twitter&lt;/b&gt;. It wasn't a great idea! And figure out what really works in a decentralized system. It requires some serious brain work.</description>

			<title>Tech and democracy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/&quot;&gt;TechDirt piece&lt;/a&gt; by Mike Masnick about being a democracy blog disturbing because imho it should have been about democracy at least since 2017, when it was clear that Twitter had just elected a president of the United States. That was a clear strong signal that tech and democracy were tightly connected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the time I tried to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;raise the alarm&lt;/a&gt;, in tech and in finance, that a Republican could buy Twitter for $12B, and that was a cheap price considering the value of the presidency in a tech entrepreneur's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My experience in Silicon Valley goes back to the late 70s, so I have a pretty good understanding of the personality of tech entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, has been about democracy since &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;inception&lt;/a&gt;, in 1994, though it has primarily been about technology. I got the same complaints that I should stick to tech, but I didn't see a line of separation. The stakes were large then, but now they're much larger and as Masnick notes, impossible to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-90s there was not much of a debate whether the First Amendment applied to the web, the consensus was that it did not! The NYT didn't defend the 1st A on the web, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;Congress passed a law&lt;/a&gt; saying the 1st A didn't apply and a Democratic president, Clinton, signed the law. That was a pretty clear signal. (We were saved by a Federal appeals court, otherwise who knows what we'd be doing now.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In tech, every generation thinks they're seeing a problem for the first time. This is almost never true. It's like anything else, we're iterative, going over the same issues again and again, and we have a chance to wake up at any point and learn from our mistakes and not repeat the previous cycle, but it seems we never do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most important is that we &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt; and share what we learned. But first you have to be aware that there is history. You know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/634544-those-who-cannot-remember-the-past-are-condemned-to-repeat&quot;&gt;famous line&lt;/a&gt; about people who &quot;cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have great historians working here, and TechDirt is more famous than Scripting News is now. It would be a shame if the historians overlooked the historic connection between tech and democracy because they weren't aware it was documented much earlier than 2025. And btw -- don't miss that &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google et al&lt;/a&gt; would like to deprecate the archive of the early web. No one is paying attention to that problem, and it's another way history is lost. The wisdom of the Google people forcing this on the rest of us is very much like the DOGE bros in DC today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People who criticize Dems for weak opposition at the SOTU are not hypocrites only if they said before the event what they would do. I was glad not to have to choose. I think in the end they did what made sense to each one individually. The range of response by the Dems was much broader than the Repubs. We should be thankful they haven't capitulated, as so many have, esp in what we used to think of as journalism.</description>

			<description>The single most important thing about what Musk is doing is that it is Musk that is doing it. Not elected, not accountable to anyone, and the only way we know what he's doing is from the aftermath. We play no role in his choices. Plus, he would be our last choice if we were in the market for a crazy despot to ruin our country. He wasn't born or educated here, and thus has very little idea of who we are and thus what the people he's firing do.</description>

			<description>Idea for SNL. A special episode of Law and Order where the cops arrest someone for being disrespectful to Trump,. The prosecutors debate among themselves if they have to do this, no one quits, they don't feel good about it but they prosecute, being assured by the District Attorney it's the right thing to do. When there are objections judge rules in favor of the government most of the time, but wants to show balance so once or twice rules in favor of the defense, but it doesn't matter, when the judge gives instructions to the jury he says basically the only option is to convict, or so it seems that's what he's saying and dutifully, the jury convicts. There are sentencing standards, provided by the DOJ so the judge sentences the accused to life at hard labor. Back in the studio at 30 Rock the audience isn’t sure if they should laugh, slowly realizing it’s not meant to be funny, the skit fades out to a commercial break.</description>

			<title>The best revenge is none</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/14997571.Pamela_Short&quot;&gt;Pamela Short&lt;/a&gt;: The best revenge is none. Heal yourself, forgive, move on and don't become like those who hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a pragmatic reason for this. I found, when I was young and didn't know better, that getting revenge didn't just hurt the target, it also left me with a deep pain. When I did something to another person I was also doing it to myself. I found that the dark cloud of my harmful behavior would stay with me for a long time, maybe never going away. I would find it hard to forgive myself for what I did. So it's better to not try to get revenge, and let the pain of being hurt dissipate on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a story to go with that. In the beginning of RSS, I had a partner and customer ask me at lunch if there were any circumstances when I would take the server we ran for them off the air. I said that's a weird question, but of course not. The very next day, his team announced they were taking over RSS, completely changing it, and the first I heard of it was in the public announcement. Later that same day, my brain boiling over in anger at being treated so poorly, I did eventually land on the idea of just taking his server offline. And then I laughed that he knew I'd get to that, and wanted to plant a little marker there for whatever reason, I don't know. But no I didn't take his server off the air. He may be a bastard, but he did pay for the service so his server stays up. And two years later, his project a failure, I came out with RSS 2.0 and that was the end of that. It wasn't revenge, it was just picking up the ball in the playground and restarting the game that they had caused to stop. We went on and RSS did a lot of good work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
