If you do that you can say you are &quot;of the web.&quot; If we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; do that always, voila! -- no more silos. Another rule is that you must use an existing format if it exists, because then you will interop with apps that support that format. Gratuitous incompatibility is a sign of a silo-seeker. So, look first, if there are no usable formats, make your app and make your format public.</description>

			<title>Wikipedia and AI will/should merge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT: &quot;When movies were new there was probably a bit of rage from stage performers — why would people pay for live shows when for a fraction of the cost they can see the same show performed by artificial actors?&quot; There was a lot &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/699f05dd-f740-8012-8228-e7a50b76c16a&quot;&gt;to say&lt;/a&gt; about this, it turns out. This was before any of us were born. I remember that PCs were supposed to put a lot of people out of work, and I suppose they did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/07/davesautomatedwebster.html&quot;&gt;strike paper&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco in 1994 to protect the jobs of people who drive the trucks that delivered the news for the Chronicle and Examiner. Ironically, we, the strike paper, published on the web. I was in it for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/11/moonMissions.html&quot;&gt;moon mission&lt;/a&gt; aspect -- we needed to get a website on the air quickly, and I had never made a website before. The management also had a strike paper, also a website, and we worked with them, because I guess our actual mission was to figure out how to get the news on the web. Are fewer people employed because of this? Hard to answer, but I guess the SF newspapers aren't delivered by truck in 2026. But does it matter? Could anyone have stopped it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep coming back to this, I'd like to use an AI-managed Wikipedia. Its human-edited system was an innovation in the early days of the web, but it has serious flaws that can now be addressed with AI. Keep a set of pages current with the best information available over time that tell a true story, not serve as a PR agency for people who pay for the story they want told. That is a problem the AI services can solve today, and I would have a lot more confidence in the accuracy of what we get. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A great example is RSS. Wikipedia thinks it's about a format. I think the story is news. How RSS became a standard in the news world and the blogging world at the same time. That turned out to be significant. We, the people who want news, were gifted a great start, thanks to the creativity and generosity of the NY TImes who helped get the ball rolling in the news industry. Last time I checked they weren't even mentioned in the Wikipedia story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the story of RSS isn't over. Finally after 20 years of stagnation, we're about to get new tools that work better and differently (new ideas!), and they will make it easier (even possible) for individual developers to enter the market, without trying to fit in with the billionaire silo overlords. And of course, a lot of this burst of energy is due to ChatGPT and its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you see new interesting software, give AI some of the credit for that too. And going back to the beginning of this story, there were a few really great movies produced after the initial shock of the new technology. And what of the future beyond the AI of 2026? Seriously, no one knows what comes next. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Ironically, we, the strike paper, published on the web. I was in it for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/11/moonMissions.html&quot;&gt;moon mission&lt;/a&gt; aspect -- we needed to get a website on the air quickly, and I had never made a website before. The management also had a strike paper, also a website, and we worked with them, because I guess our actual mission was to figure out how to get the news on the web. Are fewer people employed because of this? Hard to answer, but I guess the SF newspapers aren't delivered by truck in 2026. But does it matter?

				<source:outline text="I keep coming back to this, I'd like to use an AI-managed Wikipedia. Its human-edited system was an innovation in the early days of the web, but it has serious flaws that can now be addressed with AI. Keep a set of pages current with the best information available over time that tell a true story, not serve as a PR agency for people who pay for the story they want told. That is a problem the AI services can solve today, and I would have a lot more confidence in the accuracy of what we get." created="Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:24:36 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2026/02/25/144432.html#a142436"/>
				<source:outline text="A great example is RSS. Wikipedia thinks it's about a format. I think the story is news. How RSS became a standard in the news world and the blogging world at the same time. That turned out to be significant. We, the people who want news, were gifted a great start, thanks to the creativity and generosity of the NY TImes who helped get the ball rolling in the news industry.

				<source:outline text="And the story of RSS isn't over. Finally after 20 years of stagnation, we're about to get new tools that work better and differently (new ideas!), and they will make it easier (even possible) for individual developers to enter the market, without trying to fit in with the billionaire silo overlords. And of course, a lot of this burst of energy is due to ChatGPT and its competitors." created="Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:47:53 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2026/02/25/144432.html#a144753"/>

Why not do something that visibly makes people's lives better now, and makes money. People are pretty nervous about AI. And so far you have to be a scientist of some kind to really appreciate it.

			<title>The web builds on the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I designed podcasting, I could have invented a better way to record and play radio shows, but MP3 already existed, as did recording and playback hardware and software, so it was the no-brainer choice. No one ever asked why we are using MP3. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;TBL did it when he designed how text would work in the web. He used the same model as WP software on PCs and Macs. Before that, the word processors did it the same way they did it on typewriters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons it works this way. I didn't fully understand that until I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv9TFPMO6pk&quot;&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; and why it can't go back and correct mistakes. You must always build on what's already there. A lot of tech people butt up against that, esp if they work at big companies with tech-intimidated management. That bet is, in my experience, always a loser. The web builds on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't invent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look at the first sentence of the first paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When I &lt;i&gt;designed&lt;/i&gt; podcasting, I could have &lt;i&gt;invented&lt;/i&gt; a better way to record and play radio shows.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I chose not to invent, because invention isn't what the web is about. It's about reusing parts for new purposes. That's how you build anything. Imagine you wanted to build a skyscraper in Manhattan, but first you have to destroy the city. The thought is ridiculous. Yet people come along, all the time, proposing to do the same in networks. That's why the VCs said RSS is Dead. It was really their wish, not a fact. Even poor undefended RSS kicked their ass because many millions of people use it. Maybe billions? You have to build around reality, not your dream.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's so much work going on in RSS nowadays, every day something new. I think there will soon be a network that's like nothing you've ever used and open to repurposing, but better in some ways (texcasting will work in this space) and probably there will be things from Twitter that won't work here. Centralization does have advantages. But we can have a much wider variety of ways to communicate building only on the web. Just like there are trucks and cars and bikes, and EVs all riding on the same roads. We'll try out new ideas. And you won't need a huge team of developers or millions of dollars of investment to try a new idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of you don't know what it's like to be there at the birth of a new medium. I want everyone to have that experience. And to have a place in developing it. The key is working together. The web forces that. People who make exclusive products should never claim to be of the web.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am going to try again to open up the editing side of OPML. It's gotten pretty famous in RSS-land, but people don't know there are editors for OPML, and some which work pretty well with subscription lists, and could be made to work even better.

			<description>They all say podcasting‘s open period is over and one or another huge billionaire-owned platform is the new owner of podcasting. This time it's YouTube. How many times has this happened? Many. But not enough for journalism to respect the power of the people. So here we go again.</description>

I once said no one wants that (referring to Pagemaker) just shows how little I know. There are good reasons to believe that one product saved the Mac and Apple.</description>

			<description>Just noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ranchero.com/2026/02/17/new-rss-reader-current.html&quot;&gt;Brent mentioned FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; (my own product) that does things differently. Thank you. I don't read most of the pieces that come in via RSS. I scroll through the updates, and if something catches my eye, I stop, read the first part, and then if my interest continues, I read the rest. That's the way I've always read news, going back to the kitchen table at my childhood home where we subscribed to the NY Times, print edition (this was long before the web) and we all sat around the table in the morning reading it and telling each other what we found. News isn't like email. But FeedLand does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ffeed%2Fall%2F&quot;&gt;mailbox reader&lt;/a&gt;, patterned after Brent's NetNewsWire (only steal from the best). There are times when that's what you want. And mostly I wanted to thank Brent for the mention. BTW, that's not the only new idea in FeedLand. Let's get to know each others' products. That's one of the mistakes we made last time -- thinking each of our products was a self-contained universe. We are part of a community that grew from the web. So by definition we are all just part of a very big world. All our products work together, and to preserve that we as people must all &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt; too.</description>

			<title>The Spurlocks of RSS-Land</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a product announcement from Jake Spurlock -- a new feed reader called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakespurlock.com/2026/02/today-comes-to-the-mac/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;. From the description sounds well-thought-out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He explains -- &quot;Google killed Reader in 2013. I've been chasing that feeling ever since. So I built it.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also know someone named &lt;i&gt;John&lt;/i&gt; Spurlock, who I &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22john%20spurlock%22&quot;&gt;worked on&lt;/a&gt; some OPML and RSS stuff for Bluesky in 2023. I sent a note of congrats to him, when I really should've sent it to Jake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/18/spurlockScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the conversation I had with ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And text of the email I sent congratulating the wrong Spurlock.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the new product!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Haven't tried it yet, I don't generally use Apple's store on my Mac, not sure why. I will do it though.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your product looks nice and well-thought out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And there are some ways we could work together now that I think you'll find interesting, like using FeedLand to get you instant updates based on rssCloud, assuming you haven't figured out how to support it from a client. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also OPML subscriptions are nice too. Another thing I'd like to get going, and need someone to work with on to make it happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I wonder if they're related? Have they met each other? Do they know of the havoc they are bringing to the formerly simple world of RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20171005153425/http://forewordbootstrap.blorkmark.com/&quot;&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bootstrap-Responsive-Development-Jake-Spurlock/dp/1449343910&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; Jake Spurlock wrote for O'Reilly about the Bootstrap Toolkit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If they start spending more money than a subscription costs, you could offer a subscription then, as a way to save money. Kind of the way Amazon lets you buy a certain amount of coffee beans without requiring you to sign up for monthly delivery. They do tell you how much you'd save if you subscribed.

It's much easier to write utility scripts, where the user writes the code for themselves. That is very possible, esp if you use a scripting language created for it, and the AI bots are really good at that, they speak the same language we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But to make something easy to use by humans, I think you actually have to be a human. I've found I'm not very good at creating software that isn't for me. And I've been practicing this almost every day for over fifty freaking years. (I think freaking is the proper adjective in this situation). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Scaling which everyone says is hard is actually something a chatbot does quite easily imho -- because you just have to store all your data in a relational database, you can't use the local file system. That's all there is to it. They try to make it sound mysterious (the old priesthood at work) but it is actually very simple. It's so easy even ChatGPT can do it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know this must sound like the stuff reporters say about bloggers, but in this case it's true. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An anectdote -- I used to live in Woodside CA where a lot of the VCs live, and we'd all eat breakfast at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buckswoodside.com/&quot;&gt;Buck's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant, and around the time Netscape open sourced their browser code, the VCs were buzzing because they wouldn't have to pay for software, they'd just market the free stuff.

			<title>New RSS feature from Manton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I asked Manton Reece if he could add a feature that gave me a feed of replies to me on his service, micro.blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I post a lot of stuff to micro.blog via my linkblog RSS feed. Every one of those items can be commented on. But unless I visit micro.blog regularly, I don't see the comments. I guess people have mostly figured out that I'm an absent poster, and don't say anything. Even so, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; some replies. Wouldn't it be great if the responses could show up in my blogroll. And of course if there was an RSS feed of the replies, I would see them when I was looking for something possibly interesting, one of the main reasons I have a blogroll, and keep finding new uses for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The feed is &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/16/blogrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; now, I'm subscribed and new comments are posted in the feed and Murphy-willing I will see them.  &lt;i&gt;Bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/feeds/dave/mentions.xml&quot;&gt;https://micro.blog/feeds/dave/mentions.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a killer feature for sure. But the best part of it is this -- here are two developers working together. This is how the web works when it's working. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW a suggestion. Right now the title on my feed is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Micro.blog - dave mentions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a problem in the limited horizontal space in the blogroll. A more useful title would be: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;dave&quot; mentions on micro.blog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you were building a social network out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; this would be an essential feature. It also validates Manton's intuition to allow people like me to be absentee publishers to his community. But the missing piece was allowing the conversation to be two-way, which it now is. That deserves another &lt;i&gt;bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
