			<description>The thing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;Casey Newton predicts&lt;/a&gt; for Google and news has already happened for the huge base of reference info and know-how for software development. We no longer go to the sources, don't need to, the ChatGPT version is an order of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into the AI database. We're going somewhere here. It's worth going there, imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the now and near-future. But it's as big a step as the move to PCs, then GUIs, the web, mobile.</description>

I'd like to create a notebook of info I'd like it to have available for people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that sometimes don't make it into the docs. But when I'm working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine, my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow pre-digest it. I wish I had a panel of experts about this stuff, but I guess they'd have to be human, at least at this point in time. If this makes sense to you and you know how to get started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/307&quot;&gt;post a note here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>My AI bot is a library, a librarian, a programming partner, tutor and executive assistant. And we're just getting started working together.</description>

I'm discovering new significance for it every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be simple from the user's point of view, and in order for it to work technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It's a tall order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I'm confident I've covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press release? If you want to understand a new technology, don't talk to the CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are whirlwinds, they don't have time or the capacity to understand how big the idea is, they just know that it is big. If you want to understand you have to use it and you have to talk with other users.</description>

They say that turning off the ad blocker will &quot;support&quot; them. No, I don't think it actually will do anything for them. It might expose me to malware or having my interests shared with businesses who will use that info for who-knows-what. Much better would be to let me click a button to give them $0.50 to read the freaking article that's behind that idiotic dialog, and btw, the payment would have to be anonymous or I'm clicking the Back button. I really did want to know what happens if Trump is found guilty and sentenced to prison. I still do. But I don't think I'm going to turn off my ad blocker. I'll think about it. In the meantime if they had let me pay them $0.50 to read the freaking article, I might have linkblogged it to people who follow me via RSS or email, or on Bluesky or Mastodon, thus giving them a chance to sell others on paying $0.50 to read the freaking article. Not promising I'd do that, but if they really answer the question, if I really learn something I certainly would pass it along. Come on USA Today, get conscious. We'll happily support you for giving us info we wanted, just let us actually help you in a meaningful way, not by penalizing us for having the audacity to use an ad blocker.</description>

			<description>Yesterday's OpenAI big press event was a nothing burger. I thought they already had all of that stuff, they certainly had been at least telegraphing it. Also there never will be another Steve Jobs, it's too bad everyone is using his template for product announcements. It only works if you're Steve Jobs.</description>

			<description>BTW, I've been to three &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote&quot;&gt;Stevenotes&lt;/a&gt;, the first one, the rollout of the Mac  in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in 1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.</description>

He's a better speaker than either of the other candidates. If he didn't a speech impediment I'd say he was basically a sure thing. I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where &quot;future&quot; is less than a year away.</description>

			<title>Brunson as bad man or decoy</title>

I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season&quot;&gt;bench players&lt;/a&gt;, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been trying the new 4o version of ChatGPT. It's much faster. It certainly is a search engine. And it covers news. I asked it about Michael Cohen's testimony today in the Trump trial, and it gave me a summary. I asked for the weather forecast in Kingston NY. It wouldn't give me the lyrics to Martha My Dear by the Beatles. I asked it to draw a weather map of the mid-Atlantic states, but it drew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/13/205122.html&quot;&gt;usual garbage&lt;/a&gt; for technical images.</description>

			<description>Here's where we're headed now that we have AI programming partners. Creating software will be possible the way popular music is created. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt; was the Beatles sherpa, the same way my AI partner is my guide through unknown programming lands. It now doesn't matter if I have less experience building MySQL apps than others. I have the collective experience of &lt;i&gt;all of them&lt;/i&gt; here to help. My George Martin. What got me thinking about this is John Naughton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/11/chatgpt-ai-will-co-pilot-coders-to-new-heights-of-creativity?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about AI and programming.</description>

The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</description>

			<title>The NYT runs on freedom and apparently they don't know that</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a hard idea to get across, but there's nothing wrong with a news organization favoring things they depend on to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, a news org that covers San Jose, CA is entitled to favor San Jose. It's okay for them to do things that help San Jose in competition with other cities. They could sponsor a food drive for the neediest in their community. It wouldn't be a conflict of interest, because it's understood that they have an interest in the success of San Jose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A columnist that covers the NY Mets can be happy when the Mets win the World Series, and sad when they don't. This is not an integrity issue, or something they need to disclose, unless it's not obvious that they cover the Mets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that sense, every news org in the United States depends on the First Amendment, so it can be assumed they're in favor of democracy, because without it they couldn't exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why the editor of the NYT's statement about not favoring democracy is so ridiculous. He can't be objective about that, because the existence of his organization depends on the continuation of democracy in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whether he knows it or not, he's against Trump and in favor of the Democrats in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's hard to see what's totally obvious. Ask a fish about water and they'll say there is no such thing. Same with free speech and the NYT. They are a product of free speech, without it, it makes no sense, doesn't work. But that's been true forever, so it feels like a given, but it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's a bridge too far for many people. In other words, your understanding of feeds (RSS, Atom, etc) can be of service to others. And by collecting useful sources of news, maybe even insightful ones, we can help upgrade the quality of news we all get. The first step is to learn how to use FeedLand, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md&quot;&gt;it's pretty easy&lt;/a&gt;, esp if you already understand feeds. And with categories and OPML subscription lists, you can organize your feed reading everywhere, not just in FeedLand.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.co/company/press/archive/openai-partnership&quot;&gt;StackExchange and OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; have made a deal. I used to use StackExchange all the time, now I never do, ChatGPT is much better. There's a lot of anxiety out there, it seems but this is like shutting the barn door after the horse has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close_the_stable_door_after_the_horse_has_bolted&quot;&gt;bolted&lt;/a&gt;. There was a time when StackExchange was a godsend for programmers. But that time has passed. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. I was trying to figure out why some ancient code wasn't working. I never understood how it worked, and now I had to figure out what was going wrong. So I debugged it, carefully, step by step, with ChatGPT. It's as if I was working with another programmer who had read and fully understood every StackExchange message, and was willing to work with me for no pay to get to the bottom of the problem. This is what we call disruption. It's a whole new level of programming.

I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134&quot;&gt;Voice Memo app&lt;/a&gt; to take notes while I'm programming. Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an &lt;i&gt;edited&lt;/i&gt; version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end). I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/&quot;&gt;$AAPL&lt;/a&gt; is depressed because the lack of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html&quot;&gt;AI story&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a use that every stock trader will understand immediately. Huge value. I'm sure others are doing it. But Apple has the high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I've owned a bunch of Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and I'm right.)</description>

Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an &lt;i&gt;edited&lt;/i&gt; version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end). I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/&quot;&gt;$AAPL&lt;/a&gt; is depressed because the lack of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html&quot;&gt;AI story&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a use that every stock trader will understand immediately. Huge value. I'm sure others are doing it. But Apple has the high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I've owned a bunch of Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and I'm right.)" created="Wed, 08 May 2024 14:36:05 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2024/03/28/juggler.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/05/08.html#a143605"/>

			<description>Now that I have my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; as a regular feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, I am able to keep current with more bloggers. It's actually much more than a blogroll, it's a feed reader. When a feed that I'm following updates, it moves to the top of the list. And if I want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/08/blogrollscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;see what's new&lt;/a&gt;, I just click on the wedge next to its name to reveal the most recent five posts. From there, I can get to the full post by clicking on the permalink. If you want to get a feel for it without taking the plunge yourself, you can leave my blog open in a browser tab. You'll get exactly what I get.</description>

			<description>BTW, I was struck that famous editor and writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@semaforben@threads.net&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; said he was ashamed at starting out as a blogger, on an MSNBC show hosted by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough&quot;&gt;true hack&lt;/a&gt;. The quote was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who like me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303&quot;&gt;cross-posts&lt;/a&gt; to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it. My comment: &quot;I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. What’s wrong with people?&quot; Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Cross-posting in 2024</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called &quot;legacy.&quot; The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The items in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I want broader distribution, I do this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open a new browser window.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I write some text into the Twitter tab.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Paste an image if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see one of these support the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I support the students</title>

I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Random RSS &amp; ActivityPub notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, &quot;they don't really mean it.&quot; This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage&quot;&gt;umbrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt; of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a &quot;standard&quot; and thus was born Atom. My opinion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;one way is better&lt;/a&gt; than two, and they should have jumped on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to do that. It isn't going away. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. &quot;I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.&quot; I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1&quot;&gt;ChatGPT gave&lt;/a&gt; what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; is a product of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut&quot;&gt;Architecture Astronauts&lt;/a&gt;. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521&quot;&gt;need a BDG asap&lt;/a&gt;, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical &quot;busy developer.&quot; I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5&quot;&gt;you can't lie to a compiler&lt;/a&gt; axiom. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
