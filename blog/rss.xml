			<title>Bluesky feature request</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky devs.. How about a compromise. Support inbound RSS. Let me enter the URL of an RSS feed in settings. I'll ping a fixed location when the feed updates. Would allow the same flow to go to other systems. This would help a lot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Imagine a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any blogging tool that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that could be created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.) &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood basis for interop. It's a brilliant competitive move, if they really intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their competitors to follow suit. I don't doubt that Mastodon would do it. And Threads might even do it if they're feeling competitive with Bluesky. They've already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that's been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should take a small fraction of the time to adapt.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn't be tremendously surprised if they actually did it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Feedback on sez.us sign up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why I haven't created an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sez.us/&quot;&gt;sez.us&lt;/a&gt; yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info later, after I've created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to the next screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then they ask for my phone number. That's when I hit the back button. I already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren't good there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don't mind providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up front.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also I don't like white on black letters. It's hard for me to read. All the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an option if it's important to you, but please default to black on white.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer asked&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.</description>

If it's bought by someone who wants to use it the way Musk has, they can, without any recourse by the users. As they said in the old days, if you're getting something for free, you're the product, not the customer. We helped Musk build a way to excercise political power against our interests. You may think Bluesky is a way of fixing that, but it probably isn't. They're digging a deep hole, probably too deep to climb out of at this point. They did some innovative stuff, perhaps. But they ended up at the same place, it appears, as Twitter did.</description>

They campaigned in a new way that the Dems apparently didn't notice (neither did I, not claiming to be better). Repubs were more creative and improvisational. They didn't worry what Jake Tapper or Ezra Klein would think, so came off as more genuine. It's a TV show, acting and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&quot;&gt;suspension of disbelief&lt;/a&gt; are what count. It has nothing to do with anything else. Sorry it has to be that way but that's how it is. I don't think they hate women btw, they would have voted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr&quot;&gt;Roseanne Barr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Melissa McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock&quot;&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt;, they probably would have &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith&quot;&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy&quot;&gt;Idiocracy&lt;/a&gt; was incredibly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=prescient&quot;&gt;prescient&lt;/a&gt;.

			<source:outline text="Why Repubs won? They campaigned in a new way that the Dems apparently didn't notice (neither did I, not claiming to be better). Repubs were more creative and improvisational. They didn't worry what Jake Tapper or Ezra Klein would think, so came off as more genuine. It's a TV show, acting and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&quot;&gt;suspension of disbelief&lt;/a&gt; are what count. It has nothing to do with anything else. Sorry it has to be that way but that's how it is. I don't think they hate women btw, they would have voted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr&quot;&gt;Roseanne Barr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Melissa McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock&quot;&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt;, they probably would have &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith&quot;&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy&quot;&gt;Idiocracy&lt;/a&gt; was incredibly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=prescient&quot;&gt;prescient&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>We're going to open testing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; shortly. At first I only want developers who write great bug reports. My goal is to speed up development and reduce wear and tear on me. Once we're confident it really works as advertised, we'll open up the testing further. There will be a form you can fill out to get in the queue. The choice of the first testers will be highly subjective.</description>

			<description>BTW, start thinking of WordPress as a highly networked, deployed, debugged, widely supported &lt;b&gt;network operating system&lt;/b&gt;. It meets all the criteria. It also has storage. And can publish. And unlike other social web systems, it is textcasting-ready since it comes from the world of blogging where we competed to give writers the features they needed. We can build lots of apps on this foundation.</description>

			<description>There isn’t a single social web network that I like pouring my creativity into. I feel like I’m being used not appreciated. There’s nothing in it for me. I had a similar feeling for Twitter, but they were the only one. Now there are a bunch, and I honestly don't care about any of them, esp now that the election is over. I think this whole idea of feeding the greed of a bunch of tech people is over. If there's a good place to gather, with a small number of people I relate to as people, then I'm up for that, but none of these services meet that need.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT can't remember my coding conventions. It always falls back to using features of JavaScript I told it not to use. I indent my code according to the way it works in an outliner, so I can't use their code without having to manually modify it. I haven't forgotten that I'm the human and it's the computer.

			<title>Are you the nerd of the year??</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you ask for something with Bluesky they tell you about how a user account is like a website, you just have to make it work a certain way, that some devs have mastered, and I guess I could too, but right now all my attention is focused on WordPress and getting it to work well with ActivityPub so my editor can get directly into the Mastodon network and possibly with Threads too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what about Bluesky which is growing like a weed now??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might be easy for the right person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Come up with an interface that makes it so that a WordPress blog is just a user on the Bluesky network.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They have a nice API, I've just spent a year implementing on top of it. I imagine for someone who knows both WordPress and Bluesky this might be a weekend project? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Do it, and blow our minds! There's a lot of content out there in WordPress and a lot of people publish on it.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the best part of it is that it totally drives adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; which is my not so hidden agenda. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And for the people who are starting to think it's only an ActivityPub thing, think again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you do this you might not win the Nobel Peace Prize but you will be Nerd of the Year in my book! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>2024 is different from 2016</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/mobIncited.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It's good to have a record of the things you posted and when you posted it. On August 12 of this year, I tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3kzjvirjq3d2q&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the NYT makes Trump sound like a reasonable candidate that a sane person might vote for, remember this day.&quot; I included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/trumpIncitesMob.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the front page of the NYT on Jan 7, 2021. One in three Trump voters still &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/froomkin/status/1856384929476624841&quot;&gt;watch mainstream news&lt;/a&gt;, which follows the lead of the NYT, and if they had been straight with us, perhaps enough people who like Trump's style would have realized the danger, and voted in a conservative way, ie to conserve the Constitution. Because of how they covered it, we now get to re-run the 2016 experiment all over again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trump-won-what-now-with-heather-cox-richardson/id1583132133?i=1000676185735&quot;&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/a&gt; points out in Jon Stewart's weekly podcast (a must-listen) -- we have more experience too, and perhaps will know better how to deal with Trump and know that &lt;b&gt;his bark is often worse than his bite.&lt;/b&gt; I have to say as the new reality sinks in, I'm not as scared as I was on Election Night last week or even Election Night in 2016. A lot of people will sell out this time who didn't before. But the problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,  and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears. You think inflation was bad? This will be far worse and it's happening now, and nothing we can do at a human scale will make it go away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're dealing with a very unusual drought in the eastern US now. Fires are breaking out where we never used to have them. Yeah this shit is real, and even people who don't believe in science are feeling it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As someone once said, you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/xdc8t4/never_let_a_good_crisis_go_to_waste/&quot;&gt;never waste a good crisis&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of other people feel compelled to move. Unfortunately some are moving to the wrong place, as they always do. Making change isn't easy, but is possible, if you understand how people move. As they try to figure out what the Dem's failed at, that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Skate to where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1bvv11l/i_skate_to_where_the_puck_is_going_to_be_not/&quot;&gt;puck will be&lt;/a&gt;, not where it was, as another famous philosopher once said. And people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors (which I said, sadly, but then put that fact to use to get various standards to fly by without debate). There is a method to human madness, in other words, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

One in three Trump voters still &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/froomkin/status/1856384929476624841&quot;&gt;watch mainstream news&lt;/a&gt;, which follows the lead of the NYT, and if they had been straight with us, perhaps enough people who like Trump's style would have realized the danger, and voted in a conservative way, ie to conserve the Constitution.

A lot of people will sell out this time who didn't before. But the problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,  and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears.

			<description>Update: My guess is that they haven't released enough code to run a Bluesky of your own, because all the answers from people who say they know say the same thing -- &quot;It doesn't work that way.&quot; You &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; write your own, but if we were to do that, why use their one-off API, use a standard instead, and we might have a chance to interop with other systems in a meaningful way. I don't blame them for wanting to cash out, but I do blame them for conning people into believing it's some kind of escape. Until I hear otherwise Bluesky is a dead-end, not worth investing your hope in. If you're migrating from Twitter this is no better. Keep looking. But I promise to let you know if I get any info that changes my opinion, so if I've got it wrong, people from Bluesky, just answer the freaking question in the post at the top of this page. Thanks.</description>

			<title>Democratic mistakes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've actually written a lot, but haven't wanted to publish most of it. So many reasons why the Dems lost. Maybe I should just list them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden shouldn't have run again. There would have been a primary. Given the result of the election this week, we should have found out what support each candidate had with voters. We didn't get to choose the candidate. That said Harris ran a fantastic campaign. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden should not have shut down his campaign website. Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. &lt;b&gt;We were not part of governing&lt;/b&gt;. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama. This is probably the biggest single mistake the Dems keep making.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We needed a prosecutor at the top of Justice. I don't know what Garland actually did, but I'm sure it will all be swept out by whoever is Trump's AG. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Men's votes need to be sought and welcomed, specifically. So much has been done to alienate male voters, which is why so many voted for Trump. We could have had a bunch of them this year, if we had only spoken to them with respect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if we can reboot the Democrats as an opposition party given all these problems. Whatever comes next is going to perform very differently from the party that lost this election. If we try to do it again the same old way, it will fail even worse. I think everyone knows this by now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. &lt;b&gt;We were not part of governing&lt;/b&gt;. Huge mistake.

Rather than doing that, I'll quote the important part. &quot;I don't think it's about economics, I think it's about change happening too fast.

			<description>First thing -- &lt;b&gt;Don't shut down the campaign&lt;/b&gt;. We must keep communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down. Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing. And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero after election, whether we win or lost.</description>

There's no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat for all our problems. It's no accident that the Repubs own the men. We could probably have had ten percent or more of their voters if we stopped doing this. Key point, when you blame a whole gender, you hurt people who have no power to stop it.</description>

			<description>Speaking of Carville, &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/election-day-special-edition-feat-james-carville/id1523896927?i=1000675748922&quot;&gt;yesterday's Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Carville as the only guest was the &lt;b&gt;best podcast&lt;/b&gt; I've ever heard. I recommended it yesterday as inspirational. Now that we know the outcome of the election, it's a marker of where we were before the results were known. A world that no longer exists. But like stories written in 2016, the markers are useful to see where we once were and how we got here, and what we can learn from what happened between. I wish it had turned out the way these two great friends thought it should have. But it didn't. But there was a hint that they knew what wouldn't work this time. No spoilers.</description>

			<description>Ben Thompson wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt; newsletter: &quot;What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective it’s a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!&quot; I wrote in 2017, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;some Repub would buy Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now. When I begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612&quot;&gt;didn't&lt;/a&gt; miss this.</description>

			<description>Also to the Twitter founders, amassing that much power and centralizing it as Twitter did, had a cost that we're paying now. But it's very hard to stop when the juggernaut is rolling. I understand, but in the future we have to think about this more clearly. &lt;b&gt;When a medium becomes too big and centralized, there's trouble ahead&lt;/b&gt;.

			<description>Speaking of Musk, maybe he will temper Trump's desire for retribution. It may be a vain hope, but I'll cling to it anyway. Doing business in a world of retribution might not be too conducive to the creativity needed to run innovative tech businesses. A climate of fear doesn't inspire great software. I know the quality of products Musk makes, I own and love my Tesla Model Y. Best car I've ever owned or driven.</description>

			<description>Final note (I think). The pain you feel at first may abate. It did for me. I had pushed down memories of 2020 and 2021. It was a horror show, and Trump was the main character. So the first thing I had to deal with is that I don't want to remember that. Too painful. But once I realized that's not where we are right now, it's a totally different situation, that's when the creative impulse rose as the pain receded. We have one short term thing to do -- keep the campaign running, and long term we have to recognize division we add, and counteract it. We are the party that welcomes everyone regardless or race, religion, country of origin, age or gender. &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of them. No exceptions. The election result represents big change. And it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;good time&lt;/a&gt; to make more changes.</description>
