			<title>Platform drivers for textcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A feature I've wanted to add to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main&quot;&gt;textcasting server app&lt;/a&gt; is a plug-in architecture so you can add a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md#platform-drivers&quot;&gt;platform driver&lt;/a&gt; without having to reconfigure or even reboot the server. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a new folder at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main/plugins/platforms&quot;&gt;plugins/platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Each subfolder contains a driver for one platform. Initially there are four folder:  bluesky, mastodon, twitter and wordpress. Each driver is a Node module that exports a single function that posts an item to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As an example here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/plugins/platforms/wordpress/code.js&quot;&gt;driver&lt;/a&gt; for WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The drivers are invoked through an HTTP POST call, where the body contains the parameters to the driver. The parameters for each driver are different, because their APIs are different. To add support for a new platform, you just write a new driver. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also have a client app that does linkblogging through this server, that's why my linkblogging these days is so relatively effortless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though the current situation is done without standards, I think not only will that change over time, but this is a good thing. What used to be a corporate silo owned by Twitter, Inc is now a competitive market with lots of players. That's what we wanted back in 2006 when Twitter started, and now we have it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the last step or the first step toward getting them all to coalesce, but it is progress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a developer have a look. And if you're a user, know that we're on the road to make cross-site posting a reality. It works for super-geeks like myself now, but eventually it'll work for poets too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There's also an &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; emanating from my textcasting system, that, in conjunction with the masterful Manton Reece at &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, is how I do my cross-posting to Threads. Eventually I expect there will be a platform driver for Threads too, but for now -- this is how it works. Thanks Manton! It's great to work with you on this stuff. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Feature I really need: A way to search all of my conversations with ChatGPT. It's the one feature I'm most missing, and the most surprising. I'm sure there's a huge amount of utility locked up in that.</description>

Trump was the only comedian on stage at the debates. And his act was fresh. The people who loved him loved that the other people hated him. It really was simple. Like a sports team or a favorite comic. Anyway, the Harris folk are &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; at putdowns and comedy, and the time is right. Trump's act is done, people are tired of the same old bullshit (which is exactly what Kamala said last night in the big interview). That's the cushion they're floating on. If they had called Trump weird in 2016 it wouldn't have worked, and probably not in 2020 for different reasons (he wasn't a joke at that moment, a huge number of Americans were sick and dying, and the economy was in ruin and there was no end in sight, not a good time to be joking around). But now Trump &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a joke. So it feels right. Another perspective you should get is James Carville, who was on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/james-carville-trump-is-in-deep-trouble-and-he-knows-it/id1728152109?i=1000666762884&quot;&gt;Daily Blast podcast&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Real eye-openers re how campaigns really work and why it's working for Team Harris now. And btw, why she's doing great now and not so good in 2019, two things. 1. Obviously she's grown. The last four years she's been VP of the United States. That's got to be some kind of education for someone as brilliant as she is. 2. In 2019 she was on stage with 20 other people, and only got tiny slivers of time. Look at what you find appealing about her now (assuming you do). It's the pauses and looks as much as anything, the facial expression. Anyway, she's really good at what she's doing now, at all levels, and Donald Trump is washed up. That's why it still feels good because of course he still could win.</description>

			<description>I was thinking about Wisconsin news orgs and remembered we called the two Madison papers the Crap Times and the Wisconsin State Urinal. I don't know why that's so funny. Everyone does it. We used to call our own company Living Videosex, and the company that bought us out was Cementech or Sementech. Still makes me laugh. And there are company names that are funny without changing them like Microsoft. Sorry.</description>

			<description>It has come to my attention that &quot;It's even worse than it appears&quot; might not be the right overlay for Kamala Harris, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/08/23/presidentKamala.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; is the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/30/scriptingNewsBanner.png&quot;&gt;banner art&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/30.html&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Of course she's still even better than she appears. I really mean that, and if you read this blog regularly you know. But what would a random person think? Hmm. Maybe that it's strange, this is a picture of the would-be president, and it's a good one. I wonder if there are many levels of irony going on at this moment, the visitor might think. No matter how much I love the Democratic team this year, this is not a campaign site. I don't take ads. This is just a blog. You might have to peer below the surface to figure out what's going on. Even the guy who writes this freaking thing can't see all the angles. For now neither the image or motto are changing. There hasn't always been a motto there you know.</description>

			<title>News on the web still sucks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I can't read most of the stories I want to read. I have the money and am willing to spend it. But there is no system that allows me to pay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand the distribution of video entertainment is somewhat functional, I spend an ungodly amount of mostly wasted money to get access to that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am not cheap. The news system realllly doesn't work. It could be fixed, but for the usual problem -- they would have to work with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think the NYT is a huge success, compare its size to the size of Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon or Apple, all of whom have made great businesses out of distributing other people's products. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/29/marketcaps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Market caps for Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and NYT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were getting somewhere with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/03/132640.html?title=nytAndRss&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, btw -- but the journalism industry lost its minds over Twitter, and let the tech industry own the distribution system, and now it's a total mess, a good time for a re-think, I think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I generated graph in &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/8bbe7d22-89d4-4fc3-b3c3-d56993da3e00&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; by just asking for it.

			<description>An idea for the Harris campaign. Let me buy some &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.kamalaharris.com/&quot;&gt;swag&lt;/a&gt; and have it sent to 10 of my best friends, esp ones who live in swing states. Plus you get the names and contact info for people at least one of your supporters thought would be a potential Harris voter. I'd send something less presumptuous like &lt;i&gt;When We Fight We Win&lt;/i&gt; stickers. Another related idea, let me buy a whole set of promotional materials, kind of like the gift baskets they sell at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zabars.com/zabars-babka-and-rugelach-crate/C110038.html&quot;&gt;Zabar's&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Two take-aways for Democrats. 1. Avoid NPR politics. 2. Appeal to college-educated white men. Most of them vote Republican, but with Walz on the ticket, they have a special ambassador, he represents that straight-talking country folk are part of the Democratic coalition. It's still true that white voters are the majority. Get a small number to vote Democratic could be enough to win the election. It never is about policy. It's about whether you are like them. That's what it means to avoid NPR politics. And btw, imho -- getting the press to like you might not be good. I wonder if the Dems would ever have the courage to sever itself from the journos. Imagine Harris saying &quot;If the press says we're bad you know that means we're good.&quot; She could say that in her big interview. 😀</description>

There's no room for us to love someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or brother. I don't know.

			<title>The status of Twitter's API</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a developer from before. A few bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My linkblog now reliably works on &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.masto.land/@dave&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out it's still there, and there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; that connects to it for Node apps. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It took me a few hours to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543&quot;&gt;support for Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; server app which is how my software connects to all the various services. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally doable. It's already factored that way internally.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should probably write &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md&quot;&gt;some docs&lt;/a&gt; for it too. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api&quot;&gt;deal with Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is that it's free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it enough for a community of users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren't we're going to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

The last time I did any work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx 1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database, verbs, user interface -- for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and now -- a lot of software has been written, and I'm only looking at a fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and Electron. And I have to say I'm totally enjoying reading about what they've done. I'm learning about evolution of technology, a facet of development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed through a tunnel in time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The problem with the state-by-state abortion laws that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/politics/donald-trump-abortion-2024/index.html&quot;&gt;Trump says&lt;/a&gt; he favors: 1. The women in states that ban abortion who will die as a result of the bans, and many more who will be severely injured, and all will have their freedoms severely restricted. 2. He's lying. When Congress passes a national abortion ban he'll sign it and boast about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371&quot;&gt;of course&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

What made me realize it is how natural the idea of &lt;i&gt;President Kamala&lt;/i&gt; feels. Men and women are different, just like blacks and whites are different (it couldn't be otherwise) but we are all Americans, and further, taken together we all &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; America. All of this sprung from that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/video/2012-05-24-how-red-and-blue-states-split-on-green-we-spend-differently.html&quot;&gt;Obama quote&lt;/a&gt; in his 2004 convention speech (which I was lucky to be present for, that was the year they welcomed bloggers). It's the one country that's the Union of all of us and we are United.</description>

			<description>I'm trying to teach ChatGPT how to do sidebar art. So far, it's not a great student. But I have hope. My instructions for the image in the post in the sidebar for the previous post: &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; is the motto of the United States. Out of many one. I would like a simple picture of an eagle with this motto over its head, in the same style it is in on the back of a quarter coin.</description>

			<description>This is how I explained what sidebar art is: There's a certain kind of art I need to create with you. I call it &quot;sidebar art&quot; -- they are images between 75 and 135 pixels wide. The content is on a transparent background. They are designed to fit in the right margin of my blog at scripting.com. Please remember this definition, so you can help me create new sidebar art.</description>

			<title>She is perfect</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;VP Harris gave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbUlKy1D7k&quot;&gt;best speech&lt;/a&gt; I've ever heard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were some great speeches at the DNC. Michelle Obama stood out. Bill Clinton, of course. But it was her show, President Kamala's, and she stole it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She's perfect for our time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A prosecutor running against a convicted felon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A first generation American running against candidate who vilifies immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A woman running against a candidate who tried to enslave women. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A brilliant orator running against an incomprehensible bully.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why wasn't she so impressive when she ran in 2019? Near as I can tell it wasn't the right time or circumstances. She needed the focus to be on her. Whatever it was, she is &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt; for our time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was blown away by AOC's speech on Monday, and thought she's going to be a great president someday. And then on the last day, here's exactly what I was dreaming of. A grown-up version of AOC. Every bit as inspiring, as wonderful, as perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She could be a combination of FDR and Lincoln. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She must be the next president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And she's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/08/19/kamala-harris-berkeley-homes&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; Berkeley! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ignore the NYT, part 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling this thread is going to go a long way, maybe all the way. Maybe the last Ignore the NYT note will be &quot;The NYT has been put out of its misery&quot; in which case &quot;Ignore the NYT&quot; will be what everyone does, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Or maybe the last one will be when the owners of the NYT remember that the function of news is to simply report on what happened, and stop trying to control events. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Anyway -- today's ITNYT story goes like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure Trump has a negative net worth. That's what the trial in NY was about, the one which he was convicted on 34 counts of fraud which included lying to creditors about the value of collateral for loans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump borrows money to pay off creditors he borrowed money from to pay off other creditors. This has been going on for many years. It's probably why he's such close friends with Putin (or wishes he was) because a daddy like Putin can play the role of Trump's actual daddy used to play, ie bailing him out from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump:_The_Art_of_the_Deal&quot;&gt;bullshit deals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a Ponzi type pyramid. He's probably been filing fraudulent statements about the value of various real estate he owns for a lot longer than we know. But he got caught and now hopefully he will go to jail for what he's been doing because it's quite illegal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/20/us/dnc-fact-check/take-it-from-an-actual-billionaire-trump-is-rich-in-only-one-thing-stupidity?smid=url-share&quot;&gt;this fact-check&lt;/a&gt;, relies on Forbes' opinion of Trump's net worth -- which is based on the value of his Truth Social stock (good for them for not falling for the same bullshit the banks did). But that's a pretty weak foundation, too, btw -- given that Trump probably couldn't squeeze a billion dollars out of that stock without crashing the value of the stock, in other words, come on -- that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In any case, there's a good argument to be made that Trump's negative net worth in everything but Truth Social stock on a balance sheet would negate even the full value of his stock. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why I feel bad about Biden</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/22/whyIFeelBadAboutWhatHappenedToPresidentBidenInAPersonalWay.m4a&quot;&gt;17 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: You can skip the first five minutes, it's a long preamble on a different subject. I left it in because it's interesting imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that what happened to Joe Biden in the debate is like something that happened to me almost ten years ago when I was turning 60. I tell the story in this podcast. It's still possible he was the best choice to go against Trump. We'll know soon enough. But there's something to learn here. No one wants their life to be over. No one wants to be thanked. They want you to let them keep going. The thing is that all through life people say you can't do what you then go on to do. It happens over and over. One day, after a life of accomplishment, you realize everyone refers to you in the past tense, but you're still here, you want to keep doing the stuff you do so well. But they won't let you. That's why I feel bad about what happened with President Biden, because I've had the experience myself. Anyway what's done is done, we all have to get behind soon-to-be President Harris. And stand behind her as she is attacked, and they try to get rid of her. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the substance of this podcast, which I recorded yesterday, doesn't start until 5:25. Up until then it's a rambling story about Fox News and how a little truth slipped out when they covered the assassination attempt on Trump a few weeks ago. You can skip over that part if you don't find it interesting, but I hope you do listen to the part when I had an experience that may have been like Biden's at the debate, and how it was probably just a panic attack -- these things happen -- our candidates are people, and they have bodies that do strange things sometimes. No matter what I feel for Biden and that's the story I wanted to tell here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks&quot;&gt;most powerful political statement&lt;/a&gt; I've ever heard. &quot;Who's going to tell Trump the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs.&quot; The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or another, we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; changed. America in 2024 is vastly different from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my feet are planted in, we realize that there isn't a black America and a white America, there's just one America. We finally have come to accept ourselves as we have been all along.</description>

I would love to hook up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/dwPocketcastSubscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; from PocketCasts to dave.podcatch.com, so that I could add to the website from my freaking phone. Make it really easy for me to pitch a great podcast feed to my friends. But I can only export my feeds, I can't create a dynamic link between the two. If I ran a popular podcatch app like Pocketcasts, I would open up my outbound subscription list, and vie to be the default place people come to subscribe to podcasts. If a few of my users were geeks and visionaries, they could start telling other vendors they should hook up to my source lists, so they can use Pocketcasts to subscribe. One place to subscribe is way better than many. If you think things like that can't happen, think again. How did you all come to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for your subscription lists? It's because someone volunteered to go first, and the users of that product demanded that other products support the format. It still amazes me that there's an interchange format there, but we've barely begun to tap into the power there.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT slows down my programming, and that's good</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/21/iProgramMoreSlowlyNowThanksToChatGPT.m4a&quot;&gt;27 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the recording quality, I was in a large space with bad acoustics. I'll try to remember not to do that in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've noticed I spend less time programming, I go more slowly and carefully because now I can know a lot more about each problem I'm solving, and use the packages I build on, jQuery, MySQL, Node, the browser, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, Frontier, to greater advantage. A new kind of programming is possible, and it's better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I go into some detail in this podcast about how the process works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interested in hearing similar stories from other developers using ChatGPT or something like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ignore the NY Times</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in comparison to the &lt;i&gt;president&lt;/i&gt; who was about to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence next to Harris is almost always awkward. He's taller, and moves a lot. I noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I'm not sure that pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a sugar high.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don't pretend they aren't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment speech about them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To the extent we can, it's time to push them aside. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat over and over, &quot;Ignore the NY Times.&quot; I'm going to paste it in 25 times now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.

			<title>The Daily Kitten</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I do a daily episode of the adventures of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wordle+Kitty&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt; as art I do with ChatGPT, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2314356502105075&amp;set=a.113966572144090&amp;notif_id=1724164406352558&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. There often is a NY Times headline in the image, saying something silly like how prisons are dealing with an influx of convicted house pets (like the kitten). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; the NYT is reporting on how the kitten loves lasagna, and of course how cute she is (it's important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful! Keeping me entertained while we try to get through this election. If I'm forced to accept lies from the NYT, without any voice given to opposition, they might as well be lies that entertain me! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kitty in prison, via Facebook.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wonder if the NYT minds that we think of them as no more straight than Fox News. They've fallen really far, and have so far shown they totally don't care if we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
