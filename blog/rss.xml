The code still runs on reasonably current Macs, but not the latest. I really should be working on Linux not Mac. If it weren't for my dependence on Frontier, I would be. I actually think ChatGPT might be a great programming partner for a meaty operating-system-like project like this.</description>

			<description>As I was writing the post about using ChatGPT to port Frontier, which is a C program, runs on Mac and Windows, GPL licensed, to Linux. This took me to an interesting place. Could a bot, having read all the source code of MySQL, for example, then be tasked with writing a non-GPL MySQL workalike that would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be open source? Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Software_using_the_GPL_license&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of popular GPL-licensed software.</description>

As you might expect, the most common answer was the network I was asking on (except Facebook, no one answered there, I guessed that might happen, because Facebook is different from the others). I asked because I'm trying to figure that out for myself, and I'm kind of disappointed that I find myself going to Threads more often. It has the greater &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Sweaty+Palms+Quotient&quot;&gt;Sweaty Palms Quotient&lt;/a&gt;, the feeling I used to have every week in the 80s when MacWeek or PC Week arrived. I always cleared the time to go through each issue carefully to see what my friends and competitors were up to. Then I would talk to my reporter friends, who wanted to know what I thought, or what back-room perspectives I could share with them. This was the time of the telephone, even before everyone had email, in the tech industry, believe it or not. Anyway, this isn't going the way I hoped it would. For me an open network built on the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is what I want to see, what I'm working towards. And seeing products like WordPress and its competitors as full-class members of the social web, because they already do textcasting, now all they need is to be hooked up to a social web that understands that writing isn't just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+grunts+and+snorts&quot;&gt;grunts and snorts&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it'll give you some encouragement that people in the fediverse are most optimistic about their preferred network being the best of the new lot. I still like Bluesky, a lot, because of the intelligence and creativity of the people who use it. And I like the UI, for its simplicity and familiarity, but I'm concerned it'll lose its simplicity when they federate. And don't count Twitter out yet, there's far more happening there than any of the other networks. And a lot of what you read on the other nets  is wishful thinking about the demise of Twitter. Hasn't happened yet, and my guess is it won't. It's really hard to snuff out machines with the kind of momentum Twitter has, even though Musk is doing his best. One more thing to think about, I don't think federation is what we need, I think we need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;. It's a more permissive kind of compatibility, and will happen a lot sooner than federation, which honestly, I don't think ever will happen. With the usual disclaimers, most important that I'm often wrong, and am open to other constructive points of view.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/290&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I'm having trouble running the Node utility &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt; with recent versions of Node. I've read all the threads on this, and it's not clear (to me at least) how to get past this problem. I've resorted to running without Forever on one of my servers, but this is a short-term solution.</description>

Or one article per month? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The current economic proposal is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;News must negotiate with their customers, and stop insisting that cash flow has to work the way they want it to. That isn't working. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Time to start listening to the users. Might also be good for the quality of the news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

By total coincidence we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;, Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of the most tech-literate people you'll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider, Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a lot of lives with his software. And he's still with us, against all odds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just chatted with him last night during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39413785/niners-beat-lions-nfc-championship-game-reach-super-bowl&quot;&gt;Niners game&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Morning ChatGPT Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal dialog for a project I'm working on. I'm combining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo&quot;&gt;Ace editor&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. I've used both components before, but never together. And they're always a bit tricky to get working because I'm impatient and the docs are spread out, and there are different versions. It's all kind of a mess, so you just get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely end up with reusable code. But it's certainly a lot better than starting from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in 2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical scrollbars, and each time we worked &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt; to figure out the problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8&quot;&gt;transcript of the work&lt;/a&gt; I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link to this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up, I'd like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its conventions to mine. In other words, I'd like to return the favor. It's doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I'd like to teach it how to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it can teach human programmers what I've learned about programming in over 50 years of doing this work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;A bit of philosophy. People say these things aren't intelligent, but seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more intelligent in ways than I am, what's the difference between that and actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus on the idea that the person we're conversing with has an inner life that's vastly different from ours and no less complex, and contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but -- &lt;i&gt;now we're living it.&lt;/i&gt; I'm so happy to have made it this far! An amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don't understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so lucky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I'm identified as &quot;anonymous,&quot; but I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8&quot;&gt;Here are its comments&lt;/a&gt;. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can't ask it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn't know about the chat UI? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He said his father would have loved it, and I don't doubt that he would. Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff, wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn from the machines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I bet that would be pretty hard to do. If you add in racists I think you'd be totally out of luck. The people who own the businesses we depend on by and large are pretty awful people. Also I go to NYC even though there are Nazis there (esp Queens and Staten Island). And Twitter has far more users than NYC has citizens. That gives you a sense of how foolish this idea of boycotting Twitter is. And one more thing -- if you're posting about this need to vote with your feet, you should get your ass off Threads because it's really Facebook, and remember you're a very high-minded person, right?</description>

			<description>One of the rules of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is that the writer must be able to edit their posts. An almost universal response is the way Twitter used to explain their not having editable posts -- then people who commented might have said something that seems foolish. I have a couple of rebuttals to that. 1. Then don't comment on what the author said, instead write what you know or believe, so it would make sense even if the author changed their post. This is a good practice anyway, instead of saying people are wrong, just state your belief. It's a lot easier for people to listen to, and by the way the other person might be right. 2. A counter-example -- Facebook. They let authors edit their posts and comments. And somehow it keeps working more or less. Their software does add a note that the text has been edited, and I think they even have a way for you to see the changes, but who bothers. Comments are usually simple &quot;you go girl&quot; or &quot;my brother&quot; or &quot;I'm great!&quot; or &quot;check out my site.&quot;</description>

I was challenged intellectually by my parents from a very young age, asked to think about things that maybe most kids don't get asked about. Somehow my mind was trained to ask questions. What a perfect time it was to be born. Because along come personal computers, where you don't have to use someone else's hardware to explore. And then the web. And now AI. At this point you can't see the horizon, you don't have an idea what the limits are, but you can see some of the paths that lead beyond where you are. It's wonderful to watch people explore this. We can do that because we have the web and personal computers. See how these things build on each other? We were able to do podcasting because we had a way to spread the word through our blogs.

I have no idea if the BDG helped, but it was the only way I felt I could be supportive of the protocol, without saying it was a complete failure. I was unusual in that among the developers of the protocol, I was the only one who didn't work at a big company, so if I wanted to do something badly enough, I could just do it. The basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; was: &quot;If you want to implement SOAP in your app, this is one way to do it.

It's taking about 15 seconds to load. There are a lot of ways we can improve the performance, but are first looking into possible problems in the software.</description>

I felt bad for the Nets. It wasn't that long ago that the Nets were super-irritating because they had been taken over by two reallllly ugly NBA players, Kevin Durant who isn't worthy of NY's basketball fans, what a total piece of shit, but even worse, his best friend Kyrie who is either a complete fucking idiot, or a Jew-hater. Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn't have said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy. But -- not saying the Knicks should have let them win, or that I was even slightly rooting for them. But I was embarrassed that there were far more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don't admit that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.</description>

			<description>I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and that's hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won't have a response to, since you can't control or spin how old you are. We can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening people's minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA.</description>

It was a huge day in my life, and in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I was there that day, along with Kandes Bregman from my startup, Living Videotext. We had a full page ad in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MACWORLD-Macintosh-Magazine-Premier-February/dp/B001OI6YL6&quot;&gt;first issue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/macworld-magazine&quot;&gt;MacWorld&lt;/a&gt;. We were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our &quot;idea processor&quot; ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people at Apple who believed in us, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boich&quot;&gt;Mike Boich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Yocam&quot;&gt;Del Yocam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Campbell_(business_executive)&quot;&gt;Bill Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. I don't know if we would have made it without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn't have to find out. Thank you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software developers.</description>

I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, and this is a pure JL showcase. But the best moment was stolen by Robert DeNiro who is batshit crazy like most of the characters in the movie when he tells his son in two sentences about our purpose on the planet, which of course is to love Jennifer Lawrence. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Why isn't there a karaoke website where I can sing along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dead.net/song/ripple&quot;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt; with the lyrics scrolling by. Could we do it together over the internet? It probably doesn't exist because of Hollywood tightasses. But surely there must be some uncopyrighted music we could try this. Hey I bet it actually exists. Send me a link.</description>

If we all watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy&quot;&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt; and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards&quot;&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt; for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;recent trade&lt;/a&gt; where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career&quot;&gt;Great Hope&lt;/a&gt; of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/&quot;&gt;hotshit kid&lt;/a&gt; with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; was something else. I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel&quot;&gt;Niners and Packers&lt;/a&gt; fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate.</description>
