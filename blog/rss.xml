In the hands of someone who knows how to squeeze money from the US government, as Musk surely does (and Trump had no idea) -- it could be worth many more billions than he paid for Twitter.</description>

			<description>You can live in places where people do awful disgusting things, I know, I've lived in New Orleans, Berkeley and NYC. Twitter is so huge, this idea that it could disband just like that, well it isn't happening. Maybe it's time for us to say clearly what we expect of a social network and try to influence how they run them. We have these great tools for organizing, one of these days we're going to use them for good, in a serious way. And at this point the users have a lot of power relative to what we've had in the past.</description>

			<description>I'm cleaning up some loose-ends in the Scripting News redesign, esp in the phone version. After that, I'm going to start applying the same techniques to FeedLand on phones. Our timelines look fine in that context, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/scriptingMobileScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

We did finally get to the bottom of it and all of a sudden it's working. Except for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I added debugging code, stared at server logs, and scratched my head, until I decided to check if I was subscribed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;freaking feed&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't. Once I fixed that little oversight, it's all &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/itworked.png&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt;, nice and fast.

			<description>If I could devote myself fulltime to AI development, first thing I'd do is teach a bot how to generate CSS with high level commands from me. After 15 years of wrangling CSS, I still create messes that are impossible to unravel, the only way to fix it is to start over, and then that gets out of control, and on and on. It would take some patience to establish some basic design patterns, but once designed I could say things like &quot;a little less margin on top of the tabs&quot; and boom that would happen.</description>

			<description>Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/786af3a9-c35c-499f-8e97-f4b7017415ab&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;? It fell off the air when Twitter blew up their API. I keep wanting it back, because I keep watching shows that should be in its database. I miss it. Then I realized it's not that different from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot;&gt;group of explorers&lt;/a&gt; who are putting their app choices into feeds. The Bingeworthy database is people, shows and ratings. The simplest relational database possible. It would be easy to represent each user as a feed, where each item is a rating. The link for each item would be a pointer to the Metacritic page. And then give each feed a category of &lt;i&gt;bingeworthy. &lt;/i&gt;From there, we explore.  BTW, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/a5b3ac43939954c4af6759a9ce27989f&quot;&gt;SQL code&lt;/a&gt; that creates the BW database.</description>
