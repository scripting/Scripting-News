			<description>I'm doing something new. Trying to initiate topics on the social web. We almost totally respond to external stuff, I wonder how different it would be if we engaged on a more individual level. I've been doing this for a while, but only now am able to explain it.</description>

			<title>I'm from Queens too</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the same part of Queens as Trump, about ten years after he did. His family was in Jamaica, mine in Flushing. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/2931+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/85-15+Wareham+Pl,+Jamaica,+NY+11432/@40.74413,-73.7982607,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2611ad4d2c6a5:0xfe60c1b9262c3e04!2m2!1d-73.7858048!2d40.7170409!3e0?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway&quot;&gt;Utopia Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. A great name for a street, but it's not a parkway and it's nice but definitely not a utopia.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who aren't from huge cities like New York don't know that Trump what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I think that's where 99% of the confusion is. They really don't believe he's so bad. Don't hold that against them, that's nowhere near as bad as knowing what he is and being okay with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don't believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming&quot;&gt;body shaming&lt;/a&gt;, because I care about other people's feelings. If I criticize his appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type who may not be mean bully losers like Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's also a really good comedian if you don't think he wants to have the power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that's the mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole that would have been hard to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt, and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don't like a candidate vote against them don't shoot them. That's American and it's not fascist at all. I don't think they know that he wants to make big changes in how our politics work. People think if he's bad they can just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn't seem to register. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Do Trump supporters understand what they support?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump's followers are deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6 and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They're already doing it via the Supreme Court. It's going to get a lot worse if we go the wrong way. We shouldn't accept that we're horribly divided. The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don't know why and I don't care, I just know they do, based on their actions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I know we're at a high moment, we're excited, and I'm going to enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on &quot;our side&quot; but I hold out hope that being an American still means something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work together. I think that's still our greatest challange and our greatest opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think most of us do no matter who you vote for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Today they ran an op-ed written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin&quot;&gt;Aaron Sorkin&lt;/a&gt; giving advice to Democrats based on his experience writing scripts for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;fictional White House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;television show&lt;/i&gt; in the late 90s and early 00s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yeah the NYT has lost its way. I hope some people down there think they're way out on a limb and it's time to get back to what they do. They are not qualified or entitled to do what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dreaming of the super-Democrat</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some coffee notes for a Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This election is a total mess.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump is extremely beatable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden is extremely beatable too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've all had a chance to live in an America with Trump as president, and Biden. I know which one was better for all of us. (Evidence: our response to Covid, S&amp;P 500 price.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden's health is not good and it of course will get worse in the coming four years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump's health isn't good either and it also will get worse. He doesn't care for himself. He's 77. He's near the end of the decade most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-live-longer-for-men-2223908#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20the%20average,%2D19%20infection%2C%20and%20stroke.&quot;&gt;people die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Dems can run the show without Biden.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Repubs plan to run the show without Trump, he's just a figurehead, I hope you know that. An actor they put on stage to distract you from the nasty shit they are already doing (evidence, the Supreme Court). When he says Project 2025 isn't his, he's telling the truth. He has no idea what's in it and doesn't care. All he wants is to stand up at rallies and vent, and have his own Rick's Cafe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)&quot;&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; and be Rick. It's the quieter, less showy folk that use him that you should be scared of. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even if Biden wanted to step aside, and he clearly doesn't, the mess that would follow can't be unraveled before the election, so if you push Biden out we lose, pretty sure of that. This is why I think Nate Silver lost his way, he's a sports fan, as am I. What's your next move after taking out the pitcher. You better have a good reliever warmed up in the bullpen, right? We don't even have a freaking bullpen Nate (hope he reads this). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But it's fun to dream of the super-Democrat, the candidate who would totally clean Trump's clock, win in a landslide, and when they take office would clear out the junk on the Supreme Court, bring back Roe v Wade, slam the brakes on climate change, and then kick Putin's ass and restore America to greatness for real, and also prepare us to survive the next pandemic. But it's just a dream. It can't happen. Any good candidate will stay out of the mess that will follow a Biden step-aside. No one would want their future tied up in the mess-to-come. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember, your vote is a chess move not a love letter. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/20/rickstanding.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Plot&quot;&gt;Rick Blaine&lt;/a&gt; owns a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The first half is an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries&quot;&gt;Hakeem Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;, you can skip that part, pretty standard stuff. It gets interesting at 17:50 when they take calls from listeners. A lot of different points of view from people of all ages, they're incredibly passionate, well thought-out, coherent. This is way better than the punditry you hear on news. The real crime here is that the insiders of the Democratic Party are taking control, after they were manipulated by the press. A total insider's route-around of the democratic process, it's just as bad imho as what the Repubs are planning around Election Day. The press did the same thing to NY governor Andrew Cuomo, who was elected by the people, and forced out without any legal process, and certainly not a vote. That experience argues in favor of when you're in doubt, do the thing the voters said to do. Anything else is very very questionable. Why are you taking control? Where are you authorized to do that? I think perhaps some of the Dems forget how huge an issue this was in the 2016 process.</description>

			<description>Historically it's unjustifiable. The NYT et al are grievously wrong, and that should be reflected on their op-ed pages. We've been here before, this is as much a hack as Hillary's Emails. Maybe you can't see it now, but win or lose, people are going to look at this period when we all lost our minds.</description>

Something for writers? Perhaps something that moves WordPress into a space adjacent to twitter-like systems? They just added support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; to WordPress, so now you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://jetpack.com/social/&quot;&gt;crosspost&lt;/a&gt; from a blog to a thread. Haven't tried it yet. They also have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/&quot;&gt;identity system&lt;/a&gt; built around Gravatar, announced in early June. It'll be interesting to see what they come out with. I wonder if there is a developer ecosystem building on this, and if they have an evangelism program. I have my own vision of how these things should work.</description>

			<description>The Repubs can win by throwing the election into the House. They can probably get it by the courts in enough places, just a couple of swing states, and they win even if they lose by normal vote-counting methods. The whole bit about Biden's age is meant to distract us from the fact it probably doesn't matter how old the Democratic candidate is.</description>

			<description>Highly recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81614129&quot;&gt;Netflix series&lt;/a&gt; -- esp the last three episodes. I found it enlightening, even though I lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. &quot;The end of history&quot; was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the USA, and the deep and lasting wounds we keep re-opening.</description>

He's as empty as Trump, and much younger, so we can't hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem, because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump's sons probably aren't happy about this. Had he picked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio&quot;&gt;Little Marco&lt;/a&gt;, no one would mistake him as an heir, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum&quot;&gt;Doug Burgum&lt;/a&gt; who is a bit too old to be an heir (same age as I am). We &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have a problem with Biden, he hasn't prepared for this moment. Old or not, they had 3.5 years to get ready, and they didn't. As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest most important thing is that we &lt;b&gt;organize ourselves.&lt;/b&gt; That's the best defense all around. Every attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)&quot;&gt;corral&lt;/a&gt; the insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate. Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he was getting there, but now he's back, and probably a bigger threat than ever. I don't think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need leadership. Not wait to be led. We've waited too long. People who appear ready to step up -- AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn't put Obama on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being nice, unfortunately. We're also not going to prevail by each of us taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;We. Need. To. Organize.&lt;/i&gt; Democrats should roll out new initiatives with the same skill as Apple rolls out new products. Not the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Steve+Jobs%22&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, that's asking too much. But with focus and showmanship, and a livestream, and fanbois and Al Sharpton in place of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;. Focus our attention on each product (ie climate change, social security, Ukraine, etc), so the ideas don't get missed, and we can network in support of the initiative. This is all part of the idea of having a &lt;i&gt;democratic.party&lt;/i&gt; website that we call call home for our political organizing. None of this pissing in the wind we do on twitter-like systems. Form buddy groups of people we organize with, based on locality or common interests. Organize the people as well as the billionaires are organized. This is what political parties should be in 2024 for crying out loud. We're missing the point of the mess in our politics. It's all a mess because it needs to be organized and it's not. Maybe I should take everything else off my blog now so I can use what little attention I have been able to gather here to focus on this idea.</description>

			<title>Stay sane even though the news is trying to make us crazy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should hire an intern at some J-school to keep track of all of my tweets, write them down, then translate each into a rule for what a news organization should do instead of not do. Flip the sense of the rule in other words.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we feed those rules to an AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we flow in the news stories of the day from various sites through the same AI for translation. Yes I know they'd complain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vociferous&quot;&gt;vociferously&lt;/a&gt;, but which ones you use don't matter because the AI algorithm will translate whatever they are to Dave Winer tense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then of course publish them to another site called The News That Helps Us All Stay Sane. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;BTW, I'm intermittently locked out of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; account. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png&quot;&gt;They say&lt;/a&gt; it has to do with automated stuff they don't explain. I don't have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network, it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don't see me over there, this is why.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How I found out about Trump's assassination. By accident, I was watching CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to season 6 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty&quot;&gt;Line of Duty&lt;/a&gt;, which isn't very great. I couldn't focus on the show. I got my iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; hadn't been killed, and somehow I knew that &quot;he&quot; was Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his fist, looking right into the camera. He's 100 percent television actor. Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn't cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed killing him. He's thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies about being a victim, really is a victim, and we'll never hear the end of it. And it didn't take long before a random Republican asshole was saying this was Biden's fault for saying Trump would end democracy, which he has said he will, promised to do, and &lt;i&gt;we saw him try to do it&lt;/i&gt; on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides. It didn't take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate. This was Biden's fault they all agree. Occam's Razor says this is over. We aren't going to vote in November. The deal is done because the journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I've yet to hear another explanation from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph, they'd nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That's how our journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the dictator. This is what it's like after that happened. People inside big companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize. Now their malaise becomes ours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if Biden steps aside don't expect the Repubs won't sue saying it's illegal, so guess what -- not only don't you get Biden, you don't even get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the arguments already written.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An open tweet to Keith Olbermann</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1812139277418971640&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still thinking about your last episode and how you don't know what to tell anyone to do. i think that's great. because no one knows -- in the meantime here are a couple of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;let's organize democratic voters. the better organized we are, the better we can get through the attacks from the nyt, cnn, msnbc, et al that are coming until the election. a web site for circles of friends, a buddy system that gets the word out. can use all social networks, email etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;encourage biden to take off the gloves, even more than he is. he should say the biggest problem is the supreme court. we have to fix it. make this a referendum on roe v wade and all the other stuff that's harder to explain.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ask joe to have fun. he's good when he's saying god love you and shit like that. hand out ice cream when it's hot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;level with people. biden isn't the best speech-maker and 81-year-olds can't run around like they're 50 (he's still figuring that out),  but he's a really good president. think about how it was when trump turned things over. the country was in really bad shape. he totally blew covid. that mattered. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;one more thing -- trump attacked the freaking capitol on his way out. that man has a temper and is a loser. a sore loser &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;biden has friends who help him. make the theme song for the election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C58ttB2-Qg&quot;&gt;help from my friends&lt;/a&gt; by the beatles. put the young stars of the democrats out on the road and sell them as the future that we are working on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;the product isn’t just Biden, it’s a freaking goverment and social security, and owning your own body, freedom of religion, all that good american stuff. It’s the governors of pennsylvania, michigan, arizona, the senators from georgia, it’s the whole freaking thing!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;like it or not the debate &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; start the campaign. Everyone is listening to Joe Jobs now, so say things! Dont waste the attention. Never waste a good crisis someone said.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;have you ever seen a campaign speech with &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/whyVoteForBiden/&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; like a Steve Jobs keynote. Some good ideas there. &quot;One more thing.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;KO -- keep up the good work. and ad lib more. some of your writers are pretty lame. i can tell when you wrote the episode, but i like the ones where you ad lib even more.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>
