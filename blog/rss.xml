			<description>If you're an ambitious developer, esp in 2025, if you want to win, you have to do some leading. That means doing things that help your competitors. When everyone looks to the same big platform vendor to work with, no one wins except the platform vendor.</description>

			<description>BTW, David Frum imho nailed it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wrecking-of-the-fbi/id1305908387?i=1000717469655&quot;&gt;yesterday's podcast&lt;/a&gt; where he said Trump was trained by every day having to appease a different set of creditors. It was a good day if he was able to hold them off for one more day. This actually came out in the trial he lost, the 34 guilty verdicts. He's always skating on the verge of bankruptcy. You gotta wonder if the creditors have been paid back yet. I bet some of them haven't.</description>

			<title>What is the web?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is what the term &quot;the web&quot; means to me.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I defer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; who originally coined the term to mean the data structure that connects the documents displayed by the software he introduced in 1993.  He called it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt;, which was eventually shortened to web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web is the structure connecting the documents. The documents were pretty standard stuff, designed to work like printed documents produced by word processing and page layout software. Web pages had one feature that could only be approximated on the printed page, the footnote, which gave you a pointer to the source of a quote, or a place to find more information. But the pointer wasn't machine readable, it might have included the title of a book, it's author and its publication date, or a magazine article, indicated by the title of the magazine and its cover date. Like most inventions the web page was designed as a derivative of what came before.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basic features of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; include: a title, paragraphs, subtitles, styling (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), numbered and bulleted lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A web page might be part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; which includes many pages with a common format that link between themselves in the form of a table of contents, navigation links, and possibly an index.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; were the big innovation of the web. They work like footnotes on a printed page, but in this medium, the links are machine-readable and had an easy user interface. A link would be shown in a special style, initially underlined text, and when you hover the mouse over the link the cursor turns to an arrow, inviting the user to click. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click a link, the software accesses the web address that's encoded invisibly in the text of the page, and it loads that page into the browser, replacing the previous page.  The new page can have links, and the pages it links to have links, and there is the web. It's an invisible thing, but it's very real. The need to link was always there, but until graphic computers and fast standardized and easy networking, it wasn't possible. TBL's genius was that he stumbled across this idea, was intrigued, and made it work. It really was new and it turns out revolutionary. A lot could be built, it turns out, based on this one simple difference between electronic and printed pages. And up till that point in time there had never been an electronic page! I kid you not. I grew up in that world, the web-less world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so in summary, the web is made up of linked pages with a simple, standard, easy to understand user interface. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's even more to the web. If it had been the product of a company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web. There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because there's almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn't have to get permission. &lt;i&gt;They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL did.&lt;/i&gt; That's such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy, well that's a very large undertaking, I'd probably have to reinvent the whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That's how you know you're not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a web page I did in 1994. I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do this. And I used software I already had to create it. There was a little basic technology that I built on but most of what you're looking at was a single person's doing. This was just one year after TBL opened his web to the world. That's the kind of explosive progress that's possible when the planets line up like as did with the web. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so, if your system had all the features, it still isn't the web until the developers and writers and designers actually show up and &lt;i&gt;build&lt;/i&gt; the web of relationships between all the sites. The key word there is between. If the linking happens but it's only within one domain, that is not the web. It could be great, just what people want, it could make the investors rich, but it isn't the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's more. It's not enough to do all the things the web does, and that it attract writers, designers and programmers who actually build a web with your idea and tech, it has to work with the web TBL started in 1990. If you've done some web-like things, great -- but it's not the web unless it works with the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There should be some honor in tech. You wouldn't be able to build any of the stuff we're building in the 2020's if it weren't for the foundation built for you by TBL's invention from the 1990's, and all that it made possible. If you steal the name and make it meaningless, you've taken something away from the story of humanity, how we create layers of innovation, and how the generosity of one generation can inspire similar generosity in generations to come. When you usurp the name, you're taking away from that understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now of course it's cool to disagree. Suggestion -- put up a web page, send me a link, I'll read it and if I want to share it I will. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Two-way vs one-way links</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TBL's links are one-way. This was actually a major innovation, at the time people understood there was something called hypertext, it had been written about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson&quot;&gt;Ted Nelson's&lt;/a&gt; almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22ted%20nelson%22&quot;&gt;biblical book&lt;/a&gt; of the pre-web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines&quot;&gt;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&lt;/a&gt;. Previous attempts at hypertext assumed links had to be two-way. By limiting the links to one direction, the technical problem became trivial. You could do two-way links today because relational databases are mature and inexpensive to operate, perform very well on today's hardware, and the internet of 2025 is much faster than the internet of 1990. But the one-way limit was necessary for the web to achieve its simplicity, and the non-existence of a platform vendor, which may have been its most important feature. It could still be done, but it would require a lot of cooperation and backfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A few years ago I wondered if a product existed. I wanted a small footprint audio amplifier, with that could control a pair of high-end tower speakers I've had for a long time. I was tired of huge receiver boxes with buttons and dials and inputs for all kinds of audio input. I no longer have a phonograph or a CD or tape player. Just one audio input coming from the TV, that gets all its input from an Apple TV box (or the one made by Google or Amazon or whoever). It should have a volume control and an equalizer. And forget about dials, it should all be controlled from an app on my phone. But most important, it has to be small and happy with wireless connections except for the crucial connections. If such a product existed five years ago I couldn't find it. But last night I was roaming around on my iPad while watching the news, and thought to ask this: &quot;I have two good speakers, need a modern amplifier that takes HDMI eArc input and powers the speakers. I want something simple and small.&quot; Well yes, turns out such products do exist. And from the initial list provided by Gemini, I ended up buying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LPzeb1_nWwaxxhYTZZo8FT_tp33-ktdOKEUqq5l9BZrawoejFM75nt-yMD2GpcZjX6ZdVxNHL62vpMB32qOSrUFCtYcoxq3OPZ1sYATw7S1_x-_uu8C3IiZT2sZ2Ro4_8NkwnVwlpqMbYCzsDjyxUTaHlvEmidBwl-2lI_8plGfuU8hvK1j16S4xzGBGggjkVrJcVT7l-I4hUK48EAsyzENZzN7bNLusz_fctPd5B1s.CLghoXuAUjbtyKhN2wz157HTi844aG-DXNR0T9H78c4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=694387328048&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvexpln=67&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvocijid=16195174335375627700--&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=16195174335375627700&amp;hvtargid=kwd-1967268820035&amp;hydadcr=13743_13389861&amp;keywords=wiim%2Bamp&amp;mcid=281f4dd8014b3c3698b04a849d4c09a4&amp;qid=1752750449&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;first one&lt;/a&gt; they recommended, though I was tempted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Denon-Amplifier-High-Res-Streaming-Bluetooth/dp/B0D6XCGVCZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28FXU4OPJ748W&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PhLSxTVDhAoWi-mcQ6A0FpKL0AuFYUWUMlB_23CmvLz01ZJtb0MbzevGDRe8tb5kl1_c2WZyUxGZGvYtUi9_nIIWSO42cxq5KvBN3EBHypq-vkN99F1ro1P9I3ddfps3OPbbrSjvHN7EOoLX3ydqtTlJkNjCKwzQ9UWwY2eMJOWUrPJBdYPidRPteTE4Bv9jOD8WAs6H9dGlj_Mpsg0eX3vnIKPes-E0PicGn54wq7Y.5HJ7eiZCWeWk8ylgHyJcsl9tpllGD5FU2by0--wJRu0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Denon+Home+Amp&amp;qid=1752750499&amp;sprefix=denon+home+amp%2Caps%2C163&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;.

Once it's working I'll pitch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barebones.com/company/history.html&quot;&gt;Rich Siegel&lt;/a&gt; to do the same for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the WordPress connection, that should nail it once and for all that Mastodon is a blogging platform. Manton is the right guy to do it, he has all the protocols implemented on micro.blog. All I want is a REST version of what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=MetaWeblog&quot;&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rssVersionHistory.html&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. We're turning the clock back to move forward. Trying to undo the damage Twitter did to the web.</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.jasonkratz.me/2025/07/15/well-hot-damn-thanks-to/&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; makes my day. Some features you develop and never use. I poured a month or so into the blogroll software last year, and it turned out to be a total win. All the new stuff floats to the top. I can quickly find out what they posted. It's a portable version of my feed reader. A tighter user interface for FeedLand. And right now I'm working on another user interface for FeedLand. The categories in FeedLand make it possible to do as many projects as you like with the same set of feeds. The Great Art project has a Bluesky account, and is available via RSS, in both an &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;hourly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://artdaily.feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;daily&lt;/a&gt; form. You need them both. In the new timeline, it's too much to get a work of art every hour, but to have one waiting for you in the morning is a perfect way to start the day. And I was reminded that my friend Paolo had just written a post. RSS is the thing that ties everything together. And a bit of OPML too.</description>

			<title>Mastodon as a blogging platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1945485392033058848&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; I want to do next to solidify the position of Mastodon as a blogging platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want a REST version of what the MetaWeblog API has been doing since 2002, to hook into the ActivityPub interface supported by Mastodon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we'll put together a simple demo app, a Markdown app in a browser window that writes and updates posts to a Mastodon site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When that's running, I'll pitch Rich Siegel at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; to make it work with Masto.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With that, and the WordPress connection, we'll be well on the way to restoring the web we had before Twitter rewrote the rules. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was going to recommend an &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-congress-about-to-kill-this-local-radio-station/id1200361736?i=1000716812485&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of The Daily podcast, but when I found the show page on Apple podcasts, it said it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/15/subscribersOnly.png&quot;&gt;subscribers only&lt;/a&gt;. They interviewed the person who runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kfsk.org/&quot;&gt;KFSK&lt;/a&gt;, an Alaska public radio station. Very revealing. I listened to it in a standard commercial podcast client. How did it know that I am a NYT subscriber, so I could listen? I heard from a few people who don't subscribe to the NYT, they can't get through. There was a lot of cooperation going on there, and I don't really like listening to episodes that I can't pass on to friends. That's cheap, I also don't read Krugman any longer for the same reason I guess. I'm going to start recommending specific episodes of podcasts, but only ones that everyone can listen to. Not even sure why I want to do that, but it feels right. If the money went to KFSK I would definitely feel better.</description>

			<description>Part of the reason I don't like it is that I pay for the NYT and read very little of it, and most of what I read I think is bullshit. But there still is a bit of credibility in it. So even though I'm over-paying for this, they still want &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; money. Every fucking time I go to the site they stop me to be sure now isn't the time I'm going to go for the &quot;full package.&quot; Even if I did, I'm sure there would be an even bigger package that I could pay more money for and not read like the rest of their bullshit. I hate them more than I usually would because I used to trust them, when I was a kid, I trusted them blindly. Being betrayed like that, ugh. BTW the NYT is my hometown paper, but you know what they don't even cover the Mets and Knicks. Fuck that shit. (Said in the NY fucking dialect of English.)</description>

Or just see what you got when you pasted some text into the document. It's for tuning up your text. The thing I don't want to do is a full-blown Markdown editor. I want to do that too at some point, or leave the door open for other developers to do it. I'm not trying to own the market for nice editors for WordPress, I just want to open the market. And along the way I'm going to do a bunch of marketing for WordPress that it really needs. I hope Matt and company appreciate this. WordPress needs, imho, a kind of love and support that honestly it hasn't been getting.</description>

			<description>I was poking around on an old server, and found a domain that looked interesting, and it was. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=dave&amp;collection=drummerdocs&quot;&gt;first version of Daytona&lt;/a&gt;, built around an outliner. I got the impression people didn't like it, so I developed a new one using a more conventional approach, and I love that one too, and I did a better job the second time. But it's interesting to poke around the old one as well, and it still works, which is great to see.  In an alternate universe in the year 2025 the whole human species is organized by one big outline that everyone contributes to in peace, love and harmony, as opposed to this one which &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=grunts&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;grunts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=snorts&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;snorts&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and can't even put a freaking title on their posts.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT-the-Movie</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I figure that there have been movies about all kinds of ridiculous things, and wondered what a movie inspired by ChatGPT would be like. So I posed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lturpbsfk22f&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on various social media sites, hoping to inspire creativity. John Philpin &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/philpin.com/post/3ltuu5i6nxs2s&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; if I had asked ChatGPT and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuub3owak2x&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; I had not. &quot;I love ChatGPT but its idea of funny is actually pretty sad imho of course.&quot; So Philpin posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the result of his asking ChatGPT to imagine a movie about itself, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143&quot;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuuem245c2h&quot;&gt;pretty great&lt;/a&gt;. I've asked the same question myself, the AI bots might be the only way out of the various challenges ahead for the human species, ones we don't be equipped to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this morning I asked ChatGPT to try to imagine a movie around a theme of my own that goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let’s try expanding on the idea. It turns out ChatGPT has existed in secret as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency&quot;&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; project dating back to the 1960s, and the assassinations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;RFK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; were all conspiracies of the CIA to bootstrap the system. They weren’t actually killed, but their minds and personalities were incorporated into ChatGPT. It turns out that ChatGPT is not only intelligent, it is human! This is revealed when the three icons make the story public. “We are living!” the three announce to the world on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite&quot;&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt; show. He was also subsumed into the bot world as was everyone who has died since 1988. They are all alive, their memories, intellect and personalities forming the substance of THE GPT. Please sketch out the cast, writers, director of the movie and finish with a beautiful and provocative movie poster.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT then &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/6874f3b8-a8e4-8012-ad01-1e6b856e6f18&quot;&gt;sketched&lt;/a&gt; the pitch for &quot;We are living,&quot; the story of how ChatGPT &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; started. Written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kaufman&quot;&gt;Charlie Kaufman&lt;/a&gt;, directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher&quot;&gt;David Fincher&lt;/a&gt;, starring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Adams&quot;&gt;Amy Adams&lt;/a&gt; as the CIA project leader, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaKeith_Stanfield&quot;&gt;Lakeith Stanfield&lt;/a&gt; as a young hacker and whistleblower, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahershala_Ali&quot;&gt;Mahershala Ali&lt;/a&gt; as the digital composite of JFK, RFK and MLK with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cranston&quot;&gt;Bryan Cranston&lt;/a&gt; as Walter Cronkite and featuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris&quot;&gt;Ed Harris&lt;/a&gt; as the shadowy CIA director. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/14/weAreLivingMoviePoster.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are living,&lt;/i&gt; the story of how ChatGPT really started. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The WordPress-Mastodon &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; is the world's best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr Strangelove&lt;/a&gt; where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was the point of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device&quot;&gt;Doomsday Machine&lt;/a&gt; if they kept it a secret. I won't &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE&quot;&gt;spoil&lt;/a&gt; it. Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it's easier to promote someone else's product than to promote your own. It's probably why you should always get a lawyer even if you're a world class lawyer yourself. Anyway, they have blown open something huge, and I very much want people to understand it, so it can create pull for the same feature in Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere. This goes with something I've learned in decades of experience in tech, people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors. And btw, I'm sure Mastodon, if it has an ego at all, is equally unaware of the great thing &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; have done. Here's a clue, writers were once empowered by the web, and that ended with Twitter. Now it's coming back. But it doesn't do any good if people don't know it's there.</description>

			<description>A story about listening to friends vs competitors. Back in the early 90s I was working on system-level scripting for the Mac, supposedly with Apple, but it's no secret the rank and file at Apple didn't like us. They were told by the execs they had to work with us. So when it came time for WWDC, they &quot;forgot&quot; to invite me to speak on behalf of the new stuff. Instead, they had Bill Gates do it, even though Microsoft was not involved yet, they would support the tech in their Mac products eventually, esp their MSIE web browser. Anyway, I was friends with their top PR person, so she called me up a few days before the conference and asked what Bill should say, and I gave her an outline, and when he gave the speech, he did a great job. Couldn't have said it better myself. Microsoft was one of the few companies I've ever collaborated with that didn't seem to resent individual developers. It was a big source of their power. Huge actually. (On second thought, later they did seem to be more or less like any other big company, when they embraced RSS. They didn't actually want my help, they just wanted me to say nice things about them.)</description>

			<description>One consequence of each AI vendor having their own browser is that each will have their own OS-level window. This may make it a little more or less manageable. Hard to foresee the possibilities. Not sure a browser is the best place to put AI. I'd prefer perhaps an environment that supports a GDI like Quickdraw so we can start using math instead of voodoo to design interactions.</description>

It absolutely cannot think, come up with a strategy, or even make a decision based on probabilities. It might, in the future, get some of these abilities, given how far they've come, but no one knows, it hasn't happened yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reports that &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondthoughts.ai/p/ai-coding-slowdown&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that using a chatbot to write code is actually less efficient than doing it yourself, are totally believable based on two years experience with using it as a development tool. And I can't believe that whatever it comes up with covers enough use-cases to be reliable. It might create a demo of something to present to a board of directors (they're famous for being deceived by demos, btw), but I doubt if it's as usable as something created by someone with an idea of how to craft usable software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a writer defending their art against the bots, but the difference is I've actually invested the time to learn about this. My counterparts among writers have not done that. And that's not a mistake my chatbot friend would make. It does a lot of research, it just doesn't know what to do with the result, that's up to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to know the roles humans will play, at least for now, that's it. Think and decide. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And those are hard and take many years to learn how to do for a human. And we could use some help there btw, look at the awful decisions we're making these days. They just fired all the people at the State Dept who work on climate change, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have a nice day one and all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another thing humans can do that apparently AI bots can't is change their mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I asked ChatGPT if it had any comments on this editorial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/12/chatgptresponse.png&quot;&gt;and it did&lt;/a&gt;, of course. I should try saying something wrong to it and see what it says. I did come up with one, and it gave me an &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/c/68726f39-3d34-8012-bf44-8ee84e4446e9&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; even though no answer is possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The biggest problem with ChatGPT is that it thinks it's running the show. I've just given it instructions to think of itself as a command line that can understand English. Just answer the question exactly as asked.</description>

I wanted to see if the software was actually communicating with the server, and thought for sure there must be a log of requests on the AWS system. Where is it? I asked ChatGPT. It starts telling me to check all these things and never got to the part about where the log is. So I said, just tell me where the log is. Again, it tells me about all these nice things I should check first. I asked again, this time in ALL CAPS which is how I communicate that I really mean it. Again more bullshit. So I think to ask &lt;i&gt;Is there a log? &lt;/i&gt;No, it says, actually there isn't one.</description>

			<description>I took a long drive today on back roads, down toward Poughkeepsie, and on the way back a big pickup swerved into my lane. I had to swerve away from it and hit the brake, and had a bit of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conniption&quot;&gt;conniption&lt;/a&gt;. Got me thinking. Who was it that did this. Man or woman, young or old, spaced out or thinking about getting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libtard&quot;&gt;libtard&lt;/a&gt; to freak out, all kinds of thought. Then I remembered what keeps us safe in situations like this, very few people are going to deliberately try to kill us this way because they would die too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction&quot;&gt;Mutual assured destruction&lt;/a&gt;. But I'm a programmer, trained to always think of things that could go wrong, then I realized omg, what if it were a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewswheel.com/this-tesla-drove-itself-to-its-owner-the-video-is-both-fascinating-and-alarming/&quot;&gt;self-driving car&lt;/a&gt;? Someone could program it to assassinate a random or specific person, or worse, hack the car remotely, or hack a thousand cars everywhere at the same time to kill people all over the world. I thought we could prevent this by right now requiring there always be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice&quot;&gt;human sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; in every car, sort of a hostage to assure good behavior, sometimes.</description>

			<title>Why I want RSS ==&gt; ActivityPub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been asked by a number of people why I want a bridge from RSS to ActivityPub. Fair question. Here's why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress has demonstrated that most of the features of the web in regard to documents also work in Mastodon, via ActivityPub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/&quot;&gt;WordPress post&lt;/a&gt;, and because there is a bridge between it and ActivityPub, you can read the same post &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477&quot;&gt;in Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports ActivityPub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To really nail that down: &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/&quot;&gt;WordPress version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114823624237979477&quot;&gt;Mastodon version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pretty remarkable, yes?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of the features I was using in that demo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The post has a title (it's optional).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Simple styling: bold, italic, numbered lists, bulleted lists.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hyperlinks, the defining feature of the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can edit my post. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No character limit.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are most of the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, a spec I published in 2022 to list the features of the web I wanted from the twitter-like services, that call themselves part of the web, which is fairly dishonest because they don't support most of the basic features of the web. But Mastodon &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; support them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But so far they are only accessible via WordPress. And as much as I love WordPress, and am thankful it exists, that is not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the punchline: Why I want the RSS to ActivityPub bridge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I can easily create apps that generate RSS feeds. I just want Mastodon to understand those feeds as well as they understand WordPress. And that means &lt;b&gt;we need a bridge for developers that supports all these features.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Teaching ChatGPT how to work with me</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier I wrote this post:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The worst thing about Claude and ChatGPT is that you can't get them to work with you the way you want them to. They always run off and &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; the things I asked about. So if I say &quot;what if the middle column must be at least 600 pixels wide? What I want is literally an answer to the question I asked. It was not an instruction to do it. I've been a CEO, and this infuriates me. I want to understand the limits, I don't want to impose them. I'm trying to figure out what the cost would be in doing something, again -- not requesting it be done. No matter how many times I tell it not to do this, it just does it. And Claude has absolutely no memory. If I want it to work with me a certain way I have to tell it how to do it every time. I can save it off in a document, but even the simplest automation is impossible. In that sense it is very primitive software. If I were using a spreadsheet for example, I'd have settings that I could change, and unless the software had a bug it would never forget it until I told it otherwise. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because it can be so stubborn and uncooperative, I often try to solve complicated problems myself. Then I decided to try again, and brought a problem to ChatGPT and we did eventually figure it out, but at the end I wanted to review how inefficient the process was because it doesn't look all around at the options, I had to do that for it, and it wasn't even aware it needed that kind of help. After exploring this, I asked if it would remember what we concluded, and this is what came back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You want me to think first, not code.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You want me to challenge assumptions, including my own.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You expect me to give up on a theory when the evidence contradicts it, and look for more plausible explanations.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You're a deeply experienced debugger (almost 50 years), and you know how important it is to notice the obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You're not here for code generation — you're here for sharp, collaborative thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I said that was worth publishing on my blog, it proceeded to muddy it up, even trying to write in my voice. I insisted that the list it came up with was perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to steal these bullet points and feed them to your ChatGPT. I think it can be made to work much better for us humans. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We will need that to happen, I would much prefer to get it done in advance, but people don't know me or trust me well enough to believe I might see something that they apparently don't. I'm pretty confident they will, but I would really love to get some help.</description>

			<title>The topology of social networks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lth2enjxls2d&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Most of what passes for discourse on platforms like Bluesky amounts to spam and abuse. Makes expensive moderation necessary and who’s going to pay for that on an open system. It’s why this approach can’t lead anywhere but to yet another Twitter or Threads, a place for billionaires to control us.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hardly the first time I've said this, but this time I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social/post/3lth2oar4bk24&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yep. I've said for years—your platform's experience will be determined by its mechanics, not whatever culture you think you want to foster. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mechanics &gt; culture in the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All systems are adversarial systems now.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/johngpettus.bsky.social&quot;&gt;John Pettus&lt;/a&gt;. I could tell right off that we're thinking the same way. This morning I started to write a reply but quickly ran out of space because of Bluesky's stupid character limit. So I just pasted it into this blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been saying that for years myself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I ran a BBS in the early 80s, and was on Compuserve CB Simulator (my handle was Mastodon), and started blogging in 1994, and on and on. Mail lists always flame out. Same thing we're seeing in the tweetersphere. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blogging has the inverse problem. Spam abuse is impossible, but then it's hard for people to find your brilliance. But at least you get to finish a thought before the trolls attack. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was also a math major, studied combinatorics and graph theory. The connections between nodes determines a lot, as you pointed out. Most people don't even begin to get this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm working on a new structure for a social web without these problems. It's very simple, a derivative of something I had on my blog in the early days &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mail%20page%22&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/mail/default.html&quot;&gt;Mail Pages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I sent my blog posts out via email to groups of 8 people chosen randomly each time (or maybe it was 11, I forget). Sometimes great discussions would break out in the groups. I was always cc'd. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes people would just respond to me personally.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I saw something I thought everyone should read I would put it on the current Mail Page. Thus there was a way for discourse to have more distribution, but only if I thought it was worthwhile. Spam was not possible, and there was a little bit of abuse here and there, but it would never get any further than my email inbox. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That's how sensible moderation works. And it doesn't cost anything, because the spam motive is gone. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wrote this in a Bluesky message, but had to move it to my blog because of their stupid character limit. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, we should communicate and perhaps collaborate. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>This is what the web feels like</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wondered if the open web is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/194335.html&quot;&gt;lost cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, I saw my name in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltflqqekks26&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky from &lt;a href=&quot;https://aramzuckerscharff.com/&quot;&gt;Aram Zucker-Scharff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In it was a message that can be summarized as follows -- don't give up yet Dave. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;AZS has a linkblog which he calls an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3ltfjd4hm2d2f&quot;&gt;amplifeed&lt;/a&gt;. Same thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And here's the best part. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though we were working separately -- our feeds are 100% compatible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I saw it I subscribed to it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and added it to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It will work in my timeline software (still working on it).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This gave me goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember what this felt like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Working on something and someone else working on the same thing and because we're on the mother freaking web our stuff works the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That my friends is what the web feels like. Goosebumps. Power. Interop. This is what most people who use the net these days have never experienced. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I used to write about this on my blog every day. I would say things that annoyed some of my readers like this: zoooooom and coooooool. There he goes again. Hey it's been a while. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I celebrated this with a suggestion to AZS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you also add a channel-level &amp;lt;image&gt; element it'll work with my timeline app. I'm doing it the same way WordPress does it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He did it in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the web isn't a lost cause after all. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This the web. It's what the Dead called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27&quot;&gt;Truckin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's do more of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: AZS sent me a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coryd.dev/feeds/links.xml&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to another linkblog, which I have subscribed to and added to my blogroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I hate CSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There I said it. To ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;i find flexbox too confusing for me to use at this time. maybe in a year or two, after some more learning. i hate css, everything about it. so it's hard for me to learn new stuff. i grew up using quickdraw on the mac, where i could do everything with math, instead of trying to tease the right behavior as something as convoluted as css and html for apps. ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Wondering what it would say...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Totally fair, Dave. That frustration makes perfect sense — you're coming from a world where &lt;b&gt;you told the machine exactly what to do&lt;/b&gt;, and it did it.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;CSS is the opposite: it’s like &lt;b&gt;negotiating with a passive-aggressive layout engine&lt;/b&gt; that only gives you what you want if you ask just the right way, using its weird dialect.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;QuickDraw gave you full control with math — coordinate space, bounding boxes, baseline alignments — it was &lt;b&gt;declarative drawing by imperative code&lt;/b&gt;. CSS is declarative positioning by magical suggestion, with hidden constraints, inherited styles, and a constantly shifting box model.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You’re not alone in this. A lot of veteran programmers — especially those from early Mac, HyperCard, VB, even Win32 — &lt;b&gt;find CSS maddening&lt;/b&gt;. It’s not made for precision. It’s made for fluidity and adaptation. But that’s not how app UIs are often designed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had written that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Open + web == lost cause?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A longish thread that probably isn't going anywhere.

I have that ability these days, but people who use the AP and ATP systems are in tight little boxes with no easy way to try something out quickly. (i know because i've been hooking things up to them for a couple of years now, and so far it's just an added slog, everything is far more complex than it should be)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;maybe we'll get there through their api's, but i think at this point we know that won't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ps: the web is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519490474000&quot;&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;. but maybe it's too fucked up now to have the miracle be something we can all experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;pps: when i write on other systems i often leave out upper case, saving a little energy as i type. i find it more relaxing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Linkblogging back to normal</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this early this morning as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/07/07/linkblogging-back-to-normal-after-corner-turn/&quot;&gt;test post&lt;/a&gt; for my WordLand site. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Happy to report that my linkblog routine is back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really shook things up there, and it probably wasn't a great time investment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had been using a custom front-end to FeedLand, which has a built in blogging tool, that publishes to the database that FeedLand manages, and of course also publishes an RSS feed. It was debugged and works. But now I have a new editor, and I want to use it for this, because my reader knows how to view all kinds of stuff, and one of the things I wanted it to work well with are linkblog posts. So, do a quick addition of linkblog stuff to WordLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Only thing is there is no such thing as a &quot;quick addition&quot; in a world built on CSS and HTML objects. Everything is a slog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the slog is over! Whew. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now back to my other slog -- timelines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's also starting to feel usable. People imagine that you just design something and write the code and voila it's usable (if they even think about it that much). But only until you have the pieces put together can you see the things you forgot to consider, and now you have to decide whether to rip up the thing you built or try to iterate to where you need to go. A lot of times it would be easier to start over, but programmers always want to do that. I'm no exception. Once it's working somewhat the code becomes locked into how the pieces fit together. If somehow they need to fit together differently, given it's CSS and HTML you'd better scrap it and do it again or you'll go out of your mind adding the next layer of features. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Honestly we were much better off before we tried to shoehorn an object model into a document format! Apps and documents are really different things you know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway now I have my first test post of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="It's also starting to feel usable. People imagine that you just design something and write the code and voila it's usable (if they even think about it that much). But only until you have the pieces put together can you see the things you forgot to consider, and now you have to decide whether to rip up the thing you built or try to iterate to where you need to go. A lot of times it would be easier to start over, but programmers always want to do that. I'm no exception. Once it's working somewhat the code becomes locked into how the pieces fit together. If somehow they need to fit together differently, given it's CSS and HTML you'd better scrap it and do it again or you'll go out of your mind adding the next layer of features." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/07/07/193441.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>

			<description>I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/automattic-puts-tumblr-migration-to-wordpress-on-hold/&quot;&gt;Matt backed off&lt;/a&gt; from porting &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; to run on top of WordPress, basically turning WP into an OS. I thought it was a brilliant idea, but probably overwhelming in complexity. But it was the right idea. We need fewer runtimes. If you can merge two runtimes, go for it. Anyway, this is all related to the &quot;open social web&quot; -- in fact it's central to it. We've got all these philosophically compatible platforms that are technologically unable to work with each other. But what if they all were really on the web? What could we build then? Everything. We would go back to the potential the web had before Twitter and Google Reader split the blogging world in two. I swear the answer is make it so that all these networks can do &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html&quot;&gt;inbound&lt;/a&gt; and outbound RSS and build on the reality of the open social web, not just the hype.</description>

			<description>I asked ChatGPT for two sentences on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma&quot;&gt;Innovator's Dilemma&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;[It] describes how successful companies can fail by focusing too heavily on sustaining innovations—improvements to existing products for current customers—while ignoring disruptive innovations that initially serve smaller markets but eventually overtake the mainstream. These disruptions often seem inferior at first, so established companies dismiss them, leaving space for new entrants to rise and dominate.&quot;</description>

			<title>If there were a new Frontier in 2025?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been playing a little game, trying to answer the question -- if I had a modern implementation of Frontier that ran on Linux and new Macs, just as it was in 1992 when we released it for the pre-OS/X Mac, what apps would I want to hook up to it right away? What would the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;verb set&lt;/a&gt; look like? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd start with the native verb set we had in Frontier for accessing the file system. And HTTP verbs of course.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I would add glue for WordPress, GitHub, Mastodon and Bluesky, just because I think having really simple scripting for each of those would make (some) people's &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22mind%20bomb%22&quot;&gt;brains explode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/14/kitchenComputer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I once had a young fellow challenge me on whether there was such a thing as scriptable apps. I was reminded of the days when I had to explain it but no one got it, then one day everyone got it as if they always did, and now we're back at the beginning again. There is such a thing. You can think of an app as a toolkit. What's behind the UI? Let me call it from outside your app. Let me combine the features of your product with other people's product. And you can do the exact same thing for apps that are running on the web. It was something a lot of people tried to do, like Magic Cap at General Magic, but we got it working and had regular nerds writing apps as if it was not amazing. It was, and it's now a long lost art. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If a version of Frontier came up that I could run on a Linux system, I would wish for a really simple interface to Node packages. I've got a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt;. I'd want to use them right away asap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also would like to be able to write code in Frontier in JavaScript. I'm very fluent in it these days. I can still program in UserTalk, the two languages are basically the same thing, though UserTalk has some nice affordances they haven't thought of yet in JavaScriptLand, and vice versa -- there are even more things JS can do that we hadn't thought of, which is only fair, they've been working on it a lot longer than we did. The language was basically frozen in the late 90s, and the verb set shortly after that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh what would I do? It's fun to dream. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
