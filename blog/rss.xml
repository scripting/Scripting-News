I thought to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt; John Spurlock pointed me to. But where to start? All the theory upfront, like the spec, I just want something that takes the ID of a post and returns a JavaScript object with a bunch of info like the text, any image enclosed, when it was posted, stuff like that. There really are only 5 or 10 endpoints most apps need. If you're interested in solving this problem for Bluesky, please post a note in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/266&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Reporters say the allegations against Trump are damaging or incredible are yet again selling the same Trump story they’ve been selling since 2016. He’s a full time 24-by-7 criminal. If Trump is doing anything it’s incredibly damningly criminal, and he doesn’t care because he openly says the laws don’t apply to him. The only news here is that someone in government is finally trying to really do something about it, or at least that’s what it kind of looks like. We’ve been here many times only to find out at some point they decide for some reason he’s right and the laws don’t actually apply to him, and so far they haven’t.</description>

			<title>No screeds on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;BTW, I find I don't write screeds on Twitter any longer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I want to piss in the wind I either do it elsewhere or don't do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use Facebook more now, in addition to Bluesky, but I wonder why I use it because it's behind a very high silo-wall. I only realized today if say Substack were doing this, it would so irritate me that I wouldn't use it. I don't know why I give Bluesky a pass on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mainly Masto is interesting again because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=liza+sabater&quot;&gt;Liza Sabeter&lt;/a&gt; aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@blogdiva&quot;&gt;blogdiva&lt;/a&gt; resurfaced, and chose Mastodon to be her stage. She's so smart and irreverent and also incredibly dedicated to her truth. She's enough of a reason for me to check in on Masto. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also write on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; regularly and seem to appreciate it more these days perhaps because it doesn't shut down on me, it seems to care whether I like it or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: That's kind of a joke because I have always written my own blogging software going back to 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Of course I wrote this screed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1684918163018747904&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, proving once again that it's even worse than it appears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: Facebook's folly -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html&quot;&gt;aka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/05/232331.html&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; -- is of no significance whatsoever to me at least. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Bluesky's weird paywall</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm uncomfortable that the stuff I write on Bluesky is not visible without being logged-in to Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Substack were doing this, for example, it would be a reason to not to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure why I let this go for Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho, what I write on the web, by default, should be publicly readable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Corner-turning</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Another corner-turn seems to be working now. I'm sure no one cares about this but me, but this blog is also for me to record big changes in the way I work. So here goes..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/28/marshmallowManFromGhostbusters.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The problem was that over the last four years I've created systems that depend on me sitting at my desk in the mountains, surrounded by nature, a good net connection and lots of disk space. Now I want to be mobile, camp out in various places, and still be able to keep the servers running, update and write new code and docs, and my blog, basically everything I do at my desktop. This has meant going back to Dropbox, but not sacrificing the very nice systems I've built that don't depend on Dropbox, because the Linux version is hard to install, and is unpredictable and flaky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have one server system that runs Dropbox well, so I'm moving all the software I ran locally to push stuff into the cloud onto that server, and instead of saving things to local folders, I save them to Dropbox-hosted folders. The server versions of the software watch the Dropbox folders and move things to where they belong, just as they did on the desktop. Voila, Uncle Davey can move around, and theoretically everything works as it did before. And so far it does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am able to edit all my docs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and my blog, and I'm much happier than I was when I was trying to do all that in web Drummer. E/D is a much better fit for the way I work. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4pN9L2ArGs&quot;&gt;Bookmarks menu in Drummer&lt;/a&gt; was key to making this a (so far) relatively easy transition. But figuring out what to do and doing it took pretty much the whole month of July. Still have a bit more to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I agree with all you said, had discovered it on my own, quickly -- that I could build on Mastodon's docs (and did), but the ActivityPub maze of specs is not an API, and not something a busy developer can approach. It all has to be simplified. We're still far away from the dream.

I think I've worked around it, so it should work everywhere, one hopes.</description>

			<description>As we are fond of saying in show business, this is a test. Had this been an actual emergency, well we would have found some other way of notifying you, because this is hardly the way to tell a fine person such as yourself about an emergency.

Confusing enough that I thought where did I put that tab with the tweet I'm quoting in it. In the meantime, someone ought to grab the trademark MuskCo is abandoning. It's hard to express how valuable it is, the words twitter and tweet are in the everyday language of everyone. It might be the most valuable thing Musk owns. Even the Tesla name is nowhere near as deeply entrenched. I hesitate to say it's a bad decision because I've been proven wrong so many times. But my brain doesn't like what he's done. That one person has so much power over me, I don't like to be reminded of that either.</description>

In hindsight, how foolish was it for Facebook to change its name to Meta. Google is still Google now whatever they changed their name to (yeah I remember, but it takes some effort to pull it up, and as I'm doing it, I'm reminded how much I don't care) Alphabet. These geniuses should study &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)&quot;&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I've spent the last week trying to do my normal development work on a laptop. And at the end of the week, I'm kind of getting the hang of it. The secret is to use Dropbox again, not just to manage servers (as I have been, but am transitioning away from because Dropbox on Linux is unwieldy), but to keep several editing places in sync without too much chance for error. This morning I lost some changes I made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/264&quot;&gt;Sally's Reader&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a really simple app, and not very mission critical, yet, so it was easy to re-do the changes. But that got me thinking about how to get it to work more smoothly and reliably. I've had various systems over the years for this, and it'll be interesting to do it again. Luckily all the saving and opening of projects flows through two scripts, and I wrote them both, and they work very reliably. So I'll add some features, already am doing that. Feels good actually, didn't think it would.</description>

			<description>Journalists are concerned that replacing them with AI writers would make the news less trustworthy.  On the planet I live on, when I read a news story about something I know about it's filled with bullshit and lies, ones that could easily be corrected, but they just copy what they found on Wikipedia. Thus I am pretty sure that stories about stuff I don't know about are filled with similar bullshit. On those same subjects, ChatGPT gets it just as wrong, probably because the bot is relying on the same Wikipedia article that had the original lies in it. If journalism really wants people to have to truth, try giving it to them instead of complaining about how your jobs are in jeopardy.</description>

He says basically everyone should get behind it and stop inventing new formats and protocols for the federated social web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Without any judgment, it seems to me that ActivityPub should have started with RSS 2.0, building whatever new features they needed on top of it. But they didn't. I don't know why. We were going down that path, but then one day I saw that all the people I was collaborating with were meeting with Google and out of that came a completely incompatible protocol, which I believe became ActivityPub. Not sure, because they seemed more interested in reinventing what already worked than trying to build as much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really mean &quot;no judgment&quot; -- because this seems to happen in tech all the time. It's the knee-jerk reaction. People wanting to make a name for themselves, don't have a new idea, so they pretend that what already exists doesn't. Let the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/19.html&quot;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; sort it out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think it's inevitable that there will be more protocols. There already are. So what will be needed is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/142200.html&quot;&gt;analog of the internet&lt;/a&gt;, which bridged the differences between incompatible networks. I think at this point that's the best we can hope for. And in that spirit I offer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; which did that for blogs. Maybe for once we won't have to start over from scratch. I doubt it, but hope is still possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, before you pat me on the head and thank me for &quot;fighting the good fight&quot; (which I hear as &quot;loser&quot;) remember this one motto: You can fake caring but you can't fake showing up. Put some skin in the game. You've been sitting on the sidelines your whole life. If you think we can make the new network useful and fair and learn from our mistakes and experience, get in the middle. There's no point accumulating capital if you never spend it. Now is a good time to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Put some skin in the game. You've been sitting on the sidelines your whole life. If you think we can make the new network useful and fair and learn from our mistakes and experience, get in the middle. There's no point accumulating capital if you never spend it.

These people are beyond stupid. Why don't they take a minute to think about how you develop a new medium. Is it done by adding a few sentences to a spec? I don't think so. You get an idea, in this case it came from Adam Curry (thanks) and start figuring out how it will work. Then you make the software for both publishing and listening, and then publish Grateful Dead music, thinking all the people will now figure it out but they don't. So you try something else and another thing, and you give up for a while. Then you meet an NPR guy and ask him if he wants to try this idea out. For some reason he says yes, when everyone else said no or didn't listen. So you get that going, and it's great and for sure you figure now everyone will get it, but they don't. So a year later in frustration you decide to put out your own show, and do it again and again, and leave the freaking mistakes in, and because of that people get the idea that Hey if that schmuck can do it, I bet I can too, and 20 or 30 people start doing it, and it's fun, and from there, it builds and after four years you have the start of a new medium. And no that idiot journalist did not give this new medium its name. Only a total idiot would think that, which is something I get to say out loud on &lt;i&gt;Journalism is Stupid Day. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Because the value of Bluesky has nothing to do with moderation. You can see how dull and lifeless and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyfication&quot;&gt;disneyfied&lt;/a&gt; a perfectly moderated social network is. Look at that new bullshit thing Facebook just came out with. It's really Instagram, that's how they got all their users so fast by just getting them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/19/jumpThroughHoopDialog.png&quot;&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt; through another hoop. You can stop reporting that it set records. They just came up with a new design and name for Instagram and said it was setting records, knowing that the reporters were bored of hating Zuckerberg, and now were ready to say he's cool again because he is trying to embarrass the &lt;i&gt;Asshole Du Jour&lt;/i&gt; for journalists everywhere, Elon Musk. The thing you should say about Bluesky is that it's freaking nice that these people made a nice UI and backend for the social web and give it away for nothing. Yay Bluesky for believing in all of us. And come on if you think moderation is so great and you think it can be done for free, why don't you volunteer to do it. Yeah I didn't think so.</description>

My desktop monster machine and several smaller machines with huge disks. One system, the one my work is organized around, never moves and the other, 2. a 2015 MacBook running High Sierra, with a 500GB internal drive and a 2TB external, moves with me. By the time this construction project is done, I'll be able to work anywhere, and not have a huge reconciliation job to do when I get home. Or maybe I'll travel with a Mac Mini and a nice big monitor? Or maybe I'll (someday) get everything running on Linux so I don't have to deal with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation&quot;&gt;deprecation&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has inflicted on my ancient lab. So far I am still able to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. If it were to somehow stop running, every year that goes by, it gets less likely that I'd continue. You want to make me happy, port it to Linux and don't break my code.

But this summer. Well the only thing that could be worse imho is if we had this much precipitation in winter. Well, I know that isn't actually true. The heat wave in the west sounds pretty awful.
