			<title>Driving on a mountain road</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/06/03/tinaTheBearNurseFromBojackHorseman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was driving on a mountain road yesterday to pick up a pizza in a nearby town. I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so I drive at the speed limit or a little above. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates, getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road, deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never hit an animal, but I have come close.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to pass on this road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been in the other driver's place when a tourist is driving 30 in a 45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don't freak out. It's perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their horn. I slow down more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking okay they'll pass me now, and I'll get a chance to see who this asshole is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we come to the next stop sign, it's the end of the road and you can go left or right. I'm going right, they're going left, and the road is wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last kind of person I would expect to make such a scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I don't speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn't in any kind of a hurry. It's not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when I slow down and add a few car lengths between us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these stories. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've tried to get people who make podcast clients to listen. Yes I am a user, but I also designed the technology, and did the first implementations, so I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; what's possible.</description>

I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to &quot;just happen&quot; organically.</description>

It's about service, the connection between the staff and the people who come to eat, and the medium is the food. It's the same idea. There's so much cynicism around tech, and I hate that.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;The RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; is doing a lot of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links from the RSS feed show up on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;give&lt;/a&gt; it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; of the linkblogging feed, and then click on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png&quot;&gt;Add Threads&lt;/a&gt; -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;Feeds page&lt;/a&gt; is where you set it up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I used to think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html&quot;&gt;Twitter as a coral reef&lt;/a&gt;, but its role as a world wide notification system is fading, and we haven't replaced it with anything. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 when the utility of Twitter was just becoming apparent.</description>

			<description>I was recruited to speak at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti&quot;&gt;Ria Novosti&lt;/a&gt; conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn't, seemed like a fair deal. Something about it didn't smell right though, so I stayed home.</description>

For me, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for ActivityPub but that's more complicated than it may seem. As often is the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I think it's better if we, as users, remain diversified.</description>

			<description>If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had, where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for retaining practices that work. It's a shame to work something out, come up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again 23 months later when you encounter the same problem.</description>

			<title>Ignore polls</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want a better idea of how it's going, look at where the ad dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And make sure all your friends know that you're voting and who you're voting for. I think that makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm voting straight Democratic party line.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Could we agree that ChatGPT can ingest everything that's in Wikipedia? I particularly want the images. I'd like to ask for a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry&quot;&gt;Chuck Berry&lt;/a&gt;, and get something nice and be able to put him in a scene with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wordle+kitty%22&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt;. That seems pretty harmless. And the news industry could hardly object, they didn't invent Chuck Berry, or own the copyright of the picture of him in Wikipedia.</description>

			<description>I'm searching for some common ground between the twitter-like systems, a basis for interop, a common API even. We had that for the blogging layer of this onion, something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;.  All the popular blogging software supported it. And that meant you could write once and publish to many places. And you could write the script that did that in an afternoon or two. We started out with simple systems and the best of intentions. There's no technical barrier. And we could do it in a few weeks at most if there was a will to do it</description>

			<description>BTW the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaWeblog&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for the MetaWeblog positions it as a replacement for the Blogger API, but it's an extension of it. You could use MetaWeblog to publish to Blogger sites, but it also supported features that Blogger didn't have, that were in our blogging software, Manila.</description>

So you can be pretty sure the killing won't stop there at least until after our election. One way to be sure the killing continues is to elect Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's wonderful that we're laughing at Trump now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a joke to think that after all he took us through, there are 47% of the people in the country who want more of that! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OMG we must be crazy.

			<description>I keep seeing mention of &quot;Podcast 2.0&quot; in various places. That is unusually greedy, even for the tech industry. What next? Deprecating the way podcasting has worked for the last 20 years? How do we know the people doing this aren't shilling for Spotify, Google or Amazon? Please don't mess with something that works as well as podcasting. You want to do something better, great -- make your own name and get people to respect it. Stealing respect from podcasting tells me you have no honor or self-respect, and it should say the same to everyone else. Something else that tells you it's bad, they never bothered to send me an email. Welcome to the tech industry.</description>

			<description>Just watched a Harris rally in Charlotte NC. She's using what Trump said in the debate in her new campaign speech. Brilliant. Getting him on the record in that context is a gift. 60 million viewers. Up till then he only took interviews where he could bully his way past the interviewer.</description>

			<description>And btw I also am wasting my ideas too, one in a hundred has any influence, and even then it's minscule, the ideas drift away unimplemented or unused. I keep writing, hoping I see a way to get into the global conversation, again. I remember what it's like. But I'm not done. We still have a big problem to solve in our political and communication system. Online software is where it's at.</description>

			<title>Dropbox almost reinvented the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/113125134990424609&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; to Miguel de Icaza, a longtime developer friend, how Dropbox was within inches of making the web a million times more useful, ten years ago, and then backed away from it. I don't think I've ever told the story here on my blog, so here goes. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Dropbox had a developer program, you could write an app, and register it with them, and then the user could run your app from a website, and log on to Dropbox in the app, and they would have access to files in a directory in the user's Dropbox hierarchy in the app, as if it were accessing it from the local file system, which in a way they were.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made an &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; for that system, and loved it -- it was great, I didn't have to get into the business of reselling storage, or user identity. And for the users, it &quot;just worked&quot; as they say, because they were already using Dropbox, and now it could be used for something completely new and incredibly useful, and it didn't require huge venture capital to get it going, so it would enable very small niche products to find a market. It was brilliant and visionary, and I was very open about my feelings on my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also had a Public Folder, where any user files could be accessed over the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were within an inch of the perfect system. The problem was my app couldn't access user files in any other directory. So it didn't allow for specialization in products, every editor had to do everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had an option where you could give an app access to &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; but that was ridiculous, I couldn't recommend users do that. Users store all kinds of private data on Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/fargo/dropbox.html&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; for the product and how it connects to Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They lost interest in this, btw -- and when they broke the API, I took that opportunity to shut down the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish they had gone in that direction, or someone would go in that direction. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wouldn't have traded places with Harris for anything in the world, she did fantastic. The pressure on her was enormous. I don't think Trump said one thing that was true. And Harris made the point that the division is coming from that guy over there, and if we don't want it all we have to do is turn the freaking page. For once the power is with the people. The Repubs in the Senate wouldn't vote to convict, the Supreme Court just gave him immunity, but the American people, in a few weeks, can tell them all to fuck off.</description>

			<title>A slip of the tongue?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It would have been cool if Harris had said &quot;He's going to have you for dinner&quot; instead of &quot;He's going to eat you for lunch,&quot; which is what she said Putin would do to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Makes you wonder if that was a slip of the tongue or if it was a little Easter Egg she dropped for our later amusement. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It takes a lot of impressions to get people to believe she can be president. If she wants to win, she has to do a lot of interviews and rallies and say quotable things, and be tweeting all the time, not just in the campaign snark accounts (which are great) but also seriously in her own name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People aren't going to care about the policies though they will say that's what they want more of. What they want to feel is that she is present. Biden was invisible that's why they didn't like or trust him, even though he is a good president. Trump is very present, and they like that, trust that, but most of them also know he's a creep. She just has to keep beating the drum. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the secret is to keep beating the drum, constantly, after she wins. Don't disappear like Obama did. She must not only be president of the United States, but she has to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentKamala.html&quot;&gt;president of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; too (and by Twitter I mean all the twitter-like systems). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So don't expect undecided voters to all convert to Harris in one event. But they will if she stays in the news, even dominates the news (please) and help them see Trump as a thing of the past. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the way to win, and to win in governing too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Podcast: Twitter President Kamala</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Harris must become president of Twitter before becoming president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After the debate, Harris should be interviewed anywhere they'll have her. Go ahead and be overexposed. Answer every question with one of your major positioning statements. Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts, whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being heard &lt;i&gt;all the time&lt;/i&gt; was his biggest sin. Harris should get accustomed to being accessible when she's in office. Keep the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/&quot;&gt;kamalahq&lt;/a&gt; snark channel going. This will have been Trump's contribution to American politics, no fear of being heard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS&quot;&gt;BRIC&lt;/a&gt; countries == Brazil, Russia, India and China.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's population is 215 million, US is 333 million, so Brazil is 64% of US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we win the Twitter presidency we will have Jumped the Trump. ðŸ˜‡&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentHarris.m4a&quot;&gt;12 minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the value in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to a reunion at Berkman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html&quot;&gt;after 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn't do it every year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;But I have a feeling there's a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I was writing for Wired). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;started blogging&lt;/a&gt; and believe me the icons of the Valley for the most part &lt;i&gt;did not like it.&lt;/i&gt; They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases. But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be buried, and I wrote about it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Woz&lt;/a&gt; liked it. I was popular at the parties, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen&quot;&gt;Heidi Roizen&lt;/a&gt; once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement (the one where Steve came back). There weren't many people there, maybe 20 or 25. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121&quot;&gt;upcoming book&lt;/a&gt; that I'm like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig&quot;&gt;Zelig&lt;/a&gt; of tech. This is what he meant, imho. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from tomorrow. You won't hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably won't hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special in mind myself. Hopefully it'll come together in the next month, or sooner. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to 1994, by looking to the future. You won't need an invite, btw. It'll open to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Peering in the social web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A very practical issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k&quot;&gt;BlueSky&lt;/a&gt; has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I cross-post to, namely:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads: 500&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS: no specific limit&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;WordPress: no specific limit&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BlueSky: 300&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This will be a problem when we eventually get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering&quot;&gt;peering&lt;/a&gt; working cross-network among twitter-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to start, although I don't think ultimately there should be any specific limits. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send messages across these boundaries, but wouldn't handle the engagement features, likes, replies, forwarding. It's what many people are starting to do now, by hand. There's no way to put it off, imho -- the Bluesky limit is already hard to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
