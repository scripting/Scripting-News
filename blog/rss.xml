			<description>I'm rebuilding my nightly email-sending code from the bottom up. Something I never properly understood is that most mail clients don't include your CSS files, so people were seeing the writing and images with no style. What an embarassment. As often is the case in 2025, I have ChatGPT to guide me through getting this right. The secret is inline styles. And there's no simple way to do the conversion, except element by element. Seems like an OS could do this for us somewhere along the line. Now I have to think about how to test it without trying to just switch it over, trying to avoid breaking everyone at once. But the nightly email might start looking a lot better for some real soon, and for others, only slight almost no noticeable differences.</description>

			<description>We should demand that the new owner of Chrome must respect the open web as something it does not have the power to change.

			<title>ChatGPT can level the playing field</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a company that I have an account with because they're the only ones who provide the service I need, so I have to stay with them. They have made my telephone unusable, they call me all the time from varying phone numbers, wanting me to do things, or with a &quot;courtesy reminder&quot; that I could spend more money with them. My number is a cell phone btw. On my user profile on their site, I unchecked &lt;i&gt;phone&lt;/i&gt; as a way for them to contact me, only leaving email checked. They appear to be ignoring this. My question is this -- how do I get their attention and get them to stop calling me. The constant interruptions are interfering with my life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was a ChatGPT prompt. It gave me lots of options, but two were outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, they knew their privacy account, and a form on their website for reporting privacy violations. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They suggested I use commands in my cell phone to block unknown numbers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hadn't thought of doing this until today. Usually the big companies have all the power. They can force you to call them back and wait on hold and then it's not clear they'll even understand or respect the request. ChatGPT also suggested the FTC (heh I doubt if it can do much with Trump as president) or the state Attorney General (we still have a government in NY). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So think about it next time you have trouble with a megamonolithic company that's bullying you. We may have a tool at our disposal that levels the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My programmer friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning from Oaxaca in Mexico. We are here with my sad and depressed programmer friend, back from his European tour of glee club train compartments, receptions and cheese races with Europeans named Gouda, happy and carefree while my programmer friend, pictured here, thinks about returning to the good old United Snakes of Americans. As he sits on the beach, admiring the sunrise over the Pacific Ocean, he considers taking a job at a local Burger King. He enjoys their hamburgers even if he is not enjoying life at the moment. His eyes are tearing up as he remembers the tragedy that befell him and others in the Great Gouda Race of Luxembourg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/23/myProgrammerFriend.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;On the beach, dreaming of hamburgers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The runner of life and freedom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Start with the dark imagery of the Ridley Scott commercial for Apple in 1984. A woman athlete is running toward a screen carrying a big hammer, getting ready to hurl it at a huge screen with Big Brother's head, lecturing a huge hall filled with lifeless people listening. He has dead eyes. The runner represents life and freedom.  The overall image is dreary and lifeless but she is a bright light of hope for the future. Inspire me with this image. I want to be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/23/wouldntItBeNice.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;He has dead eyes.

			<description>If you're a young person contemplating a career in tech, great! It's fun, and you can help people doing this. But please don't listen to the VCs and entrepreneurs who say it's all about changing the world. Instead think of it this way -- you're going to create tools for people who may change the world, in collaboration with lots of other people. No one person is that smart and experienced that they know what's best for the world. The stories you heard about great inventors probably aren't true. And the ones who actually changed the world, may not have changed it for the better. Look at what happened with Twitter as a cautionary tale. Imho it would have been better if the founders had made less money, and opened the door for lots of competition right from the start. That's the philosophy of the web. Instead they captured the web, amputated all its good features, and locked it in the trunk and then cut off its air supply. That was inevitable given the path they went down. Yes they changed the world, and in turn are creating a lot of misery. You don't want to do that, brilliant young tech person, right? Let's make the world better, one little evolutionary step at a time. More about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/21/141055.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<source:outline text="If you're a young person contemplating a career in tech, great! It's fun, and you can help people doing this. But please don't listen to the VCs and entrepreneurs who say it's all about changing the world. Instead think of it this way -- you're going to create tools for people who may change the world, in collaboration with lots of other people. No one person is that smart and experienced that they know what's best for the world. The stories you heard about great inventors probably aren't true. And the ones who actually changed the world, may not have changed it for the better. Look at what happened with Twitter as a cautionary tale. Imho it would have been better if the founders had made less money, and opened the door for lots of competition right from the start. That's the philosophy of the web. Instead they captured the web, amputated all its good features, and locked it in the trunk and then cut off its air supply. That was inevitable given the path they went down. Yes they changed the world, and in turn are creating a lot of misery. You don't want to do that, brilliant young tech person, right? Let's make the world better, one little evolutionary step at a time. More about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/21/141055.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;." created="Tue, 22 Apr 2025 12:13:17 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/22.html#a121317"/>

			<title>Don't try to change the world</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley encourages entrepreneurs to think in terms of changing the world. I was one of them when I arrived there in 1979 at the age of 24, with world-changing software ready to go (or so I thought). A few years later, I shipped a way of writing that was only possible on a computer, and in a small way I suppose it did change the world. I kept innovating, but over time I came to realize that one person trying to change the world is usually futile, but what's even worse, you might actually manage to change the world, and that's going to be a disaster for you and the world. As Elon Musk is doing right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk is the perfect cautionary tale for &quot;be careful of what you wish for.&quot; No one person should change the world. We are a creation of evolution, and we also are creators of evolution, but evolution is the result of lots of infinitesmal events, not some great god-like creation that young people tend to dream of. That's what he's doing wrong, trying to force his vision on all of the rest of us. We'd be crazy to wish for what he wants, and we're not that crazy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty good idea of what he wants because like him, I think in terms of what you can do with networks of computers and people. And I understand their weakness, and also believe in the good intentions of 99.99% of the people, so even though our networks are not perfectly secure somehow we seem to get by. But Musk has gotten inside, and is doing what he wants, and the rest of us don't get a say, and he's of the 0.01% you absolutely &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to have the keys to the treasury or nukes of the United States in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of wise people over a few hundred years set up a system where we all get a say, and it's gotten us by pretty well. When one person takes control, that's disaster, because no one, not even Musk, is an immortal god. He's got huge blind spots. If you try to rewrite every bit of code too fast you end up with a broken system. He'll leave and we'll have to deal with what remains. And hopefully after we get over that, we'll figure out how to not let a future Musk get in there again. And that's going to involve a fair amount of pain for the billionaires. If you all want to start helping to solve the problem, now would be a good time to get involved, Mr and Ms Billionaire. Thanks for listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/09/03/201849.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a141000&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; -- there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clip.cafe/sleeper-1973/what-happened-everybody/&quot;&gt;great joke&lt;/a&gt; in the Woody Allen movie Sleeper. It was about Albert Shanker playing the role of Elon Musk, who wasn't born when the movie came out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But it was an O'Reilly exec, Dale Dougherty, who drove it. I suppose perhaps Tim was saying, effectively, that Dougherty never told him what he was doing. But the information of his involvement was available publicly. At the time, we had the web (obviously) and good search engines. And O'Reilly Associates was a journalistic organization -- he could have asked someone to research it for him. Also the tech guy who ran the project was an O'Reilly employee. Maybe Tim didn't know. But he sure took it out on me personally. A lot of doors were closed to me because of this clash. But I don't apologize for anything I said. It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a company thing. If Tim wasn't aware of what his #2 guy was doing, sorry that's not on me. But everyone involved knew it was O'Reilly doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- if ChatGPT had existed at the time, he could have asked for an impartial opinion. I'm going to try it now. Here's the prompt I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In 1999 or 2000 (not sure of the exact date) there was a fork of RSS, turning it into a dialect of RDF, a format that was being promoted by the W3C. They called it RSS 1.0. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It never really took hold, never became widely used, because the earlier version of RSS, v0.91 was being adopted at a very high rate because it was being supported by all the blogging platforms of the day, and by major publishers, including Salon, Red Herring, Motley Fool and Wired. Later the NY Times would support RSS 2.0, which was an evolution of RSS 0.91, and then the entire news industry followed their lead, and RSS quickly became the most popular way to read news on the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the question. Was O'Reilly Associates involved in the RSS 1.0 fork? Tim O'Reilly, at the time, said it wasn't involved. But Dale Dougherty, the #2 exec at O'Reilly lead the effort, and the technical lead was an O'Reilly employee. Would it be fair to say that ORA was involved. Would the fork have happened without their involvement? Try to be as impartial as you can.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have asked ChatGPT to give me a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/680644ab-ee60-8012-b3b5-77ddc2300958&quot;&gt;shareable version&lt;/a&gt; of its answer -- but I find that often people say they can't read it. But you have the prompt so you can ask ChatGPT or any other AI app, for it's (hopefully) impartial response. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: I fed the same prompt into &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/share/e347df31-c906-4db1-bb16-909f9e15541f&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/bae87a853d69&quot;&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Another view of me via ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who look down their noses at ChatGPT and its cousins tend to say it's not art. Hardly the most interesting thing, but as I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/28/124753.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;, art lives mostly in the mind of the viewer, it's the effect it has on the viewer -- that imho is the art. BTW I can tell when people have actually used the product, and most of the critics haven't. Sorry but until you use it you won't know how obvious that is to someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been interested in using ChatGPT to mash images together. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/20/200843.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I asked for a rendering of my headshot through a self-portrait of my niece. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)&quot;&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; with music but with images. I say here's a photo of me, and here's a drawing someone else did. Can you render the image of me in that style? As I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/20/200843.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; with my niece's portrait of herself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've also been doing stories that started with an image of Mark Zuckerberg, calling him &quot;my programmer friend&quot; and taking him through all kinds of adventures, none of which could shake his depression. It was like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordle%20kitty&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt; from last year, only these only went out via Facebook. I wish I had them in an easily shareable format, but next time I may start a group for them, or something else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a cartoon of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth&quot;&gt;Pete Hegseth&lt;/a&gt;, the US Secretary of Defense drawn by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deadder.net/home&quot;&gt;Michael de Adder&lt;/a&gt;. I thought wow that's different. I wonder what ChatGPT would do if I asked it to render my headshot in the style of that drawing? While it was doing the work, I tried to imagine what it would do with it! Would I be wearing a military uniform? Would I salute the viewer? Would it change my expression?

				<source:outline text="People who look down their noses at ChatGPT and its cousins tend to say it's not art. Hardly the most interesting thing, but as I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/28/124753.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;, art lives mostly in the mind of the viewer, it's the effect it has on the viewer -- that imho is the art. BTW I can tell when people have actually used the product, and most of the critics haven't. Sorry but until you use it you won't know how obvious that is to someone who does." created="Mon, 21 Apr 2025 12:01:45 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/21/121202.html#a120145"/>
				<source:outline text="Lately I've been interested in using ChatGPT to mash images together. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/20/200843.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I asked for a rendering of my headshot through a self-portrait of my niece. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)&quot;&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; with music but with images. I say here's a photo of me, and here's a drawing someone else did. Can you render the image of me in that style?

It was like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordle%20kitty&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt; from last year, only these only went out via Facebook.

I thought wow that's different. I wonder what ChatGPT would do if I asked it to render my headshot in the style of that drawing?

It was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://respond.census.gov/acs&quot;&gt;.gov address&lt;/a&gt;, and looked like a government form. The initial questions were standard census questions, then they started getting into personal things that I didn't like answering. Then they &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/19/censusFormPage.png&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; if I was born in the US. That's a really shitty question &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-trump-6f0cb929c4604ec1d9bf9fea99765b61&quot;&gt; to ask now&lt;/a&gt;. I was glad to see that I could just click Next without answering any question, and they got worse, more invasive, esp considering who the president is, and who he brought with him, so I just closed the page and wrote this post. I would, if I had it to do over again, not answered any of their questions, or maybe stopped at the standard Census questions from years past.</description>

			<description>One reason I want to bring blogging and social media together is so I don't have to think about where I will post stuff. This is really important. I want my blog to be a complete record of everything I write publicly. The way our online writing world has been siloized, basically no one has that. We're going to try to fix that, and not with just my software, but by setting some new standards for interop, extensions to RSS, so that there's no exclusivity to making software for writers or publishers. That's what I mean when I say something is &quot;on the web.&quot; If your system is not 100% replaceable, today, they you are not on the web and should not claim it. If you're thinking about freedom, btw -- this should be part of your big picture. So many smart people don't want to know how our networks work, and that makes you a victim. And it's not that hard to understand, no matter what people have led you to believe.</description>

			<description>I keep coming back to this -- ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and isn't that what we want? To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.</description>

			<description>Everyone has to communicate in plain language, directly to the people. The courts, universities, every institution that the president is defaming. Go direct, go around the media. Start communicating in the language we communicate in these days. Use the tools. The campaign never stops. Then we'll know what we have to do to protect the rule of law. And the Dems are starting to do that, some of them, thankfully. Best example so far -- AOC and Bernie. Elizabeth Warren. Chris Murphy, Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen. And lately some Repubs too. It's the same old thing the web does -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/13/165056.html&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Twitter was a fine start, in 2006, but today it’s clear a lot of its rules and limits were mistakes. 19 years later it’s ridiculous that Bluesky and Mastodon repeat those mistakes. I love the term he uses, the &quot;shape&quot; of Twitter. Each decision we make in developing our means of discourse &lt;i&gt;shapes&lt;/i&gt; the discourse. And with the character limit and the inability to edit, and the incentives are all wrong (I can tap into your follower flow without your permision just by posting a reply) it makes almost all twitter-like discourse spam or abusive. I'm planning a different structure for discourse in the world shaped by WordLand. A reply will only be visible to the person who you're replying to. If &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; want others to see it, they can make it public. It's their choice. So you probably should be respectful if you're looking for a flow boost. You can turn off all discourse if you want, giving the ability to finish a thought. We've learned so much about this in the 19 years since Twitter started. It's time to break out of the limits. BTW, that's what my &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; doc was all about.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/26/154836.html&quot;&gt;Join a Parade Today&lt;/a&gt;. When people talk about What You Can Do on podcasts or on TV, they say lame things that don't work that well. One thing for sure is that when Bernie and Alexandria do a rally in your area, you can go and enjoy the energy. This is a good thing because it gives the TV cameras something to focus on. But here's what I think the best thing to do is. Don't start something, join something. Because two is way more powerful than one, and three is way more powerful than two. When people work together on something good, more people doing it is usually even better.</description>

			<description>Looking for help from people who know how to create WordPress themes. The goal is to create a default theme that works well for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;-authored sites. It was suggested I try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/retrospect?tab_filter=blog&quot;&gt;Retrospect theme&lt;/a&gt;, and it does &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/15/siteshot.png&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; quite nice when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/54#issuecomment-2807218882&quot;&gt;switched over&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/04/15/this-is-not-the-america-we-grew-up-in/&quot;&gt;daveverse site&lt;/a&gt; to use it.

			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/114335522071398061&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: ChatGPT is to Google what Google was to library card catalogs. The great thing about Google when it was first out was that unlike previous search products, they searched everything, including our blogs, and that opened up knowledge to us that had been previously, for all of our history as a species, not accessible. And LLMs are similarly revolutionary. I'm doing much better, deeper work, with great results for my users, than I could have accomplished with the network defined by Google.</description>

			<title>What is Inbound RSS?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a complex piece here earlier, but it's much simpler than it made it sound, so I decided to start again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as outbound. Same feed, different contexts. Like trains going in and out of a station. Inbound and outbound. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But some software views RSS in both directions. The best example is Twitter and its successors such as Mastodon, Threads and Bluesky. These products are for both for reading and writing. It makes sense to have outbound feeds, like a blogging tool, and it makes just as much sense as a consumer of feeds, like a feed reader, so we can easily publish stuff from other environments and people can subscribe to them exactly as if they used their editor to write it. No reason anyone needs to know. &lt;i&gt;This is absolutely the simplest and most web-like way to do federation. &lt;/i&gt;And you don't need any new formats or protocols. It's all &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; on both sides. We totally know how to do RSS. It's ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about this a few years ago was Substack. I wanted to publish a nightly email newsletter from what I had posted that day on my blog, but I didn't have the patience to copy and paste and then reformat the text, by hand, when I already have that automated. They wanted to turn me into a computer. I tried that with Medium for a couple of years and it was awful. No thanks. What I needed them to have support Inbound RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. You now know all there is to know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Inbound%20RSS%22&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS&lt;/a&gt;. 😀 &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But until they deliver on replaceability, it's a 5-alarm fire because of what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire Twitter's user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided. And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems, starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.</description>

We might even be able to defend ourselves. So it's doubly ridiculous that journalism is leading us to Bluesky, when it is just more of the same with a better story. They're asking us to go deeper into the myth that the most toxic tech ever invented is actually good for us. The thing that feels good is the belief that it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good. In that we are just as deluded as the people who think Trump is a genius who understands business and thus will do a great job of running the world economy, a power no previous president had dared to exercise, not even sure they knew they had such power. The educational institutions that are being attacked by Trump now, should have played a role in creating effective communication systems, as should journalism. I got up on stage at a NYT event a few years back and begged them to compete with Twitter. One or two people in the audience of a few hundred were inspired by the idea, but the follow-up was nil. People are comfortable with the belief that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22baby%20squirrels%22&quot;&gt;baby squirrels&lt;/a&gt; have our interests at heart. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/on-the-media/the-tariff-week-from-hell-JzoHbcF6pdj/&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; On the Media podcast. They're all selling us out, again, and again, and again. It's a loop they'll never get out of. I have friends scattered around the world in places of power. When are we going to work together to create the communication system we need. We're never going to get there by waiting for tech and journalism to get together on this.</description>

I don't think they, or anyone else, realizes how much more this move gives us a chance of building a protected network of communication. Their vision could be achieved much more quickly by giving up their &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22boil%20the%20ocean%22&quot;&gt;boil the ocean&lt;/a&gt; approach and start taking some simple, very doable steps that would empower outside developers to build a rich ecosystem around their product. The only downside would be that now they really &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be replaceable. Anyway, they're partly there. Right now they support outbound RSS, and are improving it. That's the strategically easy half to do. The one that would really open them up is inbound RSS, the protocol that all the other twitter-like systems refuse to support. Want to blow the doors off now instead of some vague time in the future? Support outbound &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; inbound RSS. Let the trains come into the station and leave the station on a well established protocol. It could be done in a few weeks, really. Maybe the very intelligent and curious people who read this blog would like to take the time to understand what this means and the doors it would open? It's a way to change the subject from &quot;good idea but hopeless&quot; to &quot;hey we can have freedom now.&quot;</description>

			<description>To really nail it down, supporting inbound and outbound RSS would justify them saying they are part of the &quot;social web.&quot; Today's Bluesky has no business claiming to be part of the web, the system they're hyping is fully &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/bluesky/&quot;&gt;centralized&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>We were just cogs in the machine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a special high school in NYC, it was a public school you had to take a test to get into. One day our social studies teacher got some gumption, maybe he had a few drinks, or smoked some weed, but he had courage most teachers never had. He told us who we were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of us were going to MIT or some other university that sent workers into the establishment to become cogs in the big wheel that kept the world running. He was right. Although my own path wasn’t that direct, I did get there. I rose to the top in Silicon Valley, then a big famous university. Everything Mr Goldman told us that day was true. But what he probably also saw was that he too was a cog, a tool, a piece of the machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to draw a realistic picture of that day in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970&quot;&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/12/mrGoldmanTellsTheTruth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Mr Goldman lays the hard truth on us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When young people come out of university in a technical subject, they think they know more than people already doing the jobs. They quickly learn that in school they were doing &quot;student projects&quot; which are not the real thing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/radiofreeameri.ca/post/3lmjtnotspv2z&quot;&gt;Ooops&lt;/a&gt;, maybe we didn't know as much as we thought.</description>
