			<title>It's different after its gone</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This post is the summary of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When my mother died in 2018, it didn't settle in that the context in which I lived, my whole life, was gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that house. I hadn't lived there since I went away to college, but it still defined who I was, an adult who didn't live in his childhood home. When we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I can return to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we change our view of the country we live in. It's not that it's about to change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web -- &lt;i&gt;it has already changed. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don't recuse when deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine the president is a monarch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're already living in the authoritarian state we're worried about. We haven't caught up with that reality yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that sink in. If I said you don't own your own body, what would you think I'm talking about? Answer: Slavery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but we'd insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the proof we need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take us for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They play the game exactly as it should be played. And they don't take the bait to make it about anything other than what happens on the court, and to trust in the league to take care of players who don't play by the rules. And &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; the Philadelphia arena was full of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less than NYC tickets, and it's only 2 hours away by car, and there's good train service. If the series goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing will happen. I feel sorry for fans of small town teams, because no matter where you go in the US, there are always lots of Knicks fans. Largest city in the country.</description>

			<description>I keep harping on Kevin Durant, but the thing he didn't understand about New York is that we're a one-team town when it comes to basketball. We'll go to a Nets game if there's nothing else to do, but the Knicks are the story of New York in re basketball.</description>

			<description>If you're running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall&quot;&gt;FeedLand server&lt;/a&gt;, look in the &lt;i&gt;data/riverBuildLogs&lt;/i&gt; folder. A bunch of fairly unnecessary JSON files may be accumulating there. I made a mistake in the default value of a config setting.

I noticed the problem as feedland.org was getting low on disk space. The default is set correctly in the latest release.</description>

If someone I don't know posts a negative comment on Facebook, in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have that feature (other systems don't, they should). Any lurker who happens by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don't know you, I honestly don't care what you think, esp if it's negative and has less than ten syllables total. It's hit and run spam for sure. I'm widening my definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that actually mean anything, it doesn't amount to much. Let's see what the social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.</description>

			<description>I'm also blocking people who hype ActivityPub in comments to my posts about social web stuff that has nothing to do with AP. I've been down this road before. I just want to find people with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;active minds&lt;/a&gt;, whose business is interop, who want to try stuff out. AP is not a good foundation to build on, at least until they come up with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22busy+developer+guide%22&quot;&gt;BDG&lt;/a&gt; for it. Basically it isn't a standard even though they say it is. If you want to help your cause: 1. Stop hyping. 2. Get busy with that BDG.</description>

			<description>A use-case for ChatGPT. You get a hard-to-understand error message from MySQL, so you send the code to ChatGPT and it gives you a perfect error message, and gives you the corrected code. It also can generate SQL from an actual English language description. Quite a loop-close, since SQL was sold as programming in English, just like COBOL or AppleScript, except in ChatGPT you really are using English. It's precise English, but not &quot;marketing&quot; English (ie non-technical managers can be fooled by what they see). An intelligent non-programmer could actually write code, not sure of that of course since I am a programmer myself.</description>

			<description>I love that I can ask ChatGPT how to spell the word &lt;i&gt;exposé&lt;/i&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/b229346f-8a8c-435f-ae56-986d31a16b3d&quot;&gt;literate way&lt;/a&gt;. Google is difficult about it. It tried to erase the word from my query, then gave me the wrong spelling.</description>

			<title>NYT complains, we applaud</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was pleased to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytco.com/press/a-statement-from-the-new-york-times-on-presidential-news-coverage/&quot;&gt;NYT op-ed&lt;/a&gt; complaining that President Biden wouldn't sit for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they blew it when they ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anytimes.com+%22A+sympathetic%2C+well-meaning%2C+elderly+man+with+a+poor+memory%22&quot;&gt;so many stories&lt;/a&gt; quoting a DOJ lawyer explaining why he was not prosecuting Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't forget they did that, as I'm sure President Biden hasn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, the proper DOJ procedure for not charging someone is to say nothing. You might write them a letter to tell them they don't need to prepare to defend themselves. Anything more than that puts your motives in question, and should get you fired as a DOJ attorney. I never saw a NYT article that even asked this question -- who is this person and why should we care what he thinks about Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, is it good journalism to raise an issue of basic competence about the sitting President of the United States without a bit more background and substance? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How is giving credit to such a story journalism? Sounds like trash that would run in the National Enquirer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT has a lot of nerve after covering that &quot;story&quot; so extensively, to demand that Biden sit for an interview. Can you imagine. They'd be reviewing anything but what he said. So disrespectful of our president.  And so disrespectful of the Americans who elected him. If you want to raise an issue, come prepared with some journalism to back it up. That's what we expect from the NYT, not what we got from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: On the other hand, thanks to the NYT for posting this on their own website. The often used Medium in the past for statements like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Do you remember when you first realized that people weren't talking to you in a response to your post, they were talking over your shoulder to the people who read your post. I guess it depends on who you are, but I don't see any value in providing a surface for spam. These days I block people without much thought if I think that's what they're doing. So, why should you design a protocol, and pay the cost of supporting, something that is a vector for spam and abuse? That's the argument in favor of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; to glue things together. You can comment on my post, in your space, but my followers don't have to see it. That's up to me. I think it would change the nature of discourse, for the better.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT has memory across chats. This just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptmessage.png&quot;&gt;popped up&lt;/a&gt; on the screen. I'd like to tell it that until further notice I use Node.js and do not use Express, and do use jQuery for my browser-based JavaScript, and I use the debugger all the time, so you can assume that. If this works, I now have a programming partner with memory. And maybe I can somehow get it to read all my blog posts going back 30 years? I have good archives of most of it. Also, of course I &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptcomments.png&quot;&gt;fed this post&lt;/a&gt; to ChatGPT of course. So ChatGPT is not resting on its laurels. That's good. I'd really like a &lt;i&gt;Personal ChatGPT, &lt;/i&gt;and this is on the way to that goal.</description>

			<title>FeedLand and WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll&quot;&gt;new plugin&lt;/a&gt; that adds a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; to a WordPress site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be helpful if people who are regular readers of Scripting News who use WordPress, set up a test site, give it a try and let us know how it goes. You can help us get to the next level with this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So there are two sides, the FeedLand side and the WordPress side.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The FeedLand side&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?signonscreen=true&quot;&gt;Sign on&lt;/a&gt; to FeedLand, create an account if you don't have one, and subscribe to a bunch of feeds. These will be the feeds in your blogroll.  There are some tips on how to find feeds, in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/24/132025.html#a134443&quot;&gt;next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The WordPress side&lt;/b&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll&quot;&gt;new plugin&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the people at the Team51 group at Automattic. They have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll/blob/trunk/README.md&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; for how to install the plugin in a WordPress site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can get ideas for feeds for your blogroll from reading other people's feed lists. When you see a checkbox that isn't checked, you can subscribe to the feed simply by checking the box. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt; for ideas. Here's a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?userslist&quot;&gt;recent users&lt;/a&gt;, click on their names to see their feed lists. You don't have to finish this now, you can come back and tune this up anytime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Developers: Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandBlogrollToolkit&quot;&gt;feedlandBlogrollToolkit&lt;/a&gt; to add blogrolls to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, or need help getting it working, post a note in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll/discussions/15&quot;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was chatting with a friend who went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science&quot;&gt;Bronx Science&lt;/a&gt;, as I did, and we were talking about Isaac Asimov, and I said I thought he went to Science too. So I fired up ChatGPT and asked if Asimov went to Science, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/81199c5a-ca0a-4a2c-b610-e0799722a03f&quot;&gt;it said yes&lt;/a&gt;. Then I asked where he went to high school and it said Bronx Science. But by then I was pretty sure he didn't, so I went to Google and meta.ai, and neither knew where he went to high school. So I asked on Twitter, Mastodon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112321321415008740&quot;&gt;Blue Sky&lt;/a&gt; and Threads. Not sure why I even care!

			<description>I don't have time to write about it now but the end of last night's Knicks game was one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VUvcuHwgtw&quot;&gt;most dramatic bits&lt;/a&gt; of NY sports ever.

			<title>Quiet mode for the blogroll</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After living with the blogroll on the home page of Scripting News for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html&quot;&gt;about a month&lt;/a&gt;, and having heard from early testers, I felt that it was demanding too much attention when I was reading stuff on the blog. So I made some time last week to experiment with a subtler sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet Mode,&lt;/i&gt; the blogroll doesn't call attention to itself until you click on it. Then its background changes from neutral to white. That's the equivalent of shining a spotlight on it. Also the borders become blue to indicate that the browser's focus is on the blogroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do more to tone it down. So, in Quiet Mode the title moves up and to the left, and is in a much smaller font, boldface, nicely visible and stands off from the list, but doesn't call your attention to it. It's there when you want to know more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You may want to call it something other than a blogroll, btw. If you're using blogs to coordinate projects with others, something I think a lot more people would do if it worked better, instead of &quot;blogroll&quot; you'd might call it your &quot;workgroup.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have switched &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; over to the new quiet mode, it's already the default, but I put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/20/checkbox.png&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/a&gt; just below the blogroll that lets you toggle between the two modes to see the difference and possibly spot problems. The checkbox will go away before long. I just want it there to quickly do an A-B comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zfNS97NUHB4&quot;&gt;quick video demo&lt;/a&gt; of Quiet Mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/304&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment or ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The two concepts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality&quot;&gt;orthogonal&lt;/a&gt;. I do not support the Israeli government any more than I supported the government of my country, the United States, when the MAGAs were in charge. We lost over 1 million Americans who did not have to die imho, because our government was not only immoral and hugely corrupt, but also made no attempt to govern. I am a child of Holocaust survivors and an American born in the USA, and am proud of and grateful to my country. Any American is free to protest the actions of our government or any other government, or really anything. If you don't believe in that then you aren't actually trying to make America great, you're saying something altogether different and incompatible. I am American. I am also deeply offended at other Americans who propose to speak for me. That actually is antisemitic, btw.</description>

			<description>Quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.ai/&quot;&gt;meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;. This is a demo of just one feature, its ability to recalc drawings as you edit the prompt that defines the picture. As you can tell from the demo I love it because it's new, creative, super fun to use and to watch the result. And lovely to see this much progress so quickly. You really should watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; so you can see how what I type relates to the image in real-time. It's like subtitles inverted, with a very knowledgeable, creative and high bandwidth computer network behind it. Living in the future.</description>

			<title>WordPress For One</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;More and more I'm getting used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; as the platform I develop for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you, as a developer, could add your own data to a WordPress post. Then you could build editors that work at a higher level. For example, you'd keep the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html?title=markdownIsJustEnoughHtml&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; source for the page. When it was saved the system would re-render the Markdown, turning it into HTML, but you'd still have the Markdown around for editing. And of course there are other kinds of editors that make sense, knowing that the output is going to the web, but you don't have to &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; in the technical language of the web. You might want something more suited to wordsmiths -- ie &lt;i&gt;writers, &lt;/i&gt;if you are a writer. I have that working here, and have been building on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've gone back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/radio/screenshots.opml?permalink=20240219144035&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; and tried to extrapolate, where would we have gone with that product, 22 years later. And now I'm beginning to see in the pieces that are forming the new product I've been working on, something whole, something that works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of it as &quot;WordPress For One&quot; -- you might be writing as part of a larger site, but this is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; writing space, a place you can mold to fit your style, where it gets more comfortable over the years, more you. That's what I've felt has been wrong with the direction the web has been going in, we're getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;boxed&lt;/a&gt; into smaller and smaller spaces, but for some of my writing I want a nice stage with good lighting and full freedom to tell a story that I have to tell, not necessarily all at once, but possibly in a series, over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also want to be influenced by your story. I want &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;Working Together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course I still very much develop for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, and in the back of my mind I want to loop back around to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; (it's my main writing environment), and then I have another product I call Belter I want to finish. And I wouldn't mind trying to make a CSS thing that makes more sense than the tragedy CSS is, and also would love to see a port of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; to Linux, though I don't see doing that myself, but I would like to guide it (so it runs all the old stuff first). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just spent a few minutes with &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.ai/&quot;&gt;meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook's answer to ChatGPT, and it's really good. The drawing functionality recalcs while you're entering the prompt, so if you type, &quot;vary gender, age and race,&quot; and as you type each word, the image changes.</description>

How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more &lt;i&gt;fluidity. &lt;/i&gt;Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't. So they got all the casual writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I think it's time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on features and lock-in.</description>

			<description>In the past, when I have tried to make other people's products better, it often doesn't go very well. The archive of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; is filled with great examples. Yet I, as they say, persist. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I just tripped across this &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2009/12/12/wordpress-com-implements-the-twitter-api-2/&quot;&gt;post from 2009&lt;/a&gt; where Matt had sent me an email saying they were supporting the Twitter API in WordPress. I had forgotten this. That's how long it's been that he's wanted to hook WP up to the social web. It doesn't look like I posted that to Scripting News. I wonder what other nuggets of forgotten history I'll find there.</description>
