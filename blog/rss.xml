I don't think in general software interfaces should be liberal with what they understand because that defeats the first half. They sort of zero each other out.</description>

			<description>People may question my credentials as a language designer. I've designed a very innovative system that unfortunately the academics don't think is worth studying. It's utterly ridiculous. Who says you can only learn from systems developed at big companies or universities. I cover a lot of ground, it's true -- no one gave me permission to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn't feel I needed permission. Or funding for that matter. I think what happened is Apple positioned us as less significant than their system scripting language, and people just accepted that, when Frontier is a far superior system. Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier&quot;&gt;ideas are there&lt;/a&gt; anyway, and you're welcome to learn from them.</description>

			<title>Government should work quietly</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I kept waiting for Kamala to say what we're not going back to is Trump. We've paid our dues. He's had enough of our attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Government should do its work quietly, making things better for the people and that's all, and until there's a crisis that demands our attention, stays out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/02/ygritte.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Keep the drama on Netflix and HBO.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My friend who I don't understand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most depressing thing last night for me was reading that a longtime friend voted for the worst candidate they've ever voted for because the other one was worse. They wouldn’t say who they actually voted for. This is what we’ll be left with as a country when all this is done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave another $100 to Harris to compensate, and of course voted straight Democratic on Thursday. Unlike my friend I was proud to vote for her. The alternative, after what we lived through between 2017 and 2021, to choose to go through that again, hard to imagine the horror.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course that’s assuming he voted for Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Unfortunately the only place you can read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/pfbid0VqEwJyLQQ7Qyhu9Zoz6ivz35APRfvLMKp7wBZvR2pDRTVdLwf1QR8Xh646faRJ1Zl&quot;&gt;Dan Conover piece&lt;/a&gt; is on Facebook about the failure of the NY Times and Washington Post to adequately defend democracy. He says something I had not seen elsewhere. &quot;We're not talking about HuffPo or Salon here. We're talking about the last two 'unique nationals' standing in American print journalism. Institutions with long and storied histories. Both took the same test at the same time, and both failed it.&quot; I'd add that all other journalism usually follows their lead, but that may be finally changing.</description>

			<description>Meanwhile, it's amazing that both CNN and MSNBC have gotten serious about covering the reality of Trump 2.0 after being very unserious for the last year. It's as if after rejecting Joe Biden, months later they realized they rejected the wrong guy.</description>

Because it's one of the divisions that's maintained by people who are mostly Democrats. If you want to know if you're part of the problem, measure your own feelings when you find out what it's about. And then listen, carefully to the words. It might be hard to hear because I think most people who do this don't think they do, or they're justified in doing it. They don't want to look here. But the pragmatic reason to focus on this is that in future elections, assuming we have them, if we can make an effort to not do this, we could get enough Republican votes to switch to make real change possible. They might even become our most vocal supporters. Winning in politics is done by focusing on common interests over division.</description>
