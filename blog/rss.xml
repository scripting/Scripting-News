			<description>One more thing, people are posting Trump's vicious eulogy for Reiner and his wife. Why are they helping him piss on the fresh memory of the life of these people who gave us so much. Stop and think before you express your outrage at Trump, and realize you're giving him exactly what he wants, as you tarnish the memory of good-hearted and generous people. Just don't do it.</description>

			<description>I asked ChatGPT: &quot;Has anyone ported &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt; in the form of something you can include in a browser-based JavaScript app?&quot; No. I wish the answer was yes, so I could create UIs that are at least as good as the stuff we did in the 1980s on the Mac, inside a web browser. I keep learning new ways simple things are impossible in CSS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics)&quot;&gt;Clipping&lt;/a&gt; for example, is torture.</description>

			<title>Ann Greenberg's idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?notif_id=1765601890685451&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook in 2021 about an app I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was yesterday. Today I found myself writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?comment_id=1586870055654260&amp;reply_comment_id=881509054436484&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that was really a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anngreenberg.com/&quot;&gt;Ann Greenberg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anngreenberg.com/inventions&quot;&gt;visionary&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anngreenberg/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to explain this to me almost 20 years ago and my mind couldn't comprehend the possibility. but ann, don't take it personally -- i don't even listen to myself. i have spent most of this year struggling with a problem i solved in 2014. there was like this moment, omg this is exactly what i tried to do with twitter, but now i have control of the api, so i can actually make it work. my gift to you Ann is this -- we all should've listened to you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at that point in our lives I think when reaching out like this is totally the right thing to do. Because it's only until this point that things quiet down enough that you can realize things like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, the idea of a comment not being a blog post will require a lot of explanation in a few years. Imho of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder if the VCs would fund an entirely fictitious implementation of Twitter with AI of course. All the other people are AI designed actors, and can be exactly the kind of people who make &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; feel good. On &quot;Your Own Twitter&quot; you'd have the most followers of anyone. Elon Musk would kiss your ass. You could change reality at will, have Trump removed from office and watch the MAGAs wail in pain. You could say absolutely whatever you like and never be cancelled. Don't laugh, I bet this happens.</description>

			<description>Without much of a spoiler, this end of this week's Pluribus was both emotional and exciting at the same time. Didn't see it coming. People complain because after the first two or three episodes they thought it was going to be an adventure, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Last of Us&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;, but it turned out to, at least for now, be more thoughtful and emotional, and sexy.</description>

And if you follow my sports writing here, mostly about the Knicks and Mets, I almost never say a team was wrong. I can usually see a pro and a con to everything. WIth the Mets, I let the team run itself, and ponder the philosophical intentions and manifestations, because to me the Mets are the team built on philosophy. It certainly was not built on winning. And yet we love them. There's no winning in life, that's reality. So we try to find meaning on the days and hours we have remaining. And the Mets are great teachers, as are the Knicks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- why did the Mets have such a shit season?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because they disrespected &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso&quot;&gt;Pete Alonso&lt;/a&gt; last winter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He should have been the glue that held the team together along with Nimmo, Diaz, and all the other much-loved players. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We still think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor&quot;&gt;Lindor&lt;/a&gt; as the new guy. Now all you have left for leadership is Lindor and Soto who obviously doesn't even want to be there. It's was a broken team before the news, and now it's not even a team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A team isn't a bunch of stats and a bunch of money, it's the players, the people. You can't solve this problem with a spreadsheet, it has to be done with heart. These days I think of the Mets just trying to be the Yankees which aside from being impossible, is pretty much the exact reason we're Mets fans and not Yankees fans. Ohhh, when will they learn. I don't want a team built to win the World Series. I want a team built to respect the team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, the big news was they traded Nimmo, and let Alonso and Diaz sign with other teams. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I go to the supermarket I'm reminded of how scary the times are. People want to just &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/factpostnews.bsky.social/post/3m7ngrmymxk2y&quot;&gt;live their lives&lt;/a&gt;, never has that been more understandable, but food prices are a constant reminder for everyone there's good reason to be scared. And if you want to really feel it, imagine what happens if we somehow let Trump flood the economy with dollars. Talk about a recipe for disruption, this time, of our lives, not just some kind of PC or network or game software.</description>

Some parts are confusing, some are poorly edited. They try to have a shocker or cliff hanger at the end of episodes, but they aren't very shocking and the cliff turns out to be something so obvious that you could swear they already told us that. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=valsk3cd9gc&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;exquisitly crafted TV&lt;/a&gt;. The incredible shots they took, many of them were works of art all on their own. Maybe it was the combination of factors. The skill of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilligan&quot;&gt;Vince Gilligan's&lt;/a&gt; team, combined with our admiration for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_Seehorn&quot;&gt;Rhea Seehorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the gravitas of Apple TV and one of the other great shows of our time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=severance&quot;&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt;. That made the conclusion obvious, by lineage this must be the &lt;i&gt;best show ever. &lt;/i&gt;It's always that way, in sports for example. You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But! I am hooked, I love the show, it's hard to imagine anything could get me to not reserve Thurs at 9PM to watch the latest episode, all I ask is no more humans eating dog food. Please, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was too much. It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</description>

That made the conclusion obvious, by lineage this must be the _best show ever._ It's always that way, in sports for example. You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But! I am hooked, I love the show, it's hard to imagine anything could get me to not reserve Thurs at 9PM to watch the latest episode, all I ask is no more humans eating dog food. Please, _that_ was too much. It's sad however that there are only two episodes left in this season, but then comes all the holiday releases, and this year it seems most of it is on streaming services, not in theaters.</source:markdown>
			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt; is not, at least so far, equal to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad&quot;&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;. Some parts are confusing, some are poorly edited. They try to have a shocker or cliff hanger at the end of episodes, but they aren't very shocking and the cliff turns out to be something so obvious that you could swear they already told us that. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=valsk3cd9gc&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;exquisitly crafted TV&lt;/a&gt;. The incredible shots they took, many of them were works of art all on their own. Maybe it was the combination of factors.

			<description>People using &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?river=true&amp;screenname=scripting&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt; -- may notice that some old items will appear in your timelines. I just installed a version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; on that server that does a better job of figuring out if a feed item has changed. There will be fewer false positives, which makes the software considerably more efficient, and means that you don't have to see things that didn't change. It should settle down fairly quickly, but it may be a little chatty for a while. Still diggin! (Also these changes will come to feedland.com as well.)</description>

			<description>Funny thing about yesterday's Supreme Court decision, if Texas goes ahead with their gerrymandering plan, it probably will backfire on them, cause them to lose a few seats instead of gain them.

			<title>Flip switches</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In software, I like to have multiple ways to view the same data. In one context it's an outline, then flip a switch and now it's a graphic.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; shipped at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22living%20videotext%22&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac in 1986. You start with an outline and flip a switch to turn it into a tree chart. Flip it back to make a change, then flip it again to see the change in a tree chart. Or flip the outline to reveal a set of presentation slides. People loved the idea that they could create graphics entirely by writing and reorganizing and then flipping a switch. That was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application&quot;&gt;killer feature&lt;/a&gt; in the demos we did at trade shows. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/04/ucsdPascal.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Before that in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=lbbs&quot;&gt;LBBS&lt;/a&gt;, a bulletin board system I wrote and ran on an Apple II in my Menlo Park living room in the early 80s, I had two views of the message structure, reverse chronologic and a hierarchic thread structure.

Readers might not know that they're reading something that has a dual life as a comment linked to someone else's post. There can be a flip-switch in both views that lets you go back and forth. I can only guarantee that the flip switch will be in my software, since this will be an open network, there can be any number of different ways to view the content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; famous once &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/26/letathousandflowersbloom.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Let a thousand flowers bloom.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why should comment writing not have all the features of blog post writing?

The problems cascaded from there, long story, but in the end I had to move one of my virtual-virtual servers (two levels of virtuality) to another virtual server. Upgrading versions of Node is a tricky process that I have never mastered or understood, and every time it takes almost a full day to do it. Something I hope to someday be able to find the time to sort out. Not today, though -- I have a fun project planned out. Really looking forward to doing the work and seeing the result.</description>

			<title>Pluribus spoilers below</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories on what's actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a love story between Carol and Zosia. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; fall in love with a person with no sense of self. They plotted to have Helen killed, and waited until Carol's &quot;f*ckable&quot; judgment turns into real love. They get married and everyone lives happily ever after.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Alternate theory -- the original people are still in their bodies, suppressed to keep quiet. Inside they're screaming to be saved, as pissed off as Carol. They want their bodies back. They have the ability to write messages on their skin, so what Carol saw at the end of the last episode was a corpse with the words HELP ME! visible on the body's belly.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another alternate theory about the end of the last episode -- it took a moment for Carol to recognize her own body, possibly dead, and realizing this is all a dream. It's another version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, where this is the fake reality that we've been seeing. None of this is really happening. (Like the end of the Bob Newhart show?)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also is Plur1bus like Saul Goodman, in that if you say it a different way it has a message encoded? The 1 instead of an i seems like a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<source:markdown>Theories on what's actually going on.&#10;&#10;*   It's a love story between Carol and Zosia. You _can_ fall in love with a person with no sense of self. They plotted to have Helen killed, and waited until Carol's &quot;f\*ckable&quot; judgment turns into real love. They get married and everyone lives happily ever after.&#10;*   Alternate theory -- the original people are still in their bodies, suppressed to keep quiet. Inside they're screaming to be saved, as pissed off as Carol. They want their bodies back. They have the ability to write messages on their skin, so what Carol saw at the end of the last episode was a corpse with the words HELP ME! visible on the body's belly.&#10;*   Another alternate theory about the end of the last episode -- it took a moment for Carol to recognize her own body, possibly dead, and realizing this is all a dream. It's another version of [The Matrix](https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22), where this is the fake reality that we've been seeing. None of this is really happening. (Like the end of the Bob Newhart show?)&#10;&#10;Also is Plur1bus like Saul Goodman, in that if you say it a different way it has a message encoded? The 1 instead of an i seems like a clue.</source:markdown>
