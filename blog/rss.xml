			<description>Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner&quot;&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this, say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</description>

			<description>Even if Congress doesn't do anything to rein in Musk and Trump, the stock market will have something to say on Monday, one assumes. And this might be one time to hope for a market crash.</description>

			<description>I rewrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;oursocialweb.org&lt;/a&gt; home page. It needed to focus on linking. The term web is being thrown around too casually, without regard to what the web is, the same kind of dilution that's happening with podcasting. But the &lt;i&gt;social web&lt;/i&gt; idea is fairly new, and it's really important that we get this right.</description>

Will there be any tech companies that aren't wholly owned by Musk, Inc. Will owning things even mean anything? Or is this the beginning of the rule of the tech bros, world wide. I can't imagine what they're planning for us. In the meantime, me divesting my Tesla, which seemed so urgent just 24 hours ago, now seems like a powerless gesture. I heard it said that now feels like the moment in Covid when you realized everything was about to freeze, and you'd better head to the supermarket right now, and when you got there, you found you weren't among the first to see it this way. I was very reassured by the blog post that Krugman did. It's nice to hear a sane voice out there.</description>

			<description>Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/01.opml&quot;&gt;month&lt;/a&gt;, starting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml/2025&quot;&gt;new year&lt;/a&gt; in the archive on GitHub. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml/2024&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt; is complete. We've been following this pattern long enough. I wish GitHub had existed in 1994, and I wish we understood how to use it sooner than we did. Onward!</description>
