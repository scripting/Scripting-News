I tried Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, none of them even understood the question of how to get Bluesky to add the data. I was amazed to learn that each developer has to do it for themselves, that this isn't something they built into their server. Anyway, I'm halfway there.</description>

			<description>The AI world would have done much better with a president like Biden than we will with Trump. AI is a very potent tool for surveillance. Completely changes the game. And if it were just Trump and not Musk we'd have a chance, but Musk and Thiel fully understand the power, and probably already have all the code written, they just need the database records to scan and now they have all of them. Eventually we'll be talking about the &quot;peaceful uses of AI&quot; as we do about nuclear tech. But just saying that will get you punished.</description>

			<description>Another thing to watch while you still can, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others&quot;&gt;The Lives of Others&lt;/a&gt;, about life in East Germany during the Cold War.</description>

It was used to shame a Democrat who was doing a great job of explaining the danger, Sen Murphy of Connecticut. I switched to basketball in disgust, thinking these people, CNN, they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&quot;&gt;not serious people&lt;/a&gt;. This problem isn't on the Dems, it's on all of us, and it always was. To pin it on the Dems is to say it's hopeless because right now they're just our representatives in Congress and some of our state governments. We have a big problem and we probably can't dig out of it, but if we have any hope at all, orgs like CNN have to stop being such idiots. Every so often I see a spark of brilliance over there, and then one of these things happens. What's more depressing, Trump or CNN? CNN by a lot. And the NYT and all the rest of the broken media. We are all in the same boat.</description>

			<description>In January I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/myAppList/&quot;&gt;an online diary&lt;/a&gt; where I list each of the apps I manage, as I work on them. When I work on one, I move it to the top. The notes are brief and to anyone but me might seem cryptic. But at least you can follow what I'm doing. No I don't plan to do an RSS feed for it. It's just a place to keep track of all the things I work on, for people who I work with, and most important, me.</description>

			<title>Idea for news orgs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do 1000 profiles of federal workers being attacked by Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Don't use real names. Have AI provide real-looking photos of fictitious people. Explain what they do. Don't focus on their lives. Make readers think of what life will be like without them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have done this a long time ago, when Reagan said, arrogantly, the government is the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That should have been rebutted, strongly and regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to learn what they actually do, all of them, at least understand what we're going to live without.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to try it out. &quot;I want to tell a story about a typical person who works for the US government. It shouldn't be a glamorous job, but an important one. It should improve people's lives, health, happiness, fulfillment. Pick the role at random, as well as gender, age, race, geography. Write a 100 word job description, and  provide a realistic looking profile picture. Nothing about their personal life, or actual name, but it's okay to talk about the required education and experience for the job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what it came back with: &quot;An Environmental Health Officer (EHO) plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health by identifying and mitigating environmental hazards. Employed by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EHOs conduct inspections of facilities like restaurants, swimming pools, and nursing homes to ensure compliance with health regulations. They investigate complaints related to air and water quality, noise, and waste management, and implement measures to prevent disease outbreaks. A bachelor's degree in environmental health or a related field is typically required, with many positions preferring candidates with a master's degree. Professional certification, such as Registered Environmental Health Specialist (REHS), is often preferred. Strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate effectively are essential for success in this role.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/06/theThreeEhos.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Our three Environment Health Officers (not actual people).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Employed by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EHOs conduct inspections of facilities like restaurants, swimming pools, and nursing homes to ensure compliance with health regulations. They investigate complaints related to air and water quality, noise, and waste management, and implement measures to prevent disease outbreaks. A bachelor's degree in environmental health or a related field is typically required, with many positions preferring candidates with a master's degree.

It made me wonder if any of the readers of my blog voted for Trump. I can't imagine too many did, unless they've been willing to overlook my strenuous support for any option that opposes him. However if any of you are still here, I'd like you to know that what's happening now is exactly what we thought &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; happen. If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he's doing to our system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk's chaos becomes more and more real.</description>

			<description>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22&quot;&gt;Suggested User List&lt;/a&gt; that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course &lt;i&gt;publicly owned&lt;/i&gt; now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.</description>

You hope the cancer doesn't kill you, and swear to never smoke again if you're lucky enough to survive it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time, when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start trying to get their attention, which hasn't happened yet, it's going to be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis isn't good. But we should get our shit together asap because it's our only hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.</description>

			<description>A bit of advice for Dems in Congress. Go home and have town halls, and listen. And stop listening to the consultants and each other.

			<description>I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.</description>

			<description>I rewrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;oursocialweb.org&lt;/a&gt; home page. It needed to focus on linking. The term web is being thrown around too casually, without regard to what the web is, the same kind of dilution that's happening with podcasting. But the &lt;i&gt;social web&lt;/i&gt; idea is fairly new, and it's really important that we get this right.</description>
