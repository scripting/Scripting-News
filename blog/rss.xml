One &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/07/04/181125.html&quot;&gt;simple way&lt;/a&gt; would be to hook RSS up to ActivityPub, turning Mastodon and Threads into a big feed reader. It could easily be done in software, it would just take money to keep it running. Not something I could attempt personally. But I would totally help with the software and design. It would open the door for lots of new apps that could communicate with users through a single &lt;i&gt;simple&lt;/i&gt; API. I want to talk with people about this at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/22/132405.html&quot;&gt;WordCamp Canada&lt;/a&gt; in October.</description>

			<description>How odd on Independence Day a law goes into effect that funds a secret police for the US. The goal is to flow people from inside the United States into concentration camps, and ostensibly deport them to other countries. It may turn out to be easier and less expensive to just gas them and burn the bodies right here in the USA. I listened to this morning's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-the-megabill-will-change-america/id1200361736?i=1000715713632&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; to hear how they summed up the bill. They focused on taxes and health care as most of the other news orgs have been doing. They were puzzled why the Repubs didn't seem to care if it hurt their electorate, but they didn't state the obvious answer. They &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; care. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/22/123759.html?title=weNeedOccamsNews&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;. I guess they didn't want to say it out loud so they just telegraphed the question. It worked, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lt2zupgbm22n&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; received.</description>

			<title>RSS ==&gt; ActivityPub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see a bridge from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; to ActivityPub. I've asked people at various companies if they'd do this. I'm happy to help with the software but operating the service is something for a trusted company to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this would go all the way to putting the &quot;open&quot; in open social web, because people who already know how to build RSS feeds would be able to quickly write apps that hook into AP networks. And of course it wouldn't have to be limited to RSS, it could build on Atom and RDF equally well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It think it's tragic that it's taking Ghost, for example, so long to get their service up fully, and it suggests that smaller devs don't stand a chance. I can't wake up one day and have an idea of something that would work well with Mastodon, for example, and have a prototype running the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think this is a good idea, post a link to this post somewhere developers live, and let's see if we can get a cooperative project up and running. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if you don't like RSS, Atom or RDF, invent an orthogonal format and we can work with that too. I know people have strong feelings about this stuff, not a problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/114796352889094954&quot;&gt;Tim Bray&lt;/a&gt; to comment, and  he &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/114796687727557412&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds good. We've known each other for decades, going back to the early days of XML. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My new linkblog feed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the address of my linkblog feed: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dave.linkblog.org/&quot;&gt;dave.linkblog.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it's kind of interesting to have the top page of a site be a feed. I don't hide the XML-ness of it. I never supported the obfuscation, it's confusing, makes people not trust RSS, imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the feed is pretty stable now, so if you want to subscribe, go ahead. I haven't redirected from the old feed yet, probably should do that soon, since it more or less has stopped updating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is all managed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; and therefore is part of the WordPress ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt it was time to do a definitive linkblog, since as far as I could tell no one has tried to explain what it is: basically, a feed where the &amp;lt;link&gt; element of each &amp;lt;item&gt; points to some other site. That's the basic difference.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also a linkblog feed should specify the channel-level &amp;lt;image&gt; element, which is used as the avatar for the feed when it appears in a twitter-like timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the only other product that is open to feeds being part of the open social web is &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.flipboard.com/press/announcing-surf-the-first-browser-for-the-open-social-web/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;&gt;Surf&lt;/a&gt; from Mike McCue's company, Flipboard. I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/6863cadb-46ec-8012-9ec8-c5e67595f954&quot;&gt;brief me&lt;/a&gt; on how it works with feeds, and saw that we're more or less doing the same thing, except I'm not trying to work with the output from Twitter, Bluesky, etc. Even when they have outbound RSS feeds they aren't good enough to be part of the social web defined by feeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I only want really good feeds. It's time to stop being so careless about what we transmit to the world. If we want an open web we're all going to have to be good gardeners. It's like a food system where all the food is grown by family farmers and I'm running a restaurant, and only want the good stuff, and we want it to look good too! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another thing, the feed items must have working &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;guids&lt;/a&gt;. All software that runs on feeds should be able to depend on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Linkblogs aren't the only kinds of feeds that will be used in this RSS-based feediverse. Scripting News will work with it. You would be able to read this post in this new medium (not yet delivered, btw).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: More &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/davewiner/myLinkblog.opml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandDev/issues/1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
