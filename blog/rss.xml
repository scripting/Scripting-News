It's got a lot of advantages. It does the basics of social media. It scales, is mature, stable, and well-managed. A stronger, stable, more broad and better foundation imho to build on than the others.</description>

Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But until they deliver on replaceability, it's a 5-alarm fire because of what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire Twitter's user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided. And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems, starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.</description>

We might even be able to defend ourselves. So it's doubly ridiculous that journalism is leading us to Bluesky, when it is just more of the same with a better story. They're asking us to go deeper into the myth that the most toxic tech ever invented is actually good for us. The thing that feels good is the belief that it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good. In that we are just as deluded as the people who think Trump is a genius who understands business and thus will do a great job of running the world economy, a power no previous president had dared to exercise, not even sure they knew they had such power. The educational institutions that are being attacked by Trump now, should have played a role in creating effective communication systems, as should journalism. I got up on stage at a NYT event a few years back and begged them to compete with Twitter. One or two people in the audience of a few hundred were inspired by the idea, but the follow-up was nil. People are comfortable with the belief that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22baby%20squirrels%22&quot;&gt;baby squirrels&lt;/a&gt; have our interests at heart. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/on-the-media/the-tariff-week-from-hell-JzoHbcF6pdj/&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; On the Media podcast. They're all selling us out, again, and again, and again. It's a loop they'll never get out of. I have friends scattered around the world in places of power. When are we going to work together to create the communication system we need. We're never going to get there by waiting for tech and journalism to get together on this.</description>

I don't think they, or anyone else, realizes how much more this move gives us a chance of building a protected network of communication. Their vision could be achieved much more quickly by giving up their &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22boil%20the%20ocean%22&quot;&gt;boil the ocean&lt;/a&gt; approach and start taking some simple, very doable steps that would empower outside developers to build a rich ecosystem around their product. The only downside would be that now they really &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be replaceable. Anyway, they're partly there. Right now they support outbound RSS, and are improving it. That's the strategically easy half to do. The one that would really open them up is inbound RSS, the protocol that all the other twitter-like systems refuse to support. Want to blow the doors off now instead of some vague time in the future? Support outbound &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; inbound RSS. Let the trains come into the station and leave the station on a well established protocol. It could be done in a few weeks, really. Maybe the very intelligent and curious people who read this blog would like to take the time to understand what this means and the doors it would open? It's a way to change the subject from &quot;good idea but hopeless&quot; to &quot;hey we can have freedom now.&quot;</description>

			<description>To really nail it down, supporting inbound and outbound RSS would justify them saying they are part of the &quot;social web.&quot; Today's Bluesky has no business claiming to be part of the web, the system they're hyping is fully &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/bluesky/&quot;&gt;centralized&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>We were just cogs in the machine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a special high school in NYC, it was a public school you had to take a test to get into. One day our social studies teacher got some gumption, maybe he had a few drinks, or smoked some weed, but he had courage most teachers never had. He told us who we were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of us were going to MIT or some other university that sent workers into the establishment to become cogs in the big wheel that kept the world running. He was right. Although my own path wasn’t that direct, I did get there. I rose to the top in Silicon Valley, then a big famous university. Everything Mr Goldman told us that day was true. But what he probably also saw was that he too was a cog, a tool, a piece of the machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to draw a realistic picture of that day in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970&quot;&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/12/mrGoldmanTellsTheTruth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Mr Goldman lays the hard truth on us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why we all have to be working &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt; on creating a modern easily distributed communication system that's truly decentralized. The key is to only implement features that have super-simple implementations, so it will be easy to product new versions quickly in all environments. Which means starting with formats and protocols that are already widely supported.</description>

			<description>This morning ChatGPT told me it knows more about me, and will learn better. Promises promises. I would like to begin with teaching it my coding conventions. Will make it &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; easier for me to work with it. Their idea of how JavaScript works is disorganized bordering on chaos. I find that human developers always find a reason not to listen to other people, and that has huge problems (like no interop), but machines should do better. It seems to have infinite patience. What I need is to share a bit of space with the bot, so I can keep it up to date on my worknotes. I'm pretty good at it these days. Why not let that be input into the system so I can say -- give me all the notes I have on my Bingeworthy project. Why should I have to copy/paste. This is a big problem in the web, products that pretend to be islands, when they're really all floating on the same sea, the internet. We were supposed to be able to network not only our attention, but also our work.</description>

			<description>If I were a sassy Democratic Party leader I'd cop to being woke. &quot;Why yes I am woke. Aren't you?&quot; The Repubs have never explained why it's bad to be awake. Dems have to learn how to engage to win. Another one -- &quot;read, fire, aim&quot; is how Trump leads, just look at the tariffs, and it's been a huge disaster for hard-working American wage-earners of all generations. The &quot;all generations&quot; part opens an interesting conversation, how it isn't just old people or young people, it's also people who are working today whose earnings are being stolen, and those of us who have been working for 50 years who were paying into a fund so we could benefit when we retire. That money is coming out of your paycheck with no intention of ever paying it back. That's the Republican-run America. Not so great.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;All Trump is doing is making the US the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooties&quot;&gt;cootie&lt;/a&gt; zone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We won't make anything here and we won't buy anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We'll have nice 2025 computers, phones, cars, medicine, lumber, energy, but all the shit we import will break and be used up and we won't be able to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the world will wonder why they cared so much about the US, as the world gets along just fine without us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that $1 trillion military budget, forget it -- not only did they fire everyone at the IRS, but no one is making any money so there aren't actually any taxes to pay, and there sure as hell aren't any tariffs because no one can afford to buy anything produced anywhere, in the US or the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We become a very sad, poor, sick, uneducated country, but -- Trump will be on Mount Rushmore and his face will be on the $20 bill, which no one sees because no one has $20.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And thus, dear friends, America has become Great Again!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The big vision behind WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that eventually WordPress will be the hub for writers the way the web itself became the the hub for apps. Initially, the web wasn’t the best place to host apps, the Mac had a much more developed set of meaningful features for app devs, and we already knew the Mac APIs where the web was strange and incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet most of the energy in AppLand quickly shifted to the web because of three advantages it had:  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone could publish for it, there was no platform vendor.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The networking model was open and simple, where the Mac's was hidden behind incomplete and poorly written docs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Mac's networking only worked on the Mac at a time when Windows was becoming dominant, and the web offered simplicity that neither platform could match.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web made writing network apps a joy, where the Mac made it a slog. No matter how much time you spent developing, it never resulted in success. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was no question for me when I saw the web, I had to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Substack and Ghost are like Mac and Windows at the dawn of the web. Their big mistake imho is they weren’t built on WordPress, which can and should imho serve as the base platform for writing on the web. If an ecosystem of writing tools is built on the Wordpress foundation how could silo’d writing tools hope to compete? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you question the choice of Wordpress, what would you go with in its place? I argue that whatever it is, it would work much like Wordpress, which has a 20+ year head start, is stable, scales, is widely supported, and open source, so if you don't like the company behind it, you can choose not to use their distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With WordLand we are testing the water hopefully proving that it is possible to create a functional writing environment on the WordPress foundation. Why is that such an advantage? Because, like the word processing products of the 80s on various OSes, these apps should be able to share data. One day you may feel like writing something with WordLand and a few days later you might want to try editing the same document using a different editing tool. As long as they both ingest and emit Markdown, they should have no trouble editing each others' documents. This is where the benefit of a common platform becomes insurmountable, because the silos insist you use their editor and only their editor and an open platform with open data formats lets you move between apps that interop. There’s a reason so many word processors thrived in the 80s, because the needs and tastes of writers vary so much, and technically it was possible to move data around in an ad hoc way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until WordLand, tools for writers on the Wordpress platform were practically nonexistent. I think that can change now, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt; that connects WordLand to Wordpress is both easy to understand, for developers, and open source under the most liberal license. Any app that connects with Wordpress through this API will interop with WordLand so totally that it could replace WordLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would be happy if WordLand played the role of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt; in the Mac ecosystem of the 80s. At the outset it was the only writing tool for the Mac, and set the usability pattern for all that followed. As a result the Mac platform, even though initially its appeal was mainly to developers and designers, quickly boomed as a writer's platform. I strongly believe Wordpress has this potential. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think writers need the same variety and open possibilities as developers, and the existing writer's systems are not offering that choice. I believe this is the start of the writers web, that should, if we do it right, and if my intuition is correct, grow like the web itself at inception. My bet is that an expansive approach will yield far more creativity in a very important area, writing, and should quickly become the place writers want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Rachel Maddow's show these days often begins with a hard-to-watch over-the-top endorsement of Bluesky. She shouldn't be doing that. It's a private company and someday she may criticize them as strongly as she did Facebook. I'd love to hear her explain exactly what's the difference between Bluesky and Facebook. A lot less than you might think.</description>

Anyway, the answer is yes, OPML is the native file format of &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It's the reason we chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; as the format for RSS reading lists, so we could edit them in a distant &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217&quot;&gt;ancestor&lt;/a&gt; of Drummer's whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to change file formats gratuitously -- it's how you can use different tools to edit your own data. That's a big part of the plan with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, because the internal file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it's going to be a perfect basis for interop. Learning from past experience and doing it better each time.</description>

			<description>I wonder when ChatGPT or Claude.ai will compete with Wikipedia. I think Wikipedia is great but it has always had a weakness in that it can be manipulated to tell a story from a very limited point of view. For example the RSS page has a long section explaining the benefits of Atom. What I like about the AI versions of the basic history of things is that it isn't so easily manipulated. I talked about this with Claude, and asked it to write up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/claudewiki/&quot;&gt;proposal for ClaudeWiki&lt;/a&gt;, a Wikipedia workalike, not too expensive to run, make it part of a user's $20 per month subscription. I think it would be useful, if only as a demo how Wikipedia itself might improve its service.</description>

			<description>If I were designing a social network, I would implement replies differently. When you reply to a post, only the person who wrote the post sees it. If they want they can RT it. The way it works now on all twitter-like systems means most of the replies are basically spam, people using your post as a way to reach people who follow you.</description>

			<description>I like people who stand up and speak the truth. This is one of the silver linings of this crisis. There's no real advantage at this point in trying to play it safe, to not be noticed. So I like what Chris Murphy, Senator from Connecticut has been saying.</description>

			<description>I used to tell friends you can't go wrong buying the S&amp;P 500. The president is rated by now the stock market does, and so over the long haul you can expect steady growth from the S&amp;P 500, and it keeps things really simple. Well, have to say -- that's no longer good advice. Maybe real estate? Outside the United States? I don't know. It depends on what the people of this country do, and if our representatives are listening.</description>

Basically, by trying to be the universe, Bluesky is cutting off easy connections that can be made with other networks, make the system work better for communication, and at least deliver &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of the freedom we all want. They've been very successful, and deserve to profit from that, but recognize it plays a larger role today than just as a business, so let's spread it out so it's harder to shut it down. This is a real concern, not just a nice-to-have thing.</description>

			<description>One thing led to another, we discussed lots of facets to the RFSM document. At some point it started rewriting what I had, and used two terms that don't belong in standards-making: dogfood and deprecate. Nothing ever is deprecated. That's arrogance on the part of developers. Imagine if someone in charge of NYC decided to deprecate the arrangement of the streets. Also, if your protocol achieved any adoption at all, there are far more developers than there are originators of the format. If I decided, for example, that the &quot;webmaster&quot; element in RSS was deprecated, do you think anyone would care? Of course not, nor should they. It's a powerless thing. I feel you should introduce features carefully because you will have to live with them forever. Also I thought there was a section in RFSM about breakage. That was Rule #1 at UserLand. We didn't always live up to it. About dogfood:  I don't eat dog food, I'm a human. 2. It says we think of our users as pets, that's not rational or productive. However I do very strongly believe you have to use what you create, because you won't understand what users say unless you are one yourself.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;They're still &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing&quot;&gt;sanewashing&lt;/a&gt; Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Example. Just listened to Brian Lehrer, a news interview and call-in show on WNYC, which I revere, for many reasons. Lehrer is smart, and doesn't dumb things down for his audience. He usually asks the question I'm dying to hear the answer to, which most reporters don't think of or won't ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the March 27 they had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/bl-daily-politics-podcast/articles/columbia-university-faces-the-prisoners-dilemma&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about Trump's assault on Columbia University, which has now been extended to Harvard and Princeton. In all of them, the main issue is antisemitism at these universities.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Never in the discussion did they raise this question --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do we believe that Trump cares about antisemitism?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if he did, there are much bigger antisemites who are much more powerful and much closer to Trump (who is an obvious antisemite himself).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll mention just one -- Elon Musk, who actually did the Nazi salute, twice, from the podium with the Presidential Seal on it, at the freaking inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk has also backed the German Nazi party (they have a different name but to use that name would be NaziWashing, which I won't do).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Occam's truth is that he's tying antisemitism to things because it's fun for him, and because later -- they will blame Jews for everything that's wrong in the US, as they always do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The whole thing of Trump being a champion for Jewish people made me really uneasy, until I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyder.substack.com/p/antisemitism-and-antisemitism&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in Timothy Snyder's newsletter, which I recommend to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I trust Brian Lehrer, I don't think he'd shirk a tough question, I just think as a journalist he still isn't thinking realistically about the world as it is now, instead behaving as he did before it got so rotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I'd like you to insert the person in the profile into the drawing, and adapt it as you see fit, but the face of the person in the profile should be in the same style as the ones around it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave it a snapshot of the art from the season finale of Severance, and my profile picture from Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/01/daveSevChatGPT.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;I laughed out loud as this was revealed by ChatGPT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
