			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/10/kittyStamp.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I wrote a few blog posts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; this morning because it was convenient. It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; and edited a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;complete blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a response to something &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman wrote&lt;/a&gt;, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso&quot;&gt;Marge said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Fargo. &quot;There's more to life than a little money, you know.&quot; It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper&quot;&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.</description>
