It's much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn't what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds you're trying to change, and know you're in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: &quot;With electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering, innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in every journey.&quot; These people understand their product and how their fans see them.</description>

Panel one should show Bull Mancuso, a waste management consultant in New Jersey, at a Starbuck's in Newark, ordering a huge coffee drink. In panel two he's teaching a class on organized crime in New Jersey at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csi.cuny.edu/&quot;&gt;Staten Island Community College&lt;/a&gt;. In panel three he slips on a banana peel on the steps of the Capitol and falls down.

Two heads are better than one in things like this. I think Automattic may be the place to get together on this. Esp since they are the market leader now in this area. What they do, right off the bat, has to be supported everywhere, so we want them to do a good job. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they're always there, and not too busy to help out. They know everything you don't know and need to know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a human btw). It's remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human programming partner. It's the kind of helper I aspire to be.</description>

So if you have an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource.

I am a paying user, I don't want to do any more than I'm currently doing with it. I just want to be able to keep an archive of everything I do, in a format that's more useful to me.

			<description>It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to exist.

			<description>I've been listening to the Grateful Dead today. Today my most favorite Dead song is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmMjY6tXaEo&quot;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;. I love the bass beat, and the simple lyric. A wonderful sing-along. Let there be songs to fill the air. A song about singing. Love it.</description>

			<title>My night at the Dean campaign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd love to tell you a story about the time I had the authority to post to the Dean campaign home page, and they deleted a post I wrote on the night of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0&quot;&gt;Dean Scream&lt;/a&gt; that might have saved the campaign. They were trying to make the story go away. As we know the story didn't go away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/22/iWasAtDeanHqTheNightTheyDi.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The campaign had video that showed clearly that the press was actively trying to kill his candidacy. They had a website, and they had enough money to pay for the bandwidth to run it. They knew what the press was trying to do. They could have fought it. But they didn't.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/12/15/deanForAmericaBumperSticker.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;That night I became friends with Nicco Mele, he was the webmaster at Dean who &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/28/itsAWrap.html#remindsMeOfAStory&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; me the power. I was in their Burlington headquarters at the moment the whole thing imploded, the night of the Iowa caucus. I've also become friends with Joe Trippi, the campaign manager for Dean in 2008. They probably accelerated the adoption of online media in American politics by a decade or more. However, a lot of the ideas from that time are gone, but hopefully not forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest idea was that it gave people a sense of belonging, that they weren't powerless to influence or even control the US government. We all felt that the war in Iraq was wrong, Dean gave Americans a way to say that clearly, with their own actions. I think if we want to achieve our destiny in the 2024 election, we need to get some of that into the campaign, or democracy won't prevail.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a story about how Trump makes people feel like they belong in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3U224ud&quot;&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; written by Philip Bump that Joe and Nicco should read if they haven't. This is something Trump gets that the Democrats have forgotten they know. People don't vote on policy, they vote to belong to something they believe might fix things, whatever that means to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I also blogged about my adventure at the Dean campaign headquarters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2004&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2004/01/18.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html#When:9:56:50AM&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;during&lt;/a&gt; the Iowa caucus and the Dean campaign implosion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040407155545/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/2004/01/19#a418&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the blogging room in Burlington the night of the Iowa caucus in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: In February 2004, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; summing up what we learned from Dean. &quot;In a virtual sense, the Internet was looking for a candidate, and Howard Dean fit the bill. He was bloggable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ideas for Reading Lists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; is a list of feeds you can subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author of the list can add or remove feeds. When they do, people who subscribe to the list are subscribed to the new feeds and unsubbed from the ones that leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading lists are not a new topic, I and others have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+reading+lists&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+reading+lists&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; for years. But they've not been used seriously in the past because they weren't widely supported in feed readers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, my latest feed manager, has reading list support built-in. And we're serious about starting new communities of feeds and users with this feature. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a feed reader user, you probably know about using OPML to move your subscriptions from one app to another, or to share lists with friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading lists take it one step further, you can subscribe to a reading list, so you can control one app from another.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say I had a reading list with my favorite podcasts and my podcasting client could subscribe to it. Then when I add a feed to that list on my desktop computer, the podcast client would automatically be subscribed to it. Or if I used two or more podcast clients (say one on Android and one on iOS), I could control both from the same subscription list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It factors out subscribing. Now you can use one app to manage subscriptions and use lots of apps to read them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's cool about this is that it opens up the possibility for lots of viewer apps. A podcast client is a special kind of feed reader. I'm sure others are possible. But first, to make this practical we need to do better with subscriptions. That's what reading lists are for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another idea. Suppose we wanted to put together a big list of great blogs about Major League Baseball (just an example). I might know a few about the Mets, and my friend Scott who lives in Mountain View, CA, would have a bunch about the Giants. We could put together a group of 100 avid baseball fans, and one of us could put out a reading list for all of our feeds merged into one list. It's not so far-fetched, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; can do that today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could see a similar &quot;big blogroll&quot; for the IndieWeb, or for Bluesky developers -- or really anything. We just have to get started, prime the pump, and learn how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt it was really important to get reading lists built into FeedLand in the current release, because now we're in a position, with the improvements in scaling, to act as a organizing node for new activities with feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is another form of federation, it's more ad hoc, and doesn't require very much technical knowledge. If you know how to use a feed reader, and move around OPML files, you can do all of what I describe in this piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>&quot;Overturn an election?&quot;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase that seems wrong to me, I'll work on it until I figure out why it seems wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That said, I don't think Trump tried to &quot;overturn an election.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More accurately, he tried to &quot;overthrow the government.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I say that:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would be overturn. Overturn doesn't convey the illegitimacy of what Trump tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American values. He tried to &quot;overturn&quot; our most sacred ritual, the transfer of power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people. Overthrow is a much better word for what was done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you commit a crime, say for example killing someone, we don't say they tried to illegally use a weapon, that's too technical, we say they're &quot;accused of murder.&quot; We focus on the consequences. There are lots of ways to illegally use a weapon, what matters is the intended result.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all circumstances. It's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;20th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when Joe Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0&quot;&gt;took the oath&lt;/a&gt;, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath, at 12PM exactly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can also look at the government as a continuous thing, the only difference is there is a new person occupying the office of president. Same government, the one defined by the Constitution. Always on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn't follow the Constitution.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

A hairball is something a cat coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before, unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are open to new ideas.</description>

			<description>A puzzle about ChatGPT. How can it get something right that both Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a source, thus propagating its lies and mistakes. I think this negates the idea that they're just scanning the news orgs to get their information. The method obviously is more sophisticated.</description>

He said I was a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;sports writer&lt;/a&gt; and boasted of the current Celtics team (he's from Boston). They're worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting players. They were great before they added &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827&quot;&gt;Kristaps Porzingis&lt;/a&gt;, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He's one of those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year's Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the Warriors or Kings in this year's finals. Anyway, I write sports for people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and front and center. I'm glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even win. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

He said I was a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;sports writer&lt;/a&gt; and boasted of the current Celtics team (he's from Boston). They're worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting players. They were great before they added &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827&quot;&gt;Kristaps Porzingis&lt;/a&gt;, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He's one of those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year's Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the Warriors or Kings in this year's finals. Anyway, I write sports for people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and front and center. I'm glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even win. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 08 Jan 2024 01:22:14 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/09/porzingas.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/01/07.html#a012214"/>

			<description>Speaking of Fargo, at first I thought it was ridiculous to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm&quot;&gt;Jon Hamm&lt;/a&gt; cast as the fascist police chief of a small North Dakota town, but he's a really good actor (of course) and by episode 8, I'm convinced.</description>

It sounds like the problems were introduced when I did a rewrite of the tab code, and it's probably due to some code catching the click before it gets to the tab code. Once found, it's easy to fix. If you're running Brave or using an Android tablet, could you give it a try per Rich's description, see if you can reproduce. Also curious if there are error messages in the JavaScript console. Thanks!</description>

			<title>Random WordPress idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caveat: This very likely already exists. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Random idea for my friends at Automattic. How about a theme for a WordPress site that's good for technical subjects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should have good default styles for code. Handle screen shot images gracefully. Basically a way of using WordPress for documenting the kinds of things we write up on GitHub because their editor is designed to work well for technical stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking out loud. A good test case would be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't look too great after years of no-updates (more than 20 years) and browser slippage? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It started life as a Manila site, transitioned to WordPress, and now I believe it's a static site. At one time it looked good in WordPress. It could totally use the kind of treatment &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt; got, but obviously it's serving a different purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
