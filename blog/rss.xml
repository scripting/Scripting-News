			<title>What became of 1999.io</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: It's gone -- you can't get &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two apps I miss the most. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;1999 was a rewrite&lt;/a&gt; of blogging software from the point of view of both 1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close. When I realized they weren't going to do it, I set out to do it myself, how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn't have their source code, so I built it from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn't use it. I also couldn't use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version of the Mac OS. It's made me think that maybe in a few years or even months you might not be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. Then I thought about how I can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you depend on should go off the air. See the next post, below.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Protecting your FeedLand subscription lists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, you should keep a current backup copy of your subscription list. It's very easy to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;i&gt;My feed list&lt;/i&gt; in the first menu.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the page.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This is the format that all feed reading software understands. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In your browser, choose the &lt;i&gt;Save Page As&lt;/i&gt; command in the File menu (or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along with your other backups.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription list in localStorage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And if the FeedLand server you're using should happen to disappear, if you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you'll at least have a copy in localStorage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you want to see it -- visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console, and enter this line:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you have questions, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you're a blogger, here's something to think about. Whose writing influenced the way you write? Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker&quot;&gt;Russell Baker&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland&quot;&gt;Douglas Coupland&lt;/a&gt; (specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;MicroSerfs&lt;/a&gt;), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software.</description>

			<description>My father taught me how to organize my thinking when I was trying to figure out how something works. And that's basically what I've spent my life on, figuring out how things work. The most interesting and gratifying was understanding things that didn't exist until I pieced their story together.</description>

It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;local TV&lt;/a&gt; with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier&quot;&gt;Walt Clyde Frazier&lt;/a&gt;. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms&quot;&gt;narration&lt;/a&gt; is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/&quot;&gt;Archie Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. I keep wanting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I do not think it means what you think it means,&quot; but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=nba+schedule&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;&quot;&gt;next game&lt;/a&gt;. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?</description>

			<description>When I log on to meta.ai, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/suggestions.png&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; are the suggestions. None of them relate to things I'm thinking about. I haven't been a student or interviewed for a job in decades. But I've been on Facebook for many years, and I had to connect this to my Facebook account to use it, so presumably it knows all that Facebook knows about me, about me. How long before this is customized?</description>

			<description>I'm looking for a quick and easy and ideally free way to upload an MP3 of a podcast and get back a transcript. I have a feeling that a podcast I recorded yesterday will work better as a written document, but I don't have the patience to transcribe it myself. I asked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1785442296466747624&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3krf2vjg3nk2w&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112362620201313010&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C6Zy6uyJRz1&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/32dce589-58c8-498b-85bd-c1f9a2c1b892&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meta.ai/c/6b8ecc0f-2163-4162-aa48-67e32f4260cc&quot;&gt;Meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
