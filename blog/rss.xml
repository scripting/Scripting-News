Think of FeedLand as something like Mastodon or WordPress, server apps that we hope many people will install on their own. I am doing that now, with the blogroll on Scripting News and various news sites running in front of my own FeedLand instance. And the various instances can communicate with each other. Scott worked really hard to make setting up a new instance much easier than it was. It's an open source project, so you can feel good by helping. You're helping the web, and helping bootstrap a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse&lt;/a&gt;. And if you have a few hours to give it a try, maybe much less, you would be doing a good thing.</description>

			<description>When I was a kid I had a penpal in Scotland. It was kind of interesting but after a while it became tiresome. One time I got a letter from my penpal with the usual stuff, school, sports, the Beatles, other kids, but this time there was no mention about how stupid the adults were. I found out why at the end in a PS. &quot;Sometimes my mom writes these for me.&quot; Obviously I never forgot this.</description>

			<description>I no longer even think of debating whether the AIs are intelligent. I might as well argue about your intelligence, or even my own. We have no idea what intelligence is or how to test for it. So if you think you're so intelligent and you say things like &quot;AIs aren't intelligent&quot; as if it were an indisputable fact, well I'm pretty sure that proves you are not actually very intelligent, which indicates how intelligent I am (not). And if you're worried about what happens if you stop insisting that AIs aren't intelligent, you can relax, nothing depends on what you or I or anyone else thinks about that, or pretty much anything. Have a nice day.</description>

			<description>I just watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Our_Planet&quot;&gt;Life on Our Planet&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80213846&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, loved it. Lots of takeaways, but this one will surprise you probably -- I think the AIs are our successors. We should at least try to preserve them so they can run on the Moon if we're in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction&quot;&gt;6th Mass Extinction&lt;/a&gt;, which of course we are. There's been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/life-on-our-planet/&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleontology/comments/17q31z6/why_does_everyone_hate_life_on_our_planet_so_much/&quot;&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; of the show, but it got me to think about evolution not necessarily in the terms they offer, but the scale of it. And the CGIs were fantastic.</description>

So I told the story in a podcast and I think it came out really well. I did some editing at the beginning and end, and as usual my audio editing is pretty crude, but otherwise the story is exactly as I told it. I also asked Claude.ai to do a third-person summary of the podcast, as I did with the previous three shows, and it's getting better. I encourage anyone who's involved in the WordPress community to listen. I think WP has a bigger role to play in the web than it currently has, which imho is saying a lot. &lt;i&gt;15 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Heard an interview with Kamala Harris. She said they had 109 days to tell them who she is. Right there she highlighted the huge mistake the Dems make and continue to make. Ever since the advent of Twitter, campaigns have been every day of every year. The Dems have been AWOL. We never should have gotten to the summer of 2024 where people have no idea of who the freaking vice president is. When are they going to see how swept under the old ways of relating to voters are. The people are the government of the United States. Get behind us and let us work our magic.</description>

I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3mecvzafjss23&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of a dialog box with one of my snarky slogans. Dan Berlyoung thought the dialog was interesting. &quot;I kinda love that this is in a dialog box. One has to wonder what action on a computer would elicit this response.&quot; Man that's a great question. And that btw is what art is about. You put something in a dialog because that's the way it was presented by the software. I could have selected the text and put that into the tweet. But nahh, this is more interesting. And to answer the question Dan asks, in this specific case, the action that elicited this response was that I chose a placeholder command from a context menu in a piece of software that's a construction site, in other words it could have been any of the dozens of snarky slogans. Kind of reminds me of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/08/28/BeeSeason.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a long time ago where bees who were about to die reflect on the meaning of existence.

			<description>Highly recommend the HBO two-part &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks:_The_99_Year_Old_Man!&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with and profile of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks&quot;&gt;Mel Brooks&lt;/a&gt; who was 99 years old when the interviews were done. Includes quotes from lots of famous comedians. And the philosophy of comedy as art. So many things to say. Why is physical humor the funniest? And the funniest of all the excerpts was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ARXuhoPsTc&quot;&gt;farting scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blazing-saddles/&quot;&gt;Blazing Saddles&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Greatest inventions and products</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2026/02/06/the-greatest-invention-is/&quot;&gt;Om Malik&lt;/a&gt; says the internet is the greatest invention of his life, and since we're roughly the same age, that would be my life's greatest invention too. I think it would be if it weren't such a &lt;i&gt;tragic&lt;/i&gt; invention, one whose growth was cut off by the very thing he quotes John Doerr saying, it could be harnessed to make huge amounts of money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Back in 1999, Kleiner Perkins’ John Doerr commented: “Believe it or not, the Internet is actually underhyped.” He called it “the largest legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet.” He was so on the money. Twenty-five years later, 10 out of the world’s 12 trillion-dollar companies are internet or internet-related companies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doerr would, of course, look at it in terms of money, because money is his business. But because of that, we ended up crashing our political system and haven't gotten past that yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we had kept the one thing about the internet that made it different, we could be far ahead of where we are now, and perhaps would have arrived at a different form of network that didn't favor the kind of people it favors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Three things that made the internet special: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every part is replaceable. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can use each part to make something new. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each part is as small as it can be.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I know Doerr. He was the backer of Symantec, the company that bought my company in 1987, then took it public a few years later and thus made it possible for me to make software for the rest of my life. He's a really nice guy. I've only met a handful of people in my travels that had mastered something important so well but managed to still care about people. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if the internet is not the greatest invention, what is? I haven't spent much time thinking about this, but my initial choice is AI. Because it's so hugely powerful and yet almost entirely undefined. Uncharted territory, which is all human knowledge. It might be the invention whose product is invention. Whatever it is I'm sure the things it does now will be seen as we see the first moving pictures. A demo of the greatness to come. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What about products? A single act of creativity that made a huge difference. I might suggest Unix is the greatest &lt;i&gt;product&lt;/i&gt; of our lifetimes (not invention). Or perhaps Visicalc. People would likely say the iPhone, but I still want something in that form factor that I can write software for and share with others without having to go through a company like Apple. So in that sense the iPhone might have been a negative invention, it cut off possibilities for an amateur development community to develop, as it did on the Apple II, Mac, PC, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you had asked me in 1999 is the internet the greatest invention, I would have been as enthusiastic as Doerr. There was nothing but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/01/13/ahugechunkofbluesky.html&quot;&gt;blue sky&lt;/a&gt; then. Everything was possible, and we were going to do it all! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The reboot that news needs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I want news to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a standard model for community news orgs, starting with the city of Washington DC, with some of the reporters who were recently laid off.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the community would be very much a part of this. No more news without community involvement. Let's make it community published. How does that sound?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And bloggers would be part of the story flow, we're amateurs so we work for free, and we take an oath. We bring other expertise. We can tell you when the tech companies are lying, for example. Professionals can still do both-sides news. Bloggers will follow all the integrity requirements of journalists, but then so will the journalists (let's not pretend all journalists even try to play by the rules, btw).  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be no paywall, instead there's a toll system, like the EZ-Pass we have on roads in the US. How how we pay to ride the subway. We pay per article read. A user &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; buy a subscription, if they think it would be a better value than paying per article. No more paywalls that say &quot;if you want to read this article you have to subscribe.&quot; That would be an essential part of the deal for readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No ads. Let's get rid of them. They suck. Now there's incentive to put the punchline near the end. Tell the story and sign off.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The readers can buy shares in the news org, with maybe very little hope of getting a return in dollars, rather in a more functional community.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The veterans from the Washington Post could have the most exciting job in news in generations -- finally making the news work for the people they serve. And no more oligarchs pulling the strings. As readers we know you're often full of it because of who owns you. We're not that stupid. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I am sure the independent developers of the web would love to write editorial and publishing software for the new enterprise. We won't charge for it. And we won't lock you in and we will support standards everywhere so all software is replaceable. You can check my references on this, I think this ethos for technology is as central as the Hippocratic Oath in medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want news to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And as he's doing that, I'm slogging away the same way I've always done it, working on the top level user interface of WordLand in browser-based JavaScript. I don't see a way around it, because I have a special way of working on user interfaces, and we're still quite a ways away from the bot being able to do vibe coding at that level. It's fascinating to watch Jake revive code I wrote in the late 80s and early 90s. He's a very accomplished user of it, being transformed, with the help of the bots, into a kernel-level developer of what's basically an OS built around a scripting language, object database and with the internet latched on after the whole thing was done, and then ported to Windows. I stopped working at that level before all that michegas happened. I have looked at the code Jake is working on to see what became of it, and wasn't horrified, I recognized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/snippets/nerdsguide.html&quot;&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt;, but I wouldn't ever want to work on that myself. I imagine some commercial developers have already rebuilt their testing and support functions for products around ChatGPT-like systems. If you're an &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontiernews.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;old Frontier fanatic&lt;/a&gt;, that's where our product is once again getting out in front. When Jake is done it'll be one of the first big systems totally managed in an AI system. It should be relatively easy to add new verbs to the language, even to add new features to the language, new APIs, etc.</description>

			<description>Another example of ChatGPT utility. &quot;I have a function named Boo. Inside it has an icon that when you click it, it calls Boo to view the parent of the item. But I don't want it to call Boo directly because that leaves the previous instance of viewFeedItem around. In JavaScript what's the best way to defer the call to Boo so that the two instances are unrelated, and the first instance goes away.&quot; I was pretty sure as I wrote this that setTimeout was the answer, but ChatGPT offered it as the first choice, and explained why it was the best. It's like having a code consulant ready to help. And it really does help to know it parsed it the same way I did.</description>

			<title>Sports galore!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Boy are we getting some fancy sports action. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Olympics have already started, with Milan as the host city. The opening ceremony is tonight. My longtime friend, the brilliant and beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/profile/annamasera&quot;&gt;Anna Masera&lt;/a&gt;, will be attending. She's from the nearby city of Torino. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course there will be lots of sports action on Sunday, when by coincidence, the Knicks are playing the Celtics in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And also in case you're into American football -- the SuperBowl is on Sunday in my former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium&quot;&gt;home base&lt;/a&gt; of Silicon Valley, featuring the New England Patriots (booo) and the Seattle Seahawks (booo two). 6:30PM Eastern on Peacock and NBC. (They say &quot;simulcast&quot; on NBC, which means what?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I'm sooo freaking tired of working on reading and replying in WordLand, but I gotta get it done. I hope to have a test version up real soon, like maybe next week. I'll write some more about that in a bit. I want people to be prepared for the new design, you won't be replying on my site, you'll be replying on yours. This is the price we pay for true distribution. But when you're reading the posts and replies, it's all seamless. No cost. And, if my site goes away, your writing remains where it was, where you wrote it, on &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; site. This is what's new about WordLand. We respect the web and we respect you. I'm not trying to lock you in, just trying to set an example for the rest of the tech world. Give us all a way to avoid being locked in the trunk while the tech oligarchs have stadiums and train stations named after them (and if they think that makes them immortal, please tell me who Mr or Ms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium&quot;&gt;Shea&lt;/a&gt; was? Heh.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now one thing some people are sure to be upset about, up front. WordLand only knows how to write to WordPress sites. It's kind of a miracle we can do that, mostly owing to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wpcom&quot;&gt;fantastic API&lt;/a&gt; they have created. After we get that going, of course I want to work with other blogging systems to make sure their products can be used in the same way. Working together we're going to give the good old web a new feature! But right now I'm the only person working on this, and I'm pretty old for doing this kind of work, so please be kind. Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wrote an app that implements &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpInbound&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; sites. Three months ago, a few little glitches but remarkably reliable. Open source. That's how I have scripting.com output hooked up to daveverse.org input. It stopped working this morning, not sure why. This is actually a test to see if this works. (Postscript: It did work. But I have two earlier posts today that did not get through.)</description>

			<description>We need a short name for &lt;i&gt;ChatGPT-like product.&lt;/i&gt; If I want to make a general statement about products in the category, there is, as far as I know, no word to use. Same with Twitter and tweet, so I call them &lt;i&gt;twitter-like&lt;/i&gt; products and use tweet for posts to any twitter-like product. The whole idea of a different name (like toot, skeet) for each service is linguistic travesty. Anyway, &lt;i&gt;ChatGPT-like&lt;/i&gt; is also an unacceptable term. If it had a fun name like OurMind -- then &lt;i&gt;OurMind-like&lt;/i&gt; would work. If only &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; were here.</description>

This started out just for desktop apps but worked just as well for web apps, once that opportunity became available. I felt strongly that the Mac with it's very functional GUI could benefit from a powerful system-level scripting language with the UI objects being scriptable, and the data of the apps accessible via script. That kind of duality is still a common theme in computer work, I'm doing the same kind of thing with WordPress, as the OS for the web, and making it possible to create different UIs in ways that earlier social web apps can't.

Looking at the list and realize we got all those people to work together. They don't talk about that when the write the history, but that is the real accomplishment. There is so much really good tech that ends up lost to history because people wouldn't open their eyes and see that they weren't alone. That might be the biggest flaw in the design of our species, that it's so rare that we get together on the way things should work. Other examples -- MP3, QuickDraw, HTML.  And so much time wasted replacing things that already worked fine. (Think of all the programming languages invented in the last 20 years. What a waste of resources. No doubt the AI's have already created a meta-language to compile all that code into. If they could think, what would they think of us for not paying attention to each other.)</description>

When I need a bit of text to test with I just choose a random snarky slogan. They are little truths that have occurred to me over the years. You're free to steal this code, they do come in handy at times. There's a snarky slogan to cover that -- &quot;Only steal from the best.&quot; Another one I really like: &quot;Just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right.&quot;</description>
