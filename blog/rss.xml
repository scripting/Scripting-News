I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; this morning to include very basic getting started stuff, and it now includes a link to a form where you can apply to be a tester. At this time it's limited to people who know how to write a bug report, how to find and read the JavaScript console in a web browser, and take a screen shot that shows clearly what went wrong. This the hardest part of getting a product fit for general use, and I'm too old to try to wrangle workable bug reports from well-intentioned users who basically aren't scientists. This time I'm determined to do this the right way without excess wear and tear on me. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds.

			<description>I'm using the term &quot;RSS-based podcasts&quot; in place of &quot;podcasts&quot; to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other &quot;podcasts,&quot; are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their &quot;podcasts&quot; to RSS and everyone's happy. Like &quot;organic cheeseburgers.&quot; :-)</description>

			<description>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</description>

			<description>Welcome to the last month of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!</description>

			<description>I wasn't clear enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. We're losing the word &quot;podcast&quot; very quickly. It's coming to mean video interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there's no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who will want to impose severe limits. This isn't a casual &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt;, it's &lt;i&gt;urgent.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

And when they want to edit the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasnâ€™t been moving  and if we donâ€™t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get started.</description>

It has a terrible memory for things I tell it to remember, but it remembers all the things it got from reading the web. I thank the friends who make the effort to stay in my life. And most important I thank you, dear blog reader. We got through 30 years of this crazy michegas. I think there may be a couple more innovations to come before we hang em up for good.</description>

			<title>The Kennedy v Nixon template</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Analogously, Trump is Kennedy and Biden/Harris is Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the social web is, in 2024, what TV was in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump has mastered the new medium. To a large extent, he &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; the new medium, and the resulting network formed around him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-did-trump-win-james-carville-has-discovered-an/id1728152109?i=1000678267539&quot;&gt;Carville says&lt;/a&gt; he wants to figure out how to communicate the way Trump did, he can't because our way doesn't work in his universe. We have to create our own. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogously Nixon might have said about TV in 1959 -- how can we get into that? If you have to ask you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; get there. You have to fit like a hand in a glove, like Kennedy or Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next Democratic candidate to win the presidency will have to be a media creator. They must create a medium that's perfectly adapted to the communication interests of the 50 percent of the electorate that voted for Harris and the other 20 percent who would if they just knew who she was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look at the picture of Kennedy and Nixon. Did we elect Kennedy over Nixon because he had better policy? No. We elected him because he has better hair. Because on TV what counts is your hair. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chris+lydon&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; who was a TV news person told me that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/28/kennedyNixon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kennedy and Nixon on the debate stage in 1960.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to win, create an internet farm system. A network with everyone who wants to run for office nationwide on the Democratic ticket. And let's see how they work in the new medium. We get to know them like we knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/11/26/weElectedArchieBunker.html&quot;&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. And let's get some people we get to know who also tend to tell the truth (though they can screw up and we'll forgive them, remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;gotchas&lt;/a&gt; are over).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That value wasn't priced into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/twtr&quot;&gt;TWTR&lt;/a&gt; stock. No one listened. Here's the next installment. The US government acquires Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The &quot;constitution&quot; reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems, they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been &lt;i&gt;cartelized,&lt;/i&gt; which is one step beyond &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/22/214100.html&quot;&gt;enshitified&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Today there are so many twitter-like systems that are useful, people want to cross-post. If I'm writing something I plan to cross-post, and I pass the 300-char limit, but I'm not finished, what to do. These days generally I view 500 as the actual limit, which means when my cross-poster tries to publish to Bluesky it fails.

			<description>The usual mindless block-inducing bullshit from twitter and every other online venue is showing up on Bluesky. I wonder if people understand the economic box that's pushing them into. It's so important that if it's going to be the next Twitter, we as a world, invest in lifeboats to get off the ship quickly and easily if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan&quot;&gt;Hulk Hogan&lt;/a&gt; ends up being the czar of Bluesky. Weirder things are possible my friends.</description>

			<description>If such a network existed, we would be nominating our own Cabinet members, the shadow Cabinet. Let the journalists compare the qualifications of our candidates vs the incumbent party's. Create news. That's what the Dems absolutely suck at. They very quietly pass legislation that the other party (which votes against) takes credit for. One party is on the air, the other is not. We need to change that. We make news. And we listen to each other, not just the stuffed shirts who run the party now.</description>

Bluesky is hot now, but this isn't over yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Developers are deliberately locking their users in by creating new APIs that are not only incompatible with previously existing APIs, but also are difficult for developers who learned earlier APIs to adopt because now they have all kinds of replicated code for different systems. It adds another level of complexity to the developer's code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What each platform vendor wants is not only captive users, but also locked-in developers. Why do you think they all have new languages? Come on is Swift really better than Go or React or whatever. Groups of Mac developers constantly spinning their wheels to keep up with Apple breaking releases. Groups of JavaScript developers. And there are many &lt;i&gt;kinds&lt;/i&gt; of JS devs. When does it end. Ones who build on OpenAI and others that develop on the APIs of other vendors (I'm not even trying to go on that ride, too late in my career.) There's so much confusion, that leads to exhaustion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we're feeling it especially hard when there are such ill-conceived duplicate APIs that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; could have been done with RSS 2.0 and OPML.  Every one of them. Cory Doctorow, who came up with the term enshitification, also wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise&quot;&gt;passionate piece about RSS&lt;/a&gt;. I want to say to my friend Cory, if a system isn't built on RSS at this point, they are certainly trying to lock users and developers in. I don't care if it's ActivityPub or ATProto or Facebook or Meta or X or Twitter (sorry I can't keep up with their names). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to build on a system that's pure inbound and outbound RSS. Give me lists in OPML and the please just let me ignore the rest of your lockin strategy. They talk a good line about wanting interop, federation and standards, but their actions speak otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At a conference the CEO of twitter-splitter Bluesky said her product is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html&quot;&gt;billionaire-proof&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't seem too likely to me that it is. And maybe they're quoting her incorrectly. A billionaire could take it over and the users would have no recourse, the whole thing would blow up even more quickly than Twitter is (and I'm not convinced it has blown up, there still seems to be a lot going on there, I think perhaps people are exaggerating how polluted it is or maybe I'm being shielded by an algorithm). It would be nice to use a system that is truly billionaire-proof. How about building a network on top of something else that is 100 percent RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, RSS is probably the closest to billionaire-proof. I don't get royalties on it, lots of people have tried to make big bucks from it, but so far its only allegiance is to people who want to publish and receive news. If a billionaire could buy it, they probably would have by now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Of course they didn't know her. That's because the Dems go off the air &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1854036662952620232&quot;&gt;on Election Day&lt;/a&gt; and don't show up again for three years. Meanwhile the other party is on the air 24 hours a day, every day of every year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next time we nominate a candidate, the voters will already know them and like them. No more of the &quot;we don't know her well enough.&quot; That's what mattered. They want a sense that they know who you are. The same way kids of my generation knew who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker&quot;&gt;Archie Bunker&lt;/a&gt; was, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maude_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Maude&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore&quot;&gt;Mary Tyler Moore&lt;/a&gt;. That's where trust comes from. We may not have liked Archie Bunker's politics, but we knew who he was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time so when we choose a candidate the people will already know and like them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-setback-for-trump-as-gopers-privately-tell-him/id1728152109?i=1000677605316&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; where Greg Sargent and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-cabinet-team-of-outlaws-gaetz-hegseth-gabbard-rfk&quot;&gt;guest&lt;/a&gt; kept saying &quot;we gotta figure this out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/27/successionPoster.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The answer is staring you in the face.

The leaders of the new Democratic Party will be comfortable in their own skin. They tell you what they think. Fetterman, AOC, Tammy Baldwin. There will be many of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying. When you say nothing people think you agree with them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's get the Dems back on the air before the inauguration.

			<description>What matters with social networks is what you can get done there, not so much the features of the network. Bluesky has the same features today it had a month ago. The difference is we had an election in the US, I guess that was the catalyst. The presence of Elon Musk so close to Trump says there is a need for a Musk-free place. I've kept my account on Twitter. I started there in 2006, and I love the web more than I feel it would do any good to erase my presence there. It's pretty much against my religion to deliberately erase bits of the web. And whatever you think of Twitter, it is most definitely part of the web.</description>

			<title>Bluesky feature request</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky devs.. How about a compromise. Support inbound RSS. Let me enter the URL of an RSS feed in settings. I'll ping a fixed location when the feed updates. Would allow the same flow to go to other systems. This would help a lot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Imagine a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any blogging tool that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that could be created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.) &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood basis for interop. It's a brilliant competitive move, if they really intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their competitors to follow suit. I don't doubt that Mastodon would do it. And Threads might even do it if they're feeling competitive with Bluesky. They've already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that's been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should take a small fraction of the time to adapt.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn't be tremendously surprised if they actually did it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up." created="Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:27:56 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/18/142716.html#a142756"/>
					<source:outline text="It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.)" created="Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:33:59 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/18/142716.html#a143359"/>
					<source:outline text="Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood basis for interop. It's a brilliant competitive move, if they really intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their competitors to follow suit. I don't doubt that Mastodon would do it. And Threads might even do it if they're feeling competitive with Bluesky. They've already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that's been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should take a small fraction of the time to adapt." created="Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:28:47 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/18/142716.html#a142847"/>
					<source:outline text="Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of users." created="Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:30:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/18/142716.html#a143043"/>
					<source:outline text="The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn't be tremendously surprised if they actually did it." created="Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:31:14 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/18/142716.html#a143114"/>

			<title>Feedback on sez.us sign up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why I haven't created an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sez.us/&quot;&gt;sez.us&lt;/a&gt; yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info later, after I've created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to the next screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then they ask for my phone number. That's when I hit the back button. I already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren't good there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don't mind providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up front.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also I don't like white on black letters. It's hard for me to read. All the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an option if it's important to you, but please default to black on white.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer asked&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.</description>

If it's bought by someone who wants to use it the way Musk has, they can, without any recourse by the users. As they said in the old days, if you're getting something for free, you're the product, not the customer. We helped Musk build a way to excercise political power against our interests. You may think Bluesky is a way of fixing that, but it probably isn't. They're digging a deep hole, probably too deep to climb out of at this point. They did some innovative stuff, perhaps. But they ended up at the same place, it appears, as Twitter did.</description>
