We need someone to do a canvas of how intellectuals use ChatGPT-like systems to advance their research and creativity, or just for learning or fun. It's the same kind of opportunity that was in front of us in 2003 when blogs were new, and only a few people loved the idea, but they were fierce in their enthusiasm. You could tell something was happening. It happened before that with PCs, and now it's happening again with AI. I'm absolutely sure of this, as sure as I was with PCs and the web. So Chris, humor me -- this is your new assignment -- find out from the people who listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; not what's bad about AI, they hear that all the time, let's hear their stories, why they think it's the best thing ever. I believe you'll find them. That's what's missing today in journalism, and it's something Chris is uniquely able to do. BTW, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=ChatGPT&quot;&gt;list of things&lt;/a&gt; I've written recently about ChatGPT.</description>

The level of hypocrisy is intense. Who covered up what? Please. I remember Hillary's Emails. And weapons of mass destruction. And Trump may not be good for America but he's sure good for CBS. And on and on. They think we don't think. But their influence is getting close to nil. American news is one story at a time, debates between boring people saying the same bullshit over and over. Democrats who stumble over their words. An occasional glypse of Bernie or AOC. Something to get your bile up, and the next one and the one after that, but it doesn't work anymore. What Biden did or didn't do is no more relevant on CNN than it is on Fox.</description>

What's nice is that the results are focused on the early 2000s, when the standards we use now were coming up. We can do this kind of stuff again. There's more to do. For example, it would be really cool if &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt;, their excellent podcast client, would let users publish their subscription list so we can build applications on them. There's a whole new base of data to work with. And unlike other media, podcast content is meant to be shared. The controversies that exist for professional writing and audiobooks, for example, don't apply to podcasts. If we could open this up, we could create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcasting/#1733322866000&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; worth of applications very quickly. OPML is an easy format to get into a database. We just need sources of interesting data.</description>

I just did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=mullenweg&quot;&gt;search for Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, and came up with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2006/04/feed-validator/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Matt in 2006 about the Feed Validator. The clarity is remarkable, and he's of course right. The people running the validator were actually promoting Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal was &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open web. When you keep changing your mind about what to flag and what to pass you end up with a standard that's as murky as the tariff policy of the US in 2025. I think you have to assume that was the goal. They didn't like that RSS didn't fall apart when Atom came out. If there's no benefit in changing, people don't.</description>

			<description>I've been working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=daytona&quot;&gt;search function&lt;/a&gt; for this blog, and now we have all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=davenet&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt; pieces between 1994 and 2004 in the database. &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=autoweb&quot;&gt;Autoweb&lt;/a&gt; was my first static site generator. Here's a search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22&quot;&gt;menu sharing&lt;/a&gt; which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.</description>

			<description>And with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database&quot;&gt;this update&lt;/a&gt;, we don't depend on OPML any longer to create the database, all the data is exported in a format that can be easily imported directly into an SQL database.

			<description>Apparently Chrome has changed the behavior of images served over http in web pages. It's changing the request to https, so it gives an erroneous error message about the certificate which the page never claimed to have.</description>

But Chrome wouldn't stay out of the way, so had to give up. Hey I was trying to route around their outage.</description>

They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say &quot;no one did anything first&quot; (paraphrasing) and that's basically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html&quot;&gt;same idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I don't doubt that the next big media invention, the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the people developing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This appeared earlier as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E&quot;&gt;grabbing&lt;/a&gt; Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Look at this, for an idea of what a product says to the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes you laugh. When you laugh inside an idea forms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ain't it the truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That gets you ready to read the pitch, which is stuff you wouldn't have read or even considered if they hadn't said something so true right up front.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/17/uglyAd.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ugly is only skin-deep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what's wrong with the opposition political party in the US, they think all they need to do is recite the facts. But first you have to convince them you speak from the heart, you'll tell the truth, even if it hurts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's an ugly car. Yeah, but you'll come to love how ugly it is because it's so beautiful inside. What you say next hardly matters, because they already believe that you speak the truth. And that's when they're ready to sign on the dotted line.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what the Republicans do so well, before and after Trump, that the Democrats don't even gets exists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out what the Dems need, the top guy has to be an entrepreneur.

And as long as I can get a good selection of interesting stuff to listen to on my phone, there's no reason look elsewhere.

It was a way of earning points from the people who ran Twitter and tech conferences like SXSW, basically asshole-like people who wanted to close the door on the open web. And now here we are 2.5 decades later and people are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; doing it. You should self-censor on that one, those people are long-gone, probably doing stuff with crypto or nuzzling up to oligarchs, and you're keeping their asshole-ness alive.

			<description>I wanted to design a Google Form, and thought to ask ChatGPT for instructions from a spec I wrote. Then I thought to ask Gemini, which is Google's chatbot, wondering if they would just do the work for me instead of providing instructions. I would have laughed out loud if they did, but alas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/add0560b6b02&quot;&gt;just instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually they will do that for you.</description>

			<title>About the Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanson has been working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/&quot;&gt;Baseline theme&lt;/a&gt; and it's ready for people to try out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme for WordLand-authored WordPress sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site running in WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the features you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Scott has said he'd be happy to work with others to make it so that it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As the developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way blogs implement various features in 2025. It's been a long time since we took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used, especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging predates both. So of course the &lt;i&gt;presentation&lt;/i&gt; of the blog has opportunities to evolve as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line -- if you already have a WordPress theme you're happy with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you're starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I have it installed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse.org&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm a happy camper. So we have one endorsement. It's a good start. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have comments or questions, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/88&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; to post them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me think I must be dreaming. &lt;i&gt;NYK leads 3-1.&lt;/i&gt; Yesterday at this time (5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and the beginning of last night's game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks couldn't seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It's primitive, but it's real. However! In the second half it turned around. The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by &lt;i&gt;being better&lt;/i&gt; than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must've relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we're up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one, it's over. No I didn't think we'd be here tonight. Remember that when you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as unbelievable as that might be.</description>

I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda. I know I'm watching the Knicks tonight, with a certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html?title=theKnicksAndTheEpicFart&quot;&gt;dread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda. I know I'm watching the Knicks tonight, with a certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html?title=theKnicksAndTheEpicFart&quot;&gt;dread&lt;/a&gt;." created="Mon, 12 May 2025 12:10:35 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/12/peakyBlinders.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/05/12.html#a121035"/>

			<description>So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.</description>

			<title>What do I really own?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree &quot;I own you.&quot; The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. &quot;I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die.&quot; I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership. But it sure did put things in perspective!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/11/ownership.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;I thought of the tree, &quot;I own you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote that paragraph in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html#p9324&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Software isn't a thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When a friend discovers a new product of mine and says the world owes Dave for being such a great guy, I wish they'd skip that part, and follow what we're doing. Get in the loop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Software isn't a thing, it isn't finished, it's a process as it gets invented by the users. It's a performing art. WordLand today is like a musician performing in a small club, working out the playlist, and hoping to be playing at theaters then arenas, and finally someday, if we're very good, stadiums. But we need help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you love WordLand, subscribe. Use the software. Learn what it can do, hit its limits, make requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember very well being handed a list of feature requests by Apple's lead evangelist from a new exec they just hired at Apple. I looked at the list, and handed it back and said I'd like to meet him. On the paper was the top ten list of &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; MORE user at the time. We knew what they wanted because we listened, studied, and learned. I knew his new boss was a real user, and thus I knew we could do stuff together. It worked out exactly that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you love it, use it, &lt;i&gt;become part of it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've written about this over the years with the motto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+shitty+software&quot;&gt;we make shitty software&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>America as a platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We lived for the first years of my life in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights&quot;&gt;Jackson Heights&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably, today, the most culturally diverse place in the world. In the 1960s it was a white neighborhood that was adjacent to a black neighborhood, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;. They paired our elementary schools when I was in third or fourth grade. My little brother went to the school in Corona, and I stayed in the school in Jackson Heights. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/05/10/eveWinerPeterWinerWalkToSchool.png&quot;&gt;famous picture&lt;/a&gt;, in our family at least, of my mother walking my brother to school. It was on the front page of the NYT one day. That was a big deal then.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was in fifth grade we moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;. It was a sleepy little place (for NYC), nice houses, mostly Irish and Italian families with a few Jews. Now it's a Far East culture, from China and Korea, and still just as nice as it ever was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have a system in this country, it takes people from everywhere and gives them a platform to create whatever they want. In Flushing it's the best Chinese food in the city, which is saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My programmer friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been writing the colorful saga of my sad depressed programmer friend on Facebook, and it was getting some interest from friends until I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308&quot;&gt;moved it into a group&lt;/a&gt; and now no one reads it, which makes me sad and depressed too because the story of my programmer friend took an interesting turn after he maxed out on space, got a call from the NBA commisioner asking if he would mind officiating the Knicks two playoff games in Boston this last week. My friend, was of course quite sad and depressed, but he was also exhausted and bored, so he said yes. Here he is before the first of two games, which partially thanks to his officiating were near-blowouts for the Celtics, and thus the Knicks are up 2-0 heading into tomorrow's game in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/sadFriendInBostonKnicksWinHaha.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Friend sadly officiating at the TD Garden in Boston.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The latest Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say the latest &lt;i&gt;Baseline&lt;/i&gt; theme looks great!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I just wrote, in the WordLand editor, and the writing experience was excellent. It took a long time and a lot of work to get it there, but it is there now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as the post says, it's not just a blog post, it's also a tweet. And it's not a miracle, it's just endless iteration over both sides, the reading and writing, until it felt right. So far all that's visible is the writing side. But I know something about reading too, having written a number of feed readers over the years, including the first one. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Scott Hanson on one side of this effort and me on the other, him the developer, me the user (ie writer of blog posts and tweets) -- we wrestled with WordPress themes. I wanted a minimal design, a place to start -- which is why the theme is called Baseline. It's a Christmas Tree without any ornaments. None. A fresh start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be a release of this theme in a short while. I just wanted to boast a bit about what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/baselineExample.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the post rendered in Baseline theme.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;viewed in the web&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/wordlandEditor.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the post being edited in WordLand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I cut it back to work exactly like bookmarks in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I have to do a bit more work before it's ready to release, probably tomorrow.</description>
