It was a huge day in my life, and in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I was there that day, along with Kandes Bregman from my startup, Living Videotext. We had a full page ad in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MACWORLD-Macintosh-Magazine-Premier-February/dp/B001OI6YL6&quot;&gt;first issue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/macworld-magazine&quot;&gt;MacWorld&lt;/a&gt;. We were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our &quot;idea processor&quot; ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people at Apple who believed in us, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boich&quot;&gt;Mike Boich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Yocam&quot;&gt;Del Yocam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Campbell_(business_executive)&quot;&gt;Bill Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. I don't know if we would have made it without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn't have to find out. Thank you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software developers.</description>

But I did write a piece on what made the Mac different on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html&quot;&gt;25th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. BTW, the comments on that piece are incredible.

			<description>I re-watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook&quot;&gt;Silver Linings Playbook&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, and this is a pure JL showcase. But the best moment was stolen by Robert DeNiro who is batshit crazy like most of the characters in the movie when he tells his son in two sentences about our purpose on the planet, which of course is to love Jennifer Lawrence. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Why isn't there a karaoke website where I can sing along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dead.net/song/ripple&quot;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt; with the lyrics scrolling by. Could we do it together over the internet? It probably doesn't exist because of Hollywood tightasses. But surely there must be some uncopyrighted music we could try this. Hey I bet it actually exists. Send me a link.</description>

If we all watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy&quot;&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt; and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards&quot;&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt; for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;recent trade&lt;/a&gt; where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career&quot;&gt;Great Hope&lt;/a&gt; of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/&quot;&gt;hotshit kid&lt;/a&gt; with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; was something else. I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel&quot;&gt;Niners and Packers&lt;/a&gt; fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate.</description>

Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238&quot;&gt;recent trade&lt;/a&gt; where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career&quot;&gt;Great Hope&lt;/a&gt; of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/&quot;&gt;hotshit kid&lt;/a&gt; with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; was something else. I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel&quot;&gt;Niners and Packers&lt;/a&gt; fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate." created="Sun, 21 Jan 2024 16:24:25 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/30/quickley.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/01/21.html#a162425"/>

			<title>Bull Mancuso comics bonus!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law. She's a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck's, which she gets from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3818612,-71.1198074,3a,75y,313.45h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss6IPyoxMNQaPkqRfO8TULg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;store on Mass Ave&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus. Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first, because it's closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard Law School &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/classroom.png&quot;&gt;classroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/professorMancuso1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;#1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/20/professorMancuso2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;#2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn't what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds you're trying to change, and know you're in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: &quot;With electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering, innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in every journey.&quot; These people understand their product and how their fans see them.</description>

Panel one should show Bull Mancuso, a waste management consultant in New Jersey, at a Starbuck's in Newark, ordering a huge coffee drink. In panel two he's teaching a class on organized crime in New Jersey at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csi.cuny.edu/&quot;&gt;Staten Island Community College&lt;/a&gt;. In panel three he slips on a banana peel on the steps of the Capitol and falls down. There is no dialogue on any panel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/01/18/bullMancusoDay.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Bull Mancuso's wild day in New Jersey, Staten Island and DC.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they're always there, and not too busy to help out. They know everything you don't know and need to know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a human btw). It's remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human programming partner. It's the kind of helper I aspire to be.</description>

So if you have an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience.

That is sick. Here's what I want. I want to go to a pro-democracy event, where we do things like register to vote, and offer community service to each other. We need to belong to something great, not to study the degradation of our country. We also should use our communication systems to spread not only positive messages, but to position Hitler as the ultimate loser. We have to present the counter-argument, in a way that still has a chance of getting through. And I still want us to celebrate the symbols of our fight for freedom, which obviously never ends. That's why I'm wearing a MLK button, in real life and &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/15/blogscreenshot.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;on my blog&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>It makes sense that AI is coming into existence at the time the human species, and most living things on the planet, appear about to cease to exist. It's possible that we are just building our successor. A sort of ark of intellect. It would make sense, if there is a Creator, that they would arrange things this way. Just-in-time species reboot.</description>

I love the bass beat, and the simple lyric. A wonderful sing-along. Let there be songs to fill the air. A song about singing. Love it.</description>

			<title>My night at the Dean campaign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd love to tell you a story about the time I had the authority to post to the Dean campaign home page, and they deleted a post I wrote on the night of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0&quot;&gt;Dean Scream&lt;/a&gt; that might have saved the campaign. They were trying to make the story go away. As we know the story didn't go away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/22/iWasAtDeanHqTheNightTheyDi.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The campaign had video that showed clearly that the press was actively trying to kill his candidacy. They had a website, and they had enough money to pay for the bandwidth to run it. They knew what the press was trying to do. They could have fought it. But they didn't.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/12/15/deanForAmericaBumperSticker.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;That night I became friends with Nicco Mele, he was the webmaster at Dean who &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/28/itsAWrap.html#remindsMeOfAStory&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; me the power. I was in their Burlington headquarters at the moment the whole thing imploded, the night of the Iowa caucus. I've also become friends with Joe Trippi, the campaign manager for Dean in 2008. They probably accelerated the adoption of online media in American politics by a decade or more. However, a lot of the ideas from that time are gone, but hopefully not forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest idea was that it gave people a sense of belonging, that they weren't powerless to influence or even control the US government. We all felt that the war in Iraq was wrong, Dean gave Americans a way to say that clearly, with their own actions. I think if we want to achieve our destiny in the 2024 election, we need to get some of that into the campaign, or democracy won't prevail.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a story about how Trump makes people feel like they belong in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3U224ud&quot;&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; written by Philip Bump that Joe and Nicco should read if they haven't. This is something Trump gets that the Democrats have forgotten they know. People don't vote on policy, they vote to belong to something they believe might fix things, whatever that means to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I also blogged about my adventure at the Dean campaign headquarters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2004&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2004/01/18.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html#When:9:56:50AM&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;during&lt;/a&gt; the Iowa caucus and the Dean campaign implosion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040407155545/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/2004/01/19#a418&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the blogging room in Burlington the night of the Iowa caucus in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: In February 2004, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; summing up what we learned from Dean. &quot;In a virtual sense, the Internet was looking for a candidate, and Howard Dean fit the bill.

			<title>Ideas for Reading Lists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; is a list of feeds you can subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author of the list can add or remove feeds. When they do, people who subscribe to the list are subscribed to the new feeds and unsubbed from the ones that leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading lists are not a new topic, I and others have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+reading+lists&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+reading+lists&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; for years. But they've not been used seriously in the past because they weren't widely supported in feed readers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, my latest feed manager, has reading list support built-in. And we're serious about starting new communities of feeds and users with this feature. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a feed reader user, you probably know about using OPML to move your subscriptions from one app to another, or to share lists with friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading lists take it one step further, you can subscribe to a reading list, so you can control one app from another.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say I had a reading list with my favorite podcasts and my podcasting client could subscribe to it. Then when I add a feed to that list on my desktop computer, the podcast client would automatically be subscribed to it. Or if I used two or more podcast clients (say one on Android and one on iOS), I could control both from the same subscription list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It factors out subscribing. Now you can use one app to manage subscriptions and use lots of apps to read them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's cool about this is that it opens up the possibility for lots of viewer apps. A podcast client is a special kind of feed reader. I'm sure others are possible. But first, to make this practical we need to do better with subscriptions. That's what reading lists are for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another idea. Suppose we wanted to put together a big list of great blogs about Major League Baseball (just an example). I might know a few about the Mets, and my friend Scott who lives in Mountain View, CA, would have a bunch about the Giants. We could put together a group of 100 avid baseball fans, and one of us could put out a reading list for all of our feeds merged into one list. It's not so far-fetched, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; can do that today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could see a similar &quot;big blogroll&quot; for the IndieWeb, or for Bluesky developers -- or really anything. We just have to get started, prime the pump, and learn how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt it was really important to get reading lists built into FeedLand in the current release, because now we're in a position, with the improvements in scaling, to act as a organizing node for new activities with feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is another form of federation, it's more ad hoc, and doesn't require very much technical knowledge. If you know how to use a feed reader, and move around OPML files, you can do all of what I describe in this piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We're supposed to leave a good trail behind us, but I've only managed to do that in certain ways. For example, I have standardized on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/worknotes.md&quot;&gt;worknotes.md&lt;/a&gt; file for each of my projects and I'm pretty good about updating it. I also publish the OPML source of my code, which contains a lot more in the way of internal docs than the JavaScript files I publish alongside them, simply because the outline format lends itself to inline docs, and I have been doing that systematically for at least thirty years. And I now include the OPML source in most projects in a file called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/source.opml&quot;&gt;source.opml&lt;/a&gt;. There's a big comment at the top of each of the files at the top that explains. If you're interested, work backward through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/a&gt; of my repos.</description>

			<title>&quot;Overturn an election?&quot;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase that seems wrong to me, I'll work on it until I figure out why it seems wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That said, I don't think Trump tried to &quot;overturn an election.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More accurately, he tried to &quot;overthrow the government.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I say that:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would be overturn. Overturn doesn't convey the illegitimacy of what Trump tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American values. He tried to &quot;overturn&quot; our most sacred ritual, the transfer of power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people. Overthrow is a much better word for what was done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you commit a crime, say for example killing someone, we don't say they tried to illegally use a weapon, that's too technical, we say they're &quot;accused of murder.&quot; We focus on the consequences. There are lots of ways to illegally use a weapon, what matters is the intended result.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all circumstances. It's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;20th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when Joe Biden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0&quot;&gt;took the oath&lt;/a&gt;, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath, at 12PM exactly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can also look at the government as a continuous thing, the only difference is there is a new person occupying the office of president. Same government, the one defined by the Constitution. Always on. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn't follow the Constitution.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I first heard this term in speeches given by a tech exec, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy&quot;&gt;Scott McNealy&lt;/a&gt;, talking about a competitor's product. A hairball is something a cat coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before, unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are open to new ideas.</description>

			<description>I asked &quot;Is news copyrightable&quot; on various social web sites because people aren't making a distinction between the expression and the underlying facts of news. If an AI bot reads a news article, and extracts the facts, then there's no problem, because no one owns the facts.</description>
