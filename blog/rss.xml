We don't study this like we do economic depression, but we should, because otherwise how will we get out of it? We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_D._Snyder&quot;&gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt; tell us how to recognize fascism, authoritarianism, totalitarianism and all the other terrible human behavior that are on the rise. Let's also study how cultures emerged from these periods, if possible, without total destruction. Today total destruction might not be survivable on a species level. I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/08/politicalDepressionScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;skipped over this&lt;/a&gt; the other day when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/06.html#a002424&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; the term for the first time. It just occurred to me that one way to emerge from it before it's too late is if a few Congressional Republicans took the Dems up on their offer to collaborate on choosing the next Speaker. Because enough come from majority Democratic districts, it might just get them re-elected next year. If they go the other way and support a Republican that's catering to the eight insane House members, the depression will continue unabated for more months or years. When you see an opening, first you have to actually see it.</description>

			<description>Interesting perspective shift. I saw there's a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.bcs.org/store/221/detail/workgroup?id=3-221-9781780176413&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pesce&quot;&gt;Mark Pesce&lt;/a&gt; about AI systems, and it gets pretty technical. I was surprised because I thought he was a pundit (which he is) but unlike most tech pundits, he also knows how to program. More than that. I remember the first time I had a real talk with a famous tech pundit in the 80s and was shocked that he knew nothing about the ones and zeros. Didn't these people at least take &lt;a href=&quot;https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science&quot;&gt;Intro to Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; in college? Shouldn't that be a basic prerequesite for selling one's opinions about tech? Now many years later I'm surprised to see one that does.</description>

			<description>One thing I remember correctly is this -- if, someday, I wasn't able to pay my AWS and Digital Ocean bills, this site and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;everything else&lt;/a&gt; I've got running on the web would probably disappear within 30 days. That's never been an acceptable situation to me. I've been conscious of the fragility of the web since almost the beginning. I hope to have this solved by this time next year on the 30th anniversary. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>At the same time, I've been programming for &lt;i&gt;fifty years&lt;/i&gt; as of this year. I started programming at 18 as a student at Tulane University. A math major who decided to give computers a try because &quot;I heard you can make money doing that.&quot; Fifty years might be some kind of record too. All through my career, going back to my mid-30s, people have written me off as too old to develop software. I always resisted this, and resented people playing that trick. It wasn't true in my 30s or 40s or 50s, or even 60s, but I can see a day when it will be true. Programming depends on human memory. Over time the machine you're building on becomes more complex, the interconnections between the components become harder to grok, and you often don't remember why you did this or that. You resist making changes that could bring the whole thing down. So evolution of software becomes slower. There is a reason you can't keep pitching in baseball, or being a basketball star after 40. In software the time barrier is higher, but it is there, I can feel it.</description>

			<description>I was talking with some friends the other day about what a project to restore the early blogosphere might be like. Off the top of my head I thought of several sites I'd want to be sure were restored in their original condition and location. First, Jorn Barger's Robot Wisdom, Evan Williams' Evhead and Justin Hall's Links.net. I'd also go for Blogtree, which was an innovative and fascinating effort to create basically a family tree of early blogs. I'd approach it like an archeologist. Some of the originals aren't with us any longer, some that never got the notoriety that they deserved imho, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle&quot;&gt;Jerry Pournelle&lt;/a&gt;, who greatly influenced me as an observer of tech. I'd love to see the earliest posts on Mike Arrington's TechCrunch, another important blog that had enormous influence. Doc Searls, the Cluetrain, Kottke, Meghead, I know there are whole universes of blogging that I don't know anything about, it grew so large so quickly. And it was very gratifying to see the Harvard blogs mostly restored. There was a lot of stuff that didn't make the first cut. But it set me thinking about what we could do if we really worked at it and what that might mean for creating more persistent writing on the web for the present and future.</description>

			<description>Journalism could do some good by focusing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/45qulMJ&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; the House Dems are making to possibly persuadable Repubs. Treat it seriously. Ask Repubs what they think. I think there's still some amount of honor, if not in the representatives, in the people. With press air cover, people could call their reps, write op-eds and blog posts, picket, collect signatures. Protest. It's a good thing to discuss. When and if the political depression in America lifts, this is what what it will look like.</description>

It's very easy to support in a CMS, so people tend to do it. My site has the feature.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a confusing story going around that Twitter was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/x-accessibility-concerns-over-removed-headlines&quot;&gt;limiting&lt;/a&gt; this feature, or even ignoring it. It wasn't clear from the story exactly what they were doing, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1710458267468546276&quot;&gt;let's find out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've added an image and description to this post. Did they come through when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1710458267468546276&quot;&gt;pointed to it&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where are you reading the post? A mobile device, desktop, some other place? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ignore this if you got it via email, this feature doesn't apply there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/06/whatThePostLookedLikeOnTwitter.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;: When I read the post in Chrome on my desktop Mac, the title and description were not shown, the image was shown, and the name of the site was shown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can post a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/275&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I'm surprised one of the music companies doesn't buy Peloton which I hear is struggling. I'm always looking for music with a strong steady beat. For the beginning of the workout I go with songs that are steady but relatively slow, to warm up to -- like Eric Clapton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYS732zyYfU&amp;t=76s&quot;&gt;Cocaine&lt;/a&gt;. It's perfect. But as I rev up I go for music with a faster strong steady beat. For that nothing like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Costello&quot;&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt;. For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y71iDvCYXA&quot;&gt;Pump It Up&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;i&gt;sooo&lt;/i&gt; perfect for Peloton. Oh my god. I'm listening to it now, and I'm moving, even though I just started work for the day. Really gets you going. If you don't believe me try playing it &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Elvis-costello-pump-it-up-lyrics&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven sent.

			<title>Twitter never did links anyway</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/04/debbieDowner.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Today's debate is whether Elon Musk is out to strangle journalism by algorithmically downplaying links somehow. But that isn't what he said. What he actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; is that in Twitter people don't click on links. This is observable. I've known this for years as I tried to arrange it so people could read my blog posts where ever they wanted, and finally in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;gave up&lt;/a&gt; because it was impossible. Even if Twitter had completely dropped the character limit then, it still wouldn't have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why don't people click on links? Probably because the user experience is a nightmare. First you have to turn off your add blocker to even see the article, and then you have to subscribe to the pub to read this one article. So you hit the back button and if you're like me you remember never again to click on links in Twitter. That happened long before Musk arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also what Twitter does is not linking because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can't hot-up some text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can only link to one thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a very limited form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/4818e375-949d-4b7e-9686-4961f148ee32&quot;&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. But not like I do linking in a story like the one you're reading now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best thing one of these services could do to distinguish itself is to support Markdown, allow enclosures for podcasting, have outbound RSS feeds to start, and inbound feeds soon after, and optional titles. That's about it. Basic features of blogging software circa 1999 or so. But they don't want to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one that did so would be loved by writers, and if writers love it, it can't be long before readers love it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the feature that Twitter added in February, while it isn't the panacea that would allow Twitter to let me post my writing there, it is a big step forward. 4000 characters is a pretty useful possible length. And they did exactly what I said they should a decade or so ago with what I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;Fat Tweets&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't want to read the rest, after 280, don't click the freaking button. But when you do, you'll know:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No delay, the text is already there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No request to turn off ad blockers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No paywall.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sounds a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;like podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, you know Adam's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/the-last-yard-adam-curry&quot;&gt;Last Yard&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words you will be able to read what's there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a start. It's better than what was there before. An improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For me it totally justifies the $8 a month fee. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More features like that please.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: And yes Musk's politics are horrible, as are the politics of people who run a lot of companies whose products you use. But Musk's horribleness is in our faces. At some point Tesla and Starlink are going to suffer for it, as Twitter is now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in May 2017 when I decided finally to give up on trying to peer with social networks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In the last few months the net effect of ChatGPT has been an order-of-magnitude improvement to searching the web. This time the innovating could not have been done by a duo like Jobs and Woz working in a garage, or a lone programmer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt;. It required a multi-billion dollar investment, and what amounts to decades of R&amp;D, before any benefit was available. This is an event we will have a much greater appreciation for on the other side, from this side all we can see is how much better it is than what we had before. I've been to this place before. It's the best time to be in tech.</description>

			<description>Just read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblogs.com&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; on weblogs.com. I didn't &quot;decide&quot; to shut down the site in 2004. The management of UserLand at the time transfered the domain to one of my two servers at a local Boston-area hosting service, without telling me they were doing it. It knocked the server off the air. That was what caused the outage. It took a few days to get it back online. The secret -- we converted the site to PHP and it ran much better. No one &lt;i&gt;decided&lt;/i&gt; anything.</description>

It's only been around for two or three years, I guess launching during the pandemic was bad for business? Interesting place, new construction but designed to feel like an old time gas station and garage. The food was pretty awful, and the expectations were high because the restaurant is an offshoot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenicia-diner-phoenicia&quot;&gt;Phoenicia Diner&lt;/a&gt;, which is excellent, and always super crowded on weekends. Why was the quality was so different? Something of a puzzle, but you couldn't just walk up to the counter and ask Why does the food here suck given that we were expecting greatness? The great thing about living in this area of clean air, and quiet natural beauty is that the food is so good. Has a lot to do with the artist community, the abundance of music, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culinary_Institute_of_America&quot;&gt;Culinary Institute of America&lt;/a&gt; being just across the river.</description>

			<title>&quot;Open web&quot; is redundant</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've realized that &quot;open web&quot; is redundant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with &quot;indie web&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The web is open. Its users are independent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the web is too precious to be taken over by self-preserving tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It wasn't meant to be a sweeping statement, or a forever thing. It was over &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/0041fbe8-b00e-478a-88d2-c3427abb6913&quot;&gt;ten years ago&lt;/a&gt;.

On the other hand, I've spent the last two years on building &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;new software&lt;/a&gt; for feeds, so obviously I don't feel it's over, actually I think it's is exactly what we need to sew the open social media world together. Small pieces loosely joined. RSS, and formats that came after it, are all about weaving a loosely joined web of blog posts and news articles. If we want it to work, we can make it work.</description>

I'm wondering if when that happened, I shouldn't have stepped up and tried to raise a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; reader from OpenSourceLand. But I don't think it could have happened. It's funny how people processed that event, I didn't see any anger at Google, which if my little old &lt;a href=&quot;http://userland.com/&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; had done something like that, there would have been a huge shitstorm. I think they manage their PR well because there's no one identifiable as the personality of Google, neither of the founders are visible. They don't tweet, you never hear anything about them outside of the business press. Same with the two people they've hired as CEO. Anyway, they treated RSS like an unwanted litter of kittens, put in a shopping bag and dropped from a bridge over a river. No thought to cleaning up the mess they created. They treated their users and the standard they took over like crap. But people need a &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; to be angry with. I'm much less consequential from a business standpoint, or user-control for that matter, my products get ignored mostly, but I am outspoken. And this makes me easy to be angry with. Anyway, I didn't step up because 1. I didn't think anything would come of it and 2. I didn't want to get embroiled in all the anger again. The last time it had nearly killed me.</description>

			<title>An old time MORE ad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Algernon found this MORE ad from the 80s and sent it along.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had been looking for it a few years ago, now I want to be sure next time, it'll be easy to find. Steve used to work at Living Videotext, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/117+Easy+St,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.3924404,-122.067555,122m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fb73b44beac6f:0x75582b6a9e573bd9!8m2!3d37.3923338!4d-122.0674987!16s%2Fg%2F11b8v422sp?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; this product was made. He went on to Apple, where he did system software. He was the one who got XML-RPC and RSS into the Mac OS in the early web days. &lt;i&gt;Thanks Steve&lt;/i&gt; for all of it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/01/moreAdThreeQuestionsTwoAnswers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&quot;He's got three questions. You have two answers. You need MORE.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Steve also sent along an &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/microtimesvolume00bamp_17/page/n49/mode/2up?view=theater&quot;&gt;article from 1985&lt;/a&gt; about me with my standard schpiel back in those days about how outliners came to be. The picture is funny, I was much younger of course, and my expression in the photo was as bewildered as often is. Oh yeah and I was wearing a suit and tie as people often did in business in those days. These days, it looks really funny. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
