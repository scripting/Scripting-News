			<title>Route around journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why journalists don’t bother trying to take Trump down, but do with the Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simple. Trump has routed around journalism as we have begged the Dems to by going direct to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The journos have no power over Trump and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They have total power over the Dems, and they know that too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If by some miracle the journos let us (voters) determine the president, we must &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; let them have this power again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had a post here about the inevitability of Biden stepping aside, then I turned on the news and saw how the press was humiliating the President at a meeting with the president of Ukraine. We can't give into this. How dare they insult the president as he represents the US in NATO. I can't get behind this. We're in a bad bad place.</description>

I just listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/coffeeNotesJuly11.mp3&quot;&gt;the show&lt;/a&gt; from this day 20 years ago. It was quite a throwback, lots of questions about what I was talking about, I've forgotten a lot of it. It took a full hour to prepare the feed. I can tell this is going to be quite a flashback experience. Maybe it'll get me in the mode to do some serious innovating, because we were on fire and didn't know it, in so many ways, back in the summer of 2004.</description>

The way the twitter-alikes do discourse is not the only possible way, and imho, and, as I've said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/17/howSpamWillLikelyEnterTheT.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; (in 2007!), most of what passes for discourse on twitter is actually spam, and that goes for Masto, Threads, Bluesky and Facebook (aka FriendFeed).</description>

			<title>Nancy Pelosi</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I kind of like what Nancy Pelosi is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She's got a unique role to play, as a master of Washington and national politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and giving her blessings to how they go forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the election. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how she and Biden get along.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's much better to have her leading this discussion than the children who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they don't understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I trust Pelosi in this situation, we're lucky to have her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Resuming the Podcast0 feed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new episode for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcast0/&quot;&gt;Podcast0 feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After a break since June 20, we now resume my original &quot;audio blog&quot; from the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers -- we'll have an original audio blog post. That's when the pulse really starts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/10/upcomingEpisodes.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of upcoming episodes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;morningcoffeenotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quantum-light-breath/id1752527298?i=1000661785816&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; page for this episode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I got the title wrong, it's Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it, and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast clients, I'm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as this one is)? I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I wonder if links make it through to most clients?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; for Podcast0.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.</description>

			<title>Jon Stewart, yes you should STFU</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The problem is elites grabbing the wheel with no clue about what comes next.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/14/bidenActionFigure.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Every Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart's opening for the Daily Show on YouTube. It's always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There's never been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren't any smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that's been the real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we've gotten the tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And now we're at the last moment before it's all flushed away and the NYT et al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don't think I've ever done that in a podcast, and I'm not sure I like it. But the rage is real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/09/yesJonStewartPleaseSTFU.m4a&quot;&gt;16 minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.</description>

			<description>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.</description>

			<description>I find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of my blog to be an incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;way&lt;/a&gt; to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

And she's working late tonight, trying to come up with the perfect cover story. She figured it out! She put a picture of herself on the front page, with a huge headline saying &quot;She's great!&quot; In the picture she's smart and cute and really adorable, and she's smiling and wearing a button that says &quot;Hi Mom!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/wordleKittyEICatNYT.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Wordle Kitty on the front page.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dear journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We all knew this would happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're going with him anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The plan is this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now everyone can relax.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak&quot;&gt;decloaked&lt;/a&gt;, an even bigger story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/&quot;&gt;View From Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>The SF newspaper strike of 1994</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/06/theSanFranciscoNewspaperStrikeOf1994.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I tell the story of the move from print to the web in 1994 when the San Francisco newspapers went on strike.

Now that the Supreme Court is no longer keeping up any pretense of respecting the Constitution, and journalism is either colluding, or preparing for their meeting with a military tribunal in March next year, followed by, if lucky, a re-education camp, we need help knowing what's real and what's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I was cheering out loud during the first segment. When you read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C864lCsuwbK&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see why. I tried listening to the NYT Daily podcast today, but it made me hate them all over again, starting with saying how great a week it has been for Trump. You can say that, imho, but you have to say right after that, that it was a terrible week for the rest of us. Because any good news for Trump is awful news for everyone else. And I do mean everyone, including the people who plan to vote for him again.</description>

It's got a really nice taste. Went to the store today, they only had one 12-pack, but they also had a 12-pack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/coca-cola/products/coca-cola-spiced&quot;&gt;Coke Spiced Zero&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to give it a try. I had a can at lunch and it's weird but okay I guess, but the belches are strongly flavored and that's &lt;i&gt;realllly&lt;/i&gt; weird. It took me a while to figure out where this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prevention.com/health/a32925734/why-do-my-burps-smell/&quot;&gt;belch-breath&lt;/a&gt; was coming from. It tastes like I took some very strong medicine. The weirdest soft drink I've ever had. But it kind of grows on you. I'll try another one and let you know how it goes.</description>

I have a pretty good idea upfront which ones those are. I go ahead and post them. At the first sign of flameage I turn comments off, with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0YQnqZuksa8nEHgCsEcvyJ5krLniGoFCrRRB2UHmjsDGosFycKorpskY9KuokgQkNl?comment_id=393461023707630&quot;&gt;simple explanation&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I turned off comments here. I didn't want to have a discussion about this, it's just an observation.&quot; I think this is totally legit and more people should do it. Really frees you up to say what you see.</description>
