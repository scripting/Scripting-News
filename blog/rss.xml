Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html&quot;&gt;MacWrite and MacPaint&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.</description>

			<description>We need a protocol for embedding a tweet in a web page. We used to have one with Twitter, but it now works only intermittently. Mastodon has one, and I have been able to use it. But really it would be nice to have a sort of jQuery of this stuff. If they're all going to create their own APIs we obviously need a container for that so developers don't have to worry about all of it.</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/12/mastoLogin.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; illustrates the core weakness of Mastodon. We need the ability to log on to Mastodon, not to an instance. A factoring of that functionality. It totally could work, some person, company, foundation or whatever could build software that acts as a simplifier. Have you ever used plex.tv? Somehow they manage to do it. You're connected to someone's server, but you log on through one site.</description>

			<title>AI and the NYT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Zach Seward, a friend from my days at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/about/&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; and NYU, got a kickass &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/&quot;&gt;job&lt;/a&gt;, starting up the AI effort at the NYT.  He's just the right guy for it. Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong startup journalism background. I couldn't think of anyone I'd want more to be in this position. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that he's published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; for a talk he gave at SXSW, it's time to share some ideas I have for the NYT re AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn't do. Not sure why. I'd like to be able to connect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;ai.nytimes.com&lt;/a&gt; and ask it to give me a rundown on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615&quot;&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; who's testifying in Congress today about how our president is &quot;elderly.&quot; I don't want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that answers the questions I have about the MAGA lawyer. Maybe the AI will just give me the story without the spin. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library&quot;&gt;big library&lt;/a&gt; in Jamaica (Queens)  going back through microfilm of the NYT from before I was born. So far all we've done is replicate the microfilm user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source material, used to answer very specific questions. Answer questions like &quot;has anything notorious happened in the neighborhood I grew up in, as far as the NYT knows?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians, journalists and others to study in the future, and, in the context of AI, feed it all kinds of perspective on the time we live in. Maybe in the future history won't be written by the winners (lotsa luck with that). Anyway, if at some point the NYT and other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and intelligence of the readers, why not start now? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; I care. When I stop criticizing you'll know that I've given up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alan Kay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707961&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of the Mac, it's the first personal computer worth criticizing.

			<description>Journalism talks about Trump's trials, but they are trials for the Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call&quot;&gt;he is&lt;/a&gt;) then if he isn't punished we no longer have the rule of law. So don't miss that we are on trial too. And -- when journalism frames the faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</description>

Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about." created="Mon, 11 Mar 2024 16:52:49 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/03/11.html#a165249"/>

			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; was a repeat of Saturday's. The reason was the switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time&quot;&gt;Daylight Savings Time&lt;/a&gt;. This happens every year. The fix is to edit stats.json in the mail sender app's folder, and change &lt;code&gt;whenLastUpdate&lt;/code&gt; to the day before, save it, and restart the sender app. It immediately sends out the correct email. I put this note here so I might find it next time it happens and I forget how to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Oh servers!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then this happened...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been having serious problems on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt; since Friday when I made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you'd get an awful error message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors. And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they still haven't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we're going to upgrade the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That won't happen today and probably not tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people probably don't know that feedland.com is a project I'm doing with Automattic. It's running in their cloud. This system should be able to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can't, where feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are many thousands of users, we should be okay. That's why I did the work to convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but it had to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on our main server in the last few days. I can't promise it won't happen again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases re-learned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's even worse than it appears and as they say -- still diggin! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The same data. There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; advantages to doing it that way. For some people that is what news.scripting.com will turn into. It's an on ramp to the world of collaborative feed subscriptions. The open social web, in feeds. Which is why we call it Feed&lt;i&gt;Land. &lt;/i&gt;You know The Land of Feeds. I like &quot;land&quot; names for products and companies. I started a company called UserLand a long time ago. I was skiing in Utah in 1989 when I decided on two names: UserLand and Frontier. I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from the Mac -- where the &lt;i&gt;Finder&lt;/i&gt; is the app you spend a lot of time in. So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and began with F. I know it's weird. It's also why FeedLand feels like a homey name to me. :-)</description>

			<description>Good morning. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest3/&quot;&gt;next tabs test&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday's test showed that tabs that switching between images is fine. The tabs never get hung up. Today's test is the same except one of the tabs is a FeedLand timeline. I want to see if somehow click events are getting lost on their way to the tabs manager.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest/&quot;&gt;next test&lt;/a&gt; for finding the conflict in my tabs code. I'm trying to isolate a problem with the tabs code I use in my blog, and in various pieces of software. Late last year, I decided to stop making new tabs systems, and to invest in a single great tabs manager. This app tests only that code. So I want to know if this works. I may add another test after a while, based on the results of this test.</description>

			<description>I got a text message from an unidentified person saying they were coming to SF soon for some event so now we could go for a nice walk on the beach. At first I wondered who this could be. I have a 415 number, but I live far away from Calif. My first thought this was a friend who didn't know I moved (in 2009 btw, must not be someone very in touch). Of course it's just phishing. D'oh. It's clever. I guess. I guess it isn't really that smart to send a message to a random 415 number and assume the person might live in the Bay Area.</description>

I usually like their reviews but this time I think the reviewer didn't understand. As I see it, it's hey check out what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Stone&quot;&gt;Emma Stone&lt;/a&gt; is doing now. Really entertaining because she is such a thrill.</description>

			<description>There's a problem on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; home page. On a mobile device, sometimes you have to click several times on a tab to get it to switch. It doesn't seem to happen in desktop browsers. Yesterday I finally got it to reproduce on my own machine, when emulating an iPad Mini in Chrome on my desktop. I added debugging code and set breakpoints, and had a theory that tooltips were interfering, which turned out not to be the case, but now that I can reproduce it here, I really want to get this solved. If you have development experience, or just like a good technical puzzle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/287#issuecomment-1983757115&quot;&gt;here's the thread&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>When I was a kid we used card catalogs, microfilm, encyclopedia and almanacs. Much later there was the web with search, Wikipedia and archive.org. Now there's ChatGPT. Each level was a dramatic improvement of the previous one. Now everything we're all working on is cast in a new context. They don't mean what they used to. What problem with the AI solve next?

			<description>Evan Prodromou &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@evanprodromou/post/C4OkHjlveLn&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that he has access to a feature in Threads that we don't have, which allows him to follow his Threads account from a Mastodon account. This is the easy side of interop, the other direction is more difficult, not technically, but from a regulation and PR standpoint. Facebook (they call themselves Meta now) heavily regulates what people can see on their network, and it's hard to imagine them not having an App Store like the ones on iOS and Android that allows certain services to peer with them and disallows the rest. This should be factored into people's thinking about the benefits of federating. It probably will feel fairly one-way.</description>

Also does he feel it's fair for a prosecutor to use his public platform to smear the reputation of an innocent person? And finally if there is no respect for the president as a person, what about the office, and the country the president serves? Does he have any respect for that? And did he expect to have the light shone on him for making such a bold and potentially damaging statement? And then let's find out why the journalists never shone the light on Mr Hur.</description>

			<description>BTW, in case you're wondering where &quot;still diggin!&quot; came from -- here's the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it's a lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there's more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It's like &quot;even worse than it appears.&quot; Still diggin is meant to say we know it's really futile, you don't have to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we feel somehow that next time it really will work. It's a Vonnegut-like or Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other words, realistic.</description>

			<description>I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted to be a writer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker&quot;&gt;Russell Baker&lt;/a&gt;. I was quoted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; in an op-ed. I have done some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html&quot;&gt;most successful work&lt;/a&gt; of my career with the NYT. I love journalism &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;like I love the Mets&lt;/a&gt;. I don't expect them to do great things every season, but I do hope for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; every once in a while. These days I don't have much hope for the NYT returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up in Queens in the 1960s. We &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing.</description>

			<title>How we learn to art</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it any other way? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever invented just to make something new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of that in software, people won't put in an API so you have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can make progress when people don't try to lock up their ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Individuals live just a short time, we can't do that much in a lifetime, but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and we build. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/selfportrait.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We learn by studying ourselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So why shouldn't our machines be able to learn too? They already can do things vastly more complex than we can. We've invented a huge lever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar Galactica. But those are stories, they didn't happen. The future is rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has come before is now in our hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/weWillUseIt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;We're going to use it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote the words, ChatGPT did the images. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
