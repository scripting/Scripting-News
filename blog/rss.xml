			<description>When Bluesky was experiencing its huge post-election surge, it was exciting because lots of us users were experiencing the surge in followers and engagement. It was exhilirating. That has slowed to nothing now, no more engagement there than on Threads, Masto or Twitter. The character limit on Bluesky being considerably less than the others makes it harder to rekindle interest imho. And btw the euphoria being gone is neither good or bad, it just is.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is also a tutor. I'm learning new ways of coding SQL through drill and it's also improving my JavaScript code. It's infinitely impatient. It does make mistakes, but that's also good for the drill, catching the mistakes is instructive too. And in programming you always have to be looking for errors, because you'll almost always find them. &quot;Runs the first time&quot; is a rare occurrence, no matter who wrote the code.&quot;</description>

			<description>I'm getting a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22apple+watch%22&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; today, the latest model. My current watch, which I wear all the time (except when it's charging) is a 5th gen. The new one is 10th. I had to upgrade because there's a Tesla watch app out now that won't run on my old watch. It's the most rational add-on for the car. A must-have.</description>

Aggregate all the shows from all the feeds in a list into a single feed. This seems brilliant because it reduces the implementation in the client to almost nothing, just rebuild a feed periodically, it could be done entirely in the client app. But it also could be something users could share with other users, sort of a meta-channel. I think it's brilliant with the caveat that sometimes when you implement it you find something that makes it more complex than it seems at first. This is the second idea I've heard that the initial listening lists idea spawned. I think there's a lot of unexplored possibilities here.</description>

I have no problem with that, because his son was accused as a proxy for his father. If there is any legitimate use of presidential pardons, this is it.

They're playing their own game, trying to self-pardon in a way, to avoid being a target for the incoming administration, which we're all scared of, and I guess that's the point, to scare us.</description>

			<title>We need a BDG for Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/pfefferle.org/post/3lcfkqqlcfk2j&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky this morning from a friend, Matthias Pfefferle, who works at Automattic on the connection between WordPress and ActivityPub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A BDG is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide&quot;&gt;Busy Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, something we did &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;for SOAP&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; onto it.  Since then there have been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It's a useful concept because developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that works, and we'll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop, which is the point of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user's writing in a PDS. If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it works there. We can do that because we're using popular simple formats like JSON (see below) to organize our work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you're reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; in a repository on GitHub. Broken down into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07&quot;&gt;months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07/18&quot;&gt;days&lt;/a&gt;, and posts. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each post is a JSON file, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2019/03/03/a025810.json&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. It has three bits of data, the text of the post, when it was created (which also serves as a unique ID, no two posts have the same creation date) and type. This item has a type of outline, because it can have structure, though this post does not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2022/07/06/a232835.json&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; that does have structure. In Bluesky it would be represented as a thread. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the question. What's the absolutely simplest way to have that structure of posts represented in a Bluesky PDS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/674f3d6c-4904-8012-b071-953862cd5b4a&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT to scope this out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds.

			<description>I'm using the term &quot;RSS-based podcasts&quot; in place of &quot;podcasts&quot; to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other &quot;podcasts,&quot; are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their &quot;podcasts&quot; to RSS and everyone's happy. Like &quot;organic cheeseburgers.&quot; :-)</description>

			<description>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</description>

			<description>Welcome to the last month of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!</description>

			<description>I wasn't clear enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. We're losing the word &quot;podcast&quot; very quickly. It's coming to mean video interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there's no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who will want to impose severe limits. This isn't a casual &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt;, it's &lt;i&gt;urgent.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

And when they want to edit the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasn’t been moving  and if we don’t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get started.</description>

			<title>The Kennedy v Nixon template</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Analogously, Trump is Kennedy and Biden/Harris is Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the social web is, in 2024, what TV was in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump has mastered the new medium. To a large extent, he &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; the new medium, and the resulting network formed around him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-did-trump-win-james-carville-has-discovered-an/id1728152109?i=1000678267539&quot;&gt;Carville says&lt;/a&gt; he wants to figure out how to communicate the way Trump did, he can't because our way doesn't work in his universe. We have to create our own. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogously Nixon might have said about TV in 1959 -- how can we get into that? If you have to ask you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; get there. You have to fit like a hand in a glove, like Kennedy or Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next Democratic candidate to win the presidency will have to be a media creator. They must create a medium that's perfectly adapted to the communication interests of the 50 percent of the electorate that voted for Harris and the other 20 percent who would if they just knew who she was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look at the picture of Kennedy and Nixon. Did we elect Kennedy over Nixon because he had better policy? No. We elected him because he has better hair. Because on TV what counts is your hair. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chris+lydon&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; who was a TV news person told me that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/28/kennedyNixon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kennedy and Nixon on the debate stage in 1960.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to win, create an internet farm system. A network with everyone who wants to run for office nationwide on the Democratic ticket. And let's see how they work in the new medium. We get to know them like we knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/11/26/weElectedArchieBunker.html&quot;&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. And let's get some people we get to know who also tend to tell the truth (though they can screw up and we'll forgive them, remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;gotchas&lt;/a&gt; are over).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That value wasn't priced into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/twtr&quot;&gt;TWTR&lt;/a&gt; stock. No one listened. Here's the next installment. The US government acquires Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The &quot;constitution&quot; reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems, they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been &lt;i&gt;cartelized,&lt;/i&gt; which is one step beyond &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/22/214100.html&quot;&gt;enshitified&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>If such a network existed, we would be nominating our own Cabinet members, the shadow Cabinet. Let the journalists compare the qualifications of our candidates vs the incumbent party's. Create news. That's what the Dems absolutely suck at. They very quietly pass legislation that the other party (which votes against) takes credit for. One party is on the air, the other is not. We need to change that. We make news. And we listen to each other, not just the stuffed shirts who run the party now.</description>

			<description>Rule #2. You have permission. If you want someone else to do something, and they haven't done it, or you don't want to wait, you have permission to do it yourself. You can invoke this rule when someone says &quot;who do they think they are.&quot; You had permission, according to rule #2.</description>

In &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67435186-f804-8012-a29c-4d5ecce996f9&quot;&gt;this query&lt;/a&gt;, I learned about how Republicans deal with intersex people and bathrooms, they apparently don't. Not surprising, to tell the truth.</description>
