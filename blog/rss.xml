			<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories on what's actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a love story between Carol and Zosia. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; fall in love with a person with no sense of self. They plotted to have Helen killed, and waited until Carol's &quot;f*ckable&quot; judgment turns into real love. They get married and everyone lives happily ever after.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Alternate theory -- the original people are still in their bodies, suppressed to keep quiet. Inside they're screaming to be saved, as pissed off as Carol. They want their bodies back. They have the ability to write messages on their skin, so what Carol saw at the end of the last episode was a corpse with the words HELP ME! visible on the body's belly.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another alternate theory about the end of the last episode -- it took a moment for Carol to recognize her own body, possibly dead, and realizing this is all a dream. It's another version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20matrix%22&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, where this is the fake reality that we've been seeing. None of this is really happening. (Like the end of the Bob Newhart show?)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also is Plur1bus like Saul Goodman, in that if you say it a different way it has a message encoded?
