			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-Xr_dcp8Vn&quot;&gt;Bruce Springsteen&lt;/a&gt; mention at last night's rally was no accident. Boomers are now of the age where we vote in great numbers. So our feeling like there's something here for us might make the difference in one or more of the swing states.</description>

			<description>Last night's Democratic rally was wonderful. I was laughing and sobbing all the way through it. What an emotional release. We needed and deserved this. Beyond hope, we're finally going to fight. I hope President Kamala is really up to it, because we have a pretty substantial cleanup job to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States_(2024)&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Democratic Party greatness</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have great respect for Hillary Clinton and supported her over Sanders in 2016. I also supported Biden because we needed to win in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we could have had a campaign team like the one we saw yesterday and today, with some very impressive presenters who've yet to take the stage, we could have had it in 2016. We didn't have to go through the tragedy of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats are stage managing perfectly now. I never really thought we'd see this day, but here it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/07/wordleKittyOnTheRoad.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Our favorite kitten is on the road with the Democrats.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Walz is Harris' choice. Picking Shapiro would have been leading with her chin because of Netanyahu. Walz looks older than her but they're actually the same age. And he figured out the right word to get under Trump's skin, so there's that. He just has to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weird&quot;&gt;weird&lt;/a&gt; in campaign speeches to bring down the house.</description>

			<title>Roadmap for the campaign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A roadmap for the campaign is coming into view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Harris has her knee on Trump's neck, and she won't let up. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There won't be time for anyone to get tired of her. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Their rallies are going to be the best in a very long time. They're executing perfectly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump is a comedian, a cross between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt; with a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kinison&quot;&gt;Sam Kinison&lt;/a&gt;. He had a good schtick for a long run if you find fascist slapstick entertaining, as millions of Americans do or did. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Last night Maddow tried to get us excited about how the Repubs have planted people on voting boards in swing states with the purpose of stopping the counts, and thus preventing a vote in the Electoral College. But they're doing it too late. The administrators will feel the tide turning too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This campaign will take place in the popular culture of 2024, which thankfully is not centered on cable news or the NYT. But Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are in control. In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;2017 piece&lt;/a&gt; I thought Zuck would run for president, given his new style &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/06/zucksNewStyle.png&quot;&gt;makeover&lt;/a&gt; I wouldn't discount that, but these two will certainly have  influence over how the election goes. Both Facebook and Twitter have algorithms that are opaque and controlled by them. Same deal as with the owners of cable media. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump stoked resentment with voters for being left behind, even if individually they were doing fine. But that was eight years ago and a lot has happened. Harris saying basically &quot;there you go again&quot; is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN7gDRjTNf4&amp;t=46s&quot;&gt;echo of Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, btw. It worked for Reagan, you just have to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/derision&quot;&gt;derision&lt;/a&gt; right. And Harris can do that, she laughs and we laugh. Trump loses his mind.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Harris candidacy happened almost as if it was staged. The campaign hit the ground running, it feels like there was a lot of advance work. Or they picked bloggers who were up and running, gave them the keys and said go. Either approach is fine, breaking through where previous Demo campaigns didn't have the nerve. Whatever it is, there's a sign of competence and urgency in the Democrats that is grounded in the challenge not in some almost religious sense that she's The One, which was understandable with Obama, but won't do now. We have no illusions about what's ahead. I think for that Biden must have been a great teacher. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now we're grounded. We've seen the outline of our future. Our eyes were fully opened on Jan 6. A few weeks ago the lead Republican thinker behind Project 2025 &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4757210-heritage-blowback-bloodless-revolution/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, like an idiot, in an interview, it was up to liberals to avoid a bloodbath, as they took over. You don't hear that anymore. Those people must now be thinking more seriously about jail for what they're doing. And the Supreme Court will go to jail too if they try to support what Maddow was talking about. We must not let them overthrow the government. And that's why Maddow's concern is okay but overstated, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had my doubts whether Biden would stop the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dissolution&quot;&gt;dissolution&lt;/a&gt; of the Supreme Court, and I don't know if Harris will, but given how purposefully the campaign in running, I suspect (hope, pray) she will. Our job is to give her the support she needs to feel that we've got her back. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: FDR &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/83fbfae5-d28d-4332-bda1-480fed1e9584&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to pack the court in 1937. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If you haven't listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/04/195427.html&quot;&gt;Sunday's podcast&lt;/a&gt;, please do. It's just 12 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>JD Vance is a punchline, illustrated</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to illustrate this idea: &quot;JD Vance is a punchline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/04/jdVanceIsAPunchline.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&quot;JD Vance is a punchline.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's time to create our own media, again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're depending on big companies that are nuzzling up with Trump, at best hedging their bets, to let us use their networks to organize ourselves politically. That's never worked for us, in fact it's worked against us. Trump's election in 2016, for example, could he have done it without Twitter letting him go direct to organize? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Harris organization is doing great, they have to take on the journalists, where previous Democrats had no answer, they've done it in a clever way, by using their channels to talk about the things journalism should be talking about. People listen to their competition, and that's what this is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to do this, a few of us, who are good listeners and writers, to build lists of sources and provide them for people to access away from the nonstop (often entertaining) bullshit of the social web of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked for ideas for podcasts that would go into a list of shows people who are voting Democratic would find interesting or useful. Not for spreading religion, but based on facts, not the unhinged lunacy and revenge of Trump. Our news now is too polluted by that. He shouldn't be able to lie about Harris's race, and have that be an issue carried by journalism, for example. That should not be possible but it happens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/04/timeToCreateOurOwnMediaAgain.m4a&quot;&gt;12 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a computer-generated &lt;a href=&quot;https://recorder.google.com/b5aa5e3f-2164-4005-a302-38d5919775eb&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Kitten trashes suite</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I solve a Wordle puzzle, I'm allowed to switch over to ChatGPT and narrate a new scene for the Wordle Kitty. Here's today's installment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The cute and adorable Wordle Kitty, Democratic VP candidate, got tired of waiting for the Republican, so she took a few of the reporters with her back to the presidential suite at the Plaza Hotel on 5th Ave and had a drunken night of debauchery with the reporters and totally trashed the place. The next morning the story appeared in The NY Times. Headline read “Adorable kitten trashes suite.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/04/kittyTrashesSuite.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;What remains of the Presidential Suite at the Plaza Hotel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Now that I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/26/150516.html&quot;&gt;voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; that creates transcripts exactly where I need them, I can feed the narration to ChatGPT and ask it to write docs based on features I describe that are part of the current software, and leave out notes about possible changes or additions. It took me 13 minutes to do the narration, because I talk more slowly than it writes, and I ramble and get distracted. It took the bot less than a second to produce a near-perfect outline. It left out a bit that I wanted included, it was added in a second. Then I asked for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; version of the docs so I could edit it, and pass back the edited version. It got a bit confused and gave me a JSON version of the outline, and Node.js code to convert it to the XML, but when I pointed out a simpler way to do it, I got what I needed in less than a second. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/docsOutline.png&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;, in my outliner, ready for me to add notes, and edit and reorganize. ChatGPT is a team member, not a surrogate. Another amazing experience, absolutely no going back.</description>

			<description>Saw a video where Elon Musk talks about climate change, no snark, didn't call it a hoax, was intelligent and serious. Also heard that he's backing Trump for president, who  says it's a hoax and one of his major campaign promises is to &quot;drill baby drill.&quot; Maybe they could discuss this because there seems to be a disagreement here.</description>

			<title>The Kitty at the Carnegie</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wordle Kitty is rumored to be the VP choice for the Dems. She is at the Carnegie Deli in NYC to meet the Republican VP candidate, to talk about a debate, but the Repub is a no-show! Weird. Meanwhile the press is having fun asking her embarrassing questions about a cat in the White House. They want to know if the WH has a litter box. What if she gets pregnant? Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/03/kittyAtTheCarnegieDeli.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Such a big sandwich for such a cute kitty! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tonykahn.org/home&quot;&gt;this autobiographical site&lt;/a&gt; where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn't often credited. He was at WGBH at the time.</description>

			<description>Where is the AI-based meme maker for Kamala. I'd like to have her flying in the sky with a cape, like SuperPresidentLady, going from town to town, finding out what they need, and churning it out for them in an efficiently run government meme factory in the nation's capital.
