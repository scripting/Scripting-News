It farms the job off to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, which shoots the text back to Bingeworthy as the user publishes to WordPress and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, in Markdown. So the text is on both BW and WP and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse&lt;/a&gt;. And through WordPress it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/industry-was-great-until-the-end/&quot;&gt;presence on the web&lt;/a&gt;. This is the goal, writing exists on its own, but can be shared in all the contexts it makes sense in, but it lives primarily in your blog, your home base. That's why WordPress is so important in the scheme of things. It's a consensus, this is where a lot of people are blogging in 2025. And there's a lot of mostly unexplored interop. And they don't break developers. This may not make total sense at this time, but soon, I hope to be able to point back at this post, and say it was the first time something important worked.</description>

			<description>BTW, actually the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; is probably too big a compromise. The &quot;web&quot; part is the only part that's imho useful. The sad part is that &quot;social&quot; means &quot;we removed most of the features of the web.&quot; Why? Some vague sense that people would write too much if given the space. Or link too much. Or edit too much. Or be too emphatic. It's worse than Disneyfied -- at least at Disneyland you get actors, and color and rides, and bland food with tons of sugar and fat. But there is some fun and nutrition. In the social web, it's just memes and slogans. Not even much room for a metaphor. There's so much more to say about being human.</description>

			<description>In the last days of Trump's first term, I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/howlongfortrump/&quot;&gt;nice little web app&lt;/a&gt; that told you how much time remained in his term. It was a one-line change to make it work again, which, sigh, is necessary now.</description>

			<title>Twitter, in hindsight</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRQtjVzj1bo&quot;&gt;great scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men&quot;&gt;No Country For Old Men&lt;/a&gt;, where a character is facing imminent death, but he's arguing with the character who will kill him, who asks if all your great ideas led to this (his death) how good were the ideas (paraphrasing).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Along those lines.. If Twitter was such a great idea but it led to the death of democracy (for now at least) maybe it wasn't such a great idea. Maybe when we try to reboot we should try something &lt;i&gt;realllly&lt;/i&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5543-insanity-is-doing-the-same-thing-over-and-over-again&quot;&gt;As they say&lt;/a&gt; -- Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This started as a thread on Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Pam McQuesten, dear friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sad news: Longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Pam+McQuesten&quot;&gt;Pam McQuesten&lt;/a&gt; passed away on January 1 after a brief illness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681058035952686/posts/1681610715897418/&quot;&gt;knew Pam&lt;/a&gt; in Silicon Valley, as we were starting up Living Videotext in 1983. Our office was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Elwell+Ct,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94303/@37.4320011,-122.1062105,1048m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fba3f1e2d0db3:0x2fd030af404448b3!8m2!3d37.4320011!4d-122.1036356!16s%2Fg%2F1tgb__w0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;Elwell Court&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto, just off 101, near the golf course and airport. Pam was managing editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)&quot;&gt;BYTE&lt;/a&gt;, the class act of tech pubs in the early personal computer business, then editor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Computing&quot;&gt;Popular Computing&lt;/a&gt;, the magazine for the people (ie users of computers). When she was at BYTE, her office was on the same floor as ours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tech industry was rough even then, all the young egos, people who were sure they could do everything, not much collaboration, lots of betrayal. She was one of the few people I could talk with on a personal level, with trust and intelligence. We talked about the future of the technology we were creating, and what we wanted from all this. She was a mentor, like a big sister, best friend, someone I trusted and loved. A very rare friendship. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, her name in the 80s, before her marriage to Paul McQuesten, was Pam Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our paths crossed again a few years ago on Facebook. I invited her to join a private group I have with friends I love and trust, to share the life I had at my &quot;pond house&quot; in the Catskills. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to post a brief remembrance here in case any of Pam's friends are tuned in, so they can be part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681058035952686&quot;&gt;celebration of her life&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/20/pamMcquesten2010.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Pam McQuesten in 2010 via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/nitle/4523727367&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

To do that with RSS you would start with a blogging app like WordPress, and a feed reader like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm going to approach it in a somewhat differently, not sure yet how it will work, but I'm getting there. And I will offer a way for people to hook in any feed reader they want, thus opening up innovation to tech-curious users. The take-away is that you need to handle inbound and outbound feeds. That's the basics of being twitter-like.</description>

			<description>When I put an image in the margin of a post I often pause and think about what I want to convey with the image as it relates to the writing that it's next to. In the previous piece the idea was interop. I tried to think of what images I've used in the past, then I thought why don't I just look. I switched into Daytona, entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I loved, but then kept scanning, and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; that I liked even more. Tools are important. Web writers haven't gotten any new tools in a long time. All the tool development has been for other stuff. Let's make tools for users again, as we did in the olden times. Craftwork in software. Playin in the band!</description>

			<description>Then, I got a response from &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/nickweaver/status/1880601723330506958&quot;&gt;Nick Weaver&lt;/a&gt; and the Madison story continues: &quot;Here’s a roundabout Madison connection for you. I started working at UW 28 years ago today as the World Wide Web Editor in the Office of News and Public Affairs. My first project was to implement Userland Frontier for the university news page.&quot; Now Nick is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison&quot;&gt;my Madison story&lt;/a&gt; too. And he mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=UserLand%20Frontier&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. With Frontier, we not only had the internet over networks, we also had networks on our computers because Frontier could send tasks to scriptable apps, and get back results. So databases could be hooked up to page layout programs, and people could use their writing tool of choice, and didn't have to use some teeny little excuse for an editor provided by a company that doesn't cater to or care about writers. Imagine writing with software that was designed to hobble writers instead of glorify them! That's the horror of the world as proposed by Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, all of them. It's like no one stopped to think about what they are doing, half their product is writing, and they suck at writing and have no plans to improve the situation. Geez Louise, it's as if we collectively lost our minds.</description>

			<description>Anyway, today I hooked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. Bingeworthy doesn't have a text editor, and it doesn't need one, because when it wants to offer a user a chance to explain their rating, like &quot;seasons 1 and 2 were great, but season 3 sucked, but I gave it a high rating anyway,&quot; they can use WordLand which loves writers and strives to serve them better and better. Why should I put a bullshit editor in a product (Bingeworthy) that isn't about writing. Its job is very different from WordLand's. Let them work together. That's the big idea, that's why you bother having &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, so you can use more than one tool on the same data.</description>

It's basically fairly stupid, but a way better search engine than Google. Also, it never says it doesn't have enough info to answer the question and then an hour later you figure out the answer it gave you just doesn't work. I still think it's an incredibly useful too, just not as great as I used to think. In a couple of years it has never asked for more information before it answers. That's a clue.</description>

We can celebrate the day when that feed is mirrored on Bluesky (Inbound RSS ftw!) and we can shut down the stupid app that does the bridging. We had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; long before Bluesky came along, isn't it wrong for them to try to force everyone to use their reinvention? It doesn't say anything good about the people who made that choice, among interop-minded developers. It kind of violates our ethos imho.</description>

			<title>An internet of ideas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use one of Twitter's successors.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d&quot;&gt;Here's one&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We should be able to tweet from within any application that has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little text boxes.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d&quot;&gt;And another&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted in there being room for only very simple ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before. Oy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;? I don't want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly what we're talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo. But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such thing. If you're federated that means you peer with your competitors. Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg's company these days, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/&quot;&gt;cut off&lt;/a&gt; an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might also want to hook into flow from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.org/&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;. I never believed in their support of the fediverse. Now let's get some reality into these discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x&quot;&gt;On Unix&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that works like that. I hope I have, to some extent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the tech world. Who could've seen that coming? Not me. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x&quot;&gt;Radical idea&lt;/a&gt;. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.&quot; I don't like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used to say stuff like that about me. It's a substitute for trying to understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned about creating open technology is you attract people who don't contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it's crazy. If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just trust the universe. But giving people orders, there's no place for that. Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent that we can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If you want a clue, listen to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; from January 8, and then if you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316&quot;&gt;ask them here&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd. I also don't believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy&quot;&gt;Tooth Fairy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Glinda&lt;/a&gt; the good witch of the south. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/&quot;&gt;half of the report&lt;/a&gt; on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise.

Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;enough followers&lt;/a&gt; to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up.

				<source:outline text="Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an internet of ideas.

				<source:outline text="Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;? I don't want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly what we're talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo. But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such thing. If you're federated that means you peer with your competitors. Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg's company these days, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/&quot;&gt;cut off&lt;/a&gt; an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might also want to hook into flow from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.org/&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;.

Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.&quot; I don't like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used to say stuff like that about me. It's a substitute for trying to understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned about creating open technology is you attract people who don't contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it's crazy. If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just trust the universe. But giving people orders, there's no place for that. Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent that we can." created="Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:02:11 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/14/131116.html#a130211"/>
				<source:outline text="I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks.

I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd.

				<source:outline text="One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/&quot;&gt;half of the report&lt;/a&gt; on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it.

They think the only application of AI technology is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two very different approaches to the same technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316#issuecomment-2583279043&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; from Phil Jones re Wednesday's podcast. I'm glad to get to answer these questions. There's more to wpIdentity than is obvious at first glance, for example it has a relatively complete storage system built in for developers to use. I used one of its features yesterday in the connection between Bingeworthy and the profile display app.</description>

			<description>BTW, I'm going through all the episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt;, and find it's influencing how I write. A good bingewatch is like that. You become one of the characters, or in a way, all of them. Sometimes I'm Swearingen and other times I'm Wu. Etc.</description>

			<title>GitHub and chatbots</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We need an AI chatbot that can work with GitHub repos. That is, in my prompt I say, the following questions are about this GitHub repo. At that point it is ready to answer any question about the project. This an incredibly important intersection of capabilities. As far as I can tell, GitHub doesn't offer it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating that people will suggest I use their editor, I don't want to use their freaking editor. This keeps coming up everywhere. You can't use this or that unless you use their editor. Insidious form of lock-in. And it also limits their market to people who use their editor. Shortsighted and stupid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to start thinking about choice. If it applies to developers, it's more likely they will follow through in the designs of their own projects and give their users choice as a matter of principle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to use a chatbot that incorporates the philosophy of the open web. They have opinions btw. One of the first things Claude.ai does when I give it some JavaScript code is that they &quot;modernize&quot; it. That is also insidious. I choose which constructs I use carefully, and follow the rule that one way to do something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bots can be bullies because the companies that make them are tech companies and thus shortcuts to make money, and thus handicap their users. Maybe the users are starting to figure this out. One can hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's all about WordPress, a product that you won't read much about on this blog, going back through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't paying attention until 2023 when I began to see what an amazing product it is, not just for 2004 when it came out, but in 2024. My theory is that it's the basis for an incredible social web platform, much better than Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky and of course Twitter. That's what I'm talking about for 1/2 hour in this podcast. If you give me that much time, I'll change the way you see the world, or at least the way you see me. I think I'm right about this, with another layer on top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of WordPress. The fact that they aren't gives a clue as to how portable your work is there, and how little choice you get in writing tools. Anyway, please make the time to listen. This is pivotal, and I don't think I'll ever be able to spell it out in writing, it's pure storytelling. Thanks!</description>

			<description>Just found an exponential memory leak at the database level in Bingeworthy. I have never seen one of these in all my years of programming. A data structure that saves a copy of itself in itself. So every time it saved it became exponentially bigger. Until it made the SQL server crash because the JSON object it was storying was over the limit of JSON objects. Crashed the freaking server. Fixed. Feels good.</description>

			<description>As part of the conversion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, I started the database from scratch, but before I did that, I exported &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/tree/master/data&quot;&gt;all the data&lt;/a&gt; and put it in a GitHub repo. This included a JSON file of ratings for each user. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/users/davewiner.json&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my file. Remember we used Twitter identity then, &lt;i&gt;davewiner&lt;/i&gt; is my Twitter username, just replace my name with yours to see your file, if you were a Bingeworthy user in the past.</description>

Zuck said &quot;we're on board.&quot; Now it's expedient to say to another group that he sees things their way, and it just so happens to be the very people most people who were looking to get away from in 2023 when he was loving the Fediverse. Now we're doing the same thing with Bluesky. And &lt;i&gt;it's going to happen again. &lt;/i&gt;There will be a moment when you look back on your &quot;hope for the best&quot; approach and realize that it didn't work, and if I'm around I will remind you again. We have to roll up our sleeves and make an &lt;i&gt;open social web&lt;/i&gt; that can't be sold out.
