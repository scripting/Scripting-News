Almost no disagreement. I'd add that we now are going to get another shot at conceiving a computer that's a lot easier to use, with the power of AI. Remember the example where I was able to specify what was basically an &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39&quot;&gt;SQL query&lt;/a&gt; in plain though precise English? That can also be applied to the user interface of a computer. Get me the phone number of the contractor I used to install the solar panels a few years ago. I'm sure the data is here on my computer, it might not be organized that way, but in a few months I'll have my own DaveBot who's read everything I've written everywhere and can answer all my questions (and yes, probably the CIA gets to ask questions too, let's hope Trump doesn't get elected, I'm not unaware of the dangers). And I won't have to remember how to build some app I wrote ten years ago. I won't even have to take notes. It's the paradise I never believed in is about to come to me.</description>

			<description>Last week at the reunion I got to spend a lot of time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/9cfa6104-b120-4ed0-879e-1e7b1939cdd1&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt;, which was great. We're both getting old, and one of these times will be the last one, but for now we're both still kicking around ideas and actually doing some of them. One of the things we share is that when we write up an idea on our blog or in a book it's probably because we want to work with others to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; that idea. Really pretty much all the time. And it's disheartening and not at all flattering to hear someone thank you for giving them that idea. This is the saddest thing in my life and it keeps happening. An example, I once went to visit Adam Curry in Amsterdam and he showed me an office full of people he hired to do what I had already done. Adam did that over and over. The problem is you can't hire someone to be Doc or me. No matter how many rooms you fill with attractive people. When you try to do our ideas, we've learned, people seem to always miss the heart of it. Anyway someone reading this may someday work with the source of the idea they love to make it reality and I will have done my good deed for the day.</description>

Suppose you're going to use a new piece of software to write your blog, something you do every day. Instead of converting to the new software first and diving into production, I would ask you to play with the new editor on the side, on posts that don't matter, maybe even &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2023/09/03/hello-world/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; by ChatGPT, until you're sure it fits your workflow. To surface and report all bugs that are in your way, or find acceptable workarounds. And only when you're satisfied that it works for you, should you consider switching to the new editor for production work. In my experience working with users, they switch too early and then panic when they find the software doesn't work the way they think it should. More generally you have to learn how to work so you don't have to panic, and you can easily back out of the decision if you decide it isn't right. When you're in panic mode you usually only make things worse. If you can afford to put the problem down for a couple of days and come back to it, you'll get to work faster and probably with a better result. The most important thing in working with computers, if you feel like you're panicking, stop.</description>

			<description>One thing I have to thank Berkman for is my new confidence. What a boost that meeting was. It took me back to a day when there were a dozen people I worked with regularly who were really first rate, and I was able to participate at my peak, that I did something uniquely valuable and was appreciated for it. I feel a million times more confident this week after the homecoming last week.</description>

			<title>Dunkin' Donuts sandwich</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was leaving Cape Cod a couple of weeks ago, I stopped to charge my Tesla at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/22+Meetinghouse+Ln,+Sagamore+Beach,+MA+02562/@41.781639,-70.5408017,230m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e4c9923ec94abb:0x335d7a8eef5da98b!8m2!3d41.781616!4d-70.540223!16s%2Fg%2F11csf2z60h?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; that had a Dunkin' Donuts, so I went in and got a big ice coffee and a Sourdough Breakfast Sandwich, something I had never tried.

Since then I've had two more and I just love the sandwich. Seems like an incredible bargain. Two once-over eggs, a bunch of bacon and melted cheese in a sourdough sandwich.

			<description>I just tripped over a 2018 rewrite of &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/phoenix/&quot;&gt;Developing Better Developers&lt;/a&gt;. I remembered writing this, but never could find it. I need to tell Google when I search for site:scripting.com to also include site:this.how. If anything the bits on this.how are more important than the ones on the much larger scripting.com. I could give these instructions, just like this, to ChatGPT and it would understand. It seems to me Google could start allowing us to configure the way Google sees us using natural language like this. Google has really held back the open web, by doing what big companies &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; do when they achieve dominance. Things ether stagnate or more likely in Google's case, move backwards.</description>

I was on the NY State Thruway going north, a few miles south of the exit for I-90E to Boston, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot&quot;&gt;FSD mode&lt;/a&gt;, in the right lane, when I see a hundred yards or so ahead a car with flashing lights in the shoulder. Before waiting to see what FSD would do, I signaled a left turn, which is a clever feature that tells the FSD software to switch lanes. It started to do so, then the software must've noticed the car with the flashing lights and inbetween the two lanes it hit the brakes hard, and slowed us down to a dangerous speed, esp if there had been a car behind us. But there was absolutely no danger. The car in the shoulder wasn't even close enough to make a difference if we had remained in the right lane, but we were leaving it. And it tried to stop us in no man's land. Insane. Anyone seeing this behavior would have thought I was drunk. So next time something like that happens if I'm in FSD mode, I'm going to cancel it by turning the steering wheel slightly and taking over fully. I have trouble believing people who let this thing drive without overriding it regularly.</description>

One of these days there will be a platform that really pays attention to what developers create and makes sure users learn about them. Twitter was not that company. Like most tech companies they spent their dev relations money on the wrong things.</description>

			<description>Fixed a bug where every this.how doc would fail trying to load emoji images because it used an &quot;insecure&quot; address. I fixed it so now we can be sure no emoji images are being hacked by a router between AWS and your web browser. Hopefully someone will sleep better because of this. Me, I like fixing bugs so I feel good. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I have Spectrum cable, only because it’s the only way to get Knicks and Mets games. Otherwise I’d go back to YouTube TV, I like it better. Less money too. And now Disney has disconnected from Spectrum, taking ESPN with, it would a great time for everything to decouple and let’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/25/155932.html&quot;&gt;redo the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;. I'm wasting so much money just for two channels and so are a lot of other people.</description>

			<title>Federation vs Small Pieces Loosely Joined</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know, I went to a conference this week with lots of web thinkers, people I worked with 20 years ago. And after listening to them about the state of social networks, this is what I've come up with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's federation vs small pieces loosely joined. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'll go with the latter. The former is too complicated to work or deliver a benefit worth anything to anyone except chaos lovers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SPLJ delivers all the benefits, but is more fragile, probably slower, but easier to understand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Everyone has a radio station that broadcasts to the universe to which anyone can opt into listening to or not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's nowhere near as efficient as Twitter, but that's a good thing my friends. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The problem with Twitter is it makes everyone an easy target. This approach, well understood from the old days of blogging has the opposite challenge, getting anyone to hear you, but at least you can tune everyone else out, because that's the default. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The default on federated nets is the other way, everyone is on by default. This has been proven to be an awful approach, over and over. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Just because you don't know the lessons of the past doesn't somehow make you immune to them. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>First notes from the BKC 25 reuninon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My first thoughts on coming home, not well organized.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm back home after an incredible couple of days at the Berkman 25 year reunion. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was there 20 years ago. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We were on a roll toward inventing social media. We had learned a lot and were practicing it, and if we had continued, there's at least a chance there would be an open alternative to Facebook and Twitter now instead of all the trouble caused by their dominance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It probably wouldn't have needed much if any money, btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I believe investors would have wanted to invest on our terms in open source development at a university in 2003, but I didn't have the idea developed at the time enough to propose it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Very independently of my Berkman experience in 2014 I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; all about how an academic institution should welcome people back every few years to contribute to an ongoing open source project. If we had been able to do that for blogging, podcasting, RSS starting in 2003, and growing as the user base grew, with volunteers coming back to work on it whenever there was a need, and using the university to teach new generations how to do what the older generation knew how to do, I think it might have worked. At least it would have given the users a seat at the table when deciding how the technology would evolve. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It felt as if I had been forgotten in the Berkman world, but that was not the case. I was surprised at how much love there was there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I say if you get a chance to go back 20 years in time and hang out with the people you knew then -- &lt;i&gt;do it.&lt;/i&gt; So much of what you remember comes from the perspective of someone 20 years younger. You now know what happened. The story went on. You're in a fantastic place to learn, and you're also going to feel love stronger than you could have back then, because love grows enormously over time, even if you're not consciously aware of it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I described getting my fellowship at Berkman like being a kid, given a Harvard business card and told to go have fun. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hls.harvard.edu/office-of-event-scheduling-and-support/gallery-of-event-spaces/&quot;&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; knows how to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/08/harvardLawClassroom.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;classrooms&lt;/a&gt; for discourse.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Tomorrow is another travel day, returning to the mountains, and then Murphy-willing, head-down on a new product release.</description>

			<description>They just asked what mistakes did BKC make, and I learned for the first time in Charlie Nesson's talk that development was one of the early values, and when I came here, it was my hope was that we'd connect users and developers and make this a major activity of the university as I described in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/10/19/university&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/21/theJournoprogrammer.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. But BKC turned in a different direction, focusing on people who studied the internet, rather than people who made the internet.</description>

			<description>I'm listening to a speaker at the BKC reunion, a man I have great respect for but can't name due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; of this conference. He's talking about how to regulate AI, with the assumption that it's a looming catastrophe, without explaining why he feels that way, or why we should. As a reader of this blog you certainly know that I am very optimistic about the future of AI.</description>

			<description>Back in the 1970s when SQL was new, it was touted as an English-like database language. Now with ChatGPT you really can do database queries in actual English and it understands. Amazing. Whether the info is accurate or not (I suspect it is) is beside the point. It's doing something with language that has not been possible before. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39&quot;&gt;this query&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Make a table of 15 oscar-winning actors and actresses ranked by number of nominations, also include a column with the names of at most three of the movies they made that won best picture.&quot;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1698786873701695772&quot;&gt;full-length excerpt&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; piece on Twitter, and was surprised at the positive response. I had posted links to the full article many times, and mostly got flames from programmer priests, Googly trolls, but this time the message got through. It was RT'd 58 times, and got 24K views. Not bad for something most people would consider esoteric, yet is still fundamental the their continued freedom on the unowned open web.</description>

			<description>Just for fun the other day I asked ChatGPT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2023/09/04/christopher-lydon-and-amanda-palmer/&quot;&gt;150 words&lt;/a&gt; on Christopher Lydon and Amanda Palmer, wondering if it would find the connection between them. It wrote a paragraph profile on each, but did not discover that Palmer had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2IrTbWJxY&quot;&gt;written a song&lt;/a&gt; about Lydon. Note -- Google's search function totally made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=amanda+palmer+christopher+lydon&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js&quot;&gt;wpcom package&lt;/a&gt; for Node.js to make calls about a user's WordPress account. I want to know what sites the user is following in their reader app. But they don't document the high-level call for that function, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1.1/get/read/following/mine/&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; at the REST level. So I ask ChatGPT what to do and it gives me the code I need. In the past I would probably have been able to piece it together with guesswork, trial and error. Might have taken a whole day. Now I have it working while I'm still drinking my morning coffee. BTW, I also had ChatGPT do code review, and it spots an error, and of course I fix it, happily.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/111012177596560602&quot;&gt;Posted on Masto&lt;/a&gt;: I find that ChatGPT is far better than Wikipedia at recounting history I know the truth about. Less subject to human manipulation, imho. When we criticize the machines we should remember what we have to compare them with and we should get &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; act together. Imagine if the AIs wrote critiques about our accuracy.</description>

			<title>Ideas for sessions</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm dumping these into the the Activity Feed for the Berkman reuinion but thought I should post them here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT is a miracle. It's one of those things like VisiCalc, the Mac UI, the WWW or Pointcast that after experiencing it I knew everything had changed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What makes for a great conference experience? How to keep the interesting stuff in the room from spilling out into the hallway.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A session about all the ways we love and miss John Perry Barlow.

			<title>wpidentity package</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've reached a milestone in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpidentity project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpidentity&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be included in other servers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api.js&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/a&gt; for browser-based clients to call through the server to wordpress.com. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've got a couple of simple demo apps running. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thinking of hooking it up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a richer interface to WordPress content than &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_MetaWeblog_API&quot;&gt;I've had&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Apparently this is using the same API that their browser-based client, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso&quot;&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, uses. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have some definite ideas, but it's time for a break from development, off to schmooze with old and new Berkmanites.

The apps were offline until I could restart the server, and that sometimes meant hours of downtime.  That no longer happens. But now there's a different problem, sometimes I go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my news page&lt;/a&gt; on feedland.org and for a minute or so there's no response. Eventually I give up and try again in a new tab. Same thing. Eventually the problem clears and the server returns to it's normal performance. I'm starting to think about how I might isolate this problem. My theory is that the problem is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;appserver&lt;/a&gt; layer, not in FeedLand itself, because when it happens nothing is returned. If it were at a higher level, the lockup would be in the code that gets a timeline or feedlist or whatever, so you would see a menu at the top of the screen. But it's always the news page this happens on, come to think of it. Maybe I should start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/270&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on this in case other FeedLand users who are also developers (please) might have some ideas.</description>

			<description>It has been pointed out that I could use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/&quot;&gt;OpenAI platform&lt;/a&gt; to add commands to my outliner that are based on results of ChatGPT questions. For example, I could say (hypothetically) &quot;add a list for 10 random states under the bar cursor headline&quot; and it would be done. I hope to try that soon. In the meantime if you'd like to do it, the outliner I use is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, so you can do it, and share it with me and that would make me even happier. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Do I still use..?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Basically the answer is yes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have Facebook, Twitter, Bluesky, Masto1 and Masto2 in my browser chrome, and I check them roughly in that order.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since masto and bluesky have &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, the really important ones are in my main timeline in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't a political statement. No one cares which systems you use. I use these systems because the people there who I am connected to are interesting, or we have a personal relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People overestimate the value of their choices in social networks, as they also overestimate the value of their vote.

			<title>Albert Shanker in Woody Allen movies</title>

When Allen’s character, Miles Monroe, is brought up to speed after being cryogenically frozen for 200 years, he learns that civilization fell when “Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead.” This jest exaggerated Shanker’s reputation as a contentious union leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later, in the 1977 romantic comedy “Annie Hall”, Shanker’s name emerges again when Allen’s character shares a humorous quip about two magazines merging to form “Dysentery”, recounting that he told the joke to Shanker.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both references underscore Shanker’s significant presence in the socio-political landscape of the 1970s, immortalizing him in cinematic satire.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I use ChatGPT to help me write code. When it gives code examples, I'd like it to use my admittedly uncommon indenting style. Is there a way to do that?</description>

			<description>Why can't I have an editor that I can give ChatGPT commands to. I do it anyway, I just have to copy-paste the result into my editor. Couldn't it save me that step by being integrated, or even better if we had good standards for scriptable apps. We were getting started on that in 1990 when Apple blew it all up, btw. Just sayin.</description>

			<description>I really have to take the time to learn how GitHub co-pilot works. But I still want to use my editor. See the problem?? It's the same problem Slack has. Basically every software product of 2023 adopts the attitude that it is a world unto itself.</description>

			<description>Today's songs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDqjRGqpIU&quot;&gt;Margaritaville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwx-MlbAyJ0&quot;&gt;Come Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah it's not the greatest music as people are say, but these are music from a great part of my life. Youth, great friends, love, and a sense of purpose. Like many people my age, these songs have strong emotional value.</description>
