The author concluded it can't, and I agree. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3m3rq5wpk6e2u&quot;&gt;Here's why&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;One thing the blogosphere had that Substack can’t have is all parts were replaceable. You could use any blogging tool, and any feed reader and still be part of the world. Substack is a single company that has raised VC money. Vastly different incentives.&quot; And this has been tested. You have to use their editor to publish in their enviroment. They're  unable to let you see their product as part of a toolset, it has to be the whole thing.</description>

			<description>You know how the AI companies are all doing browsers. Why don't they have a local url that I could put into an &amp;lt;a&gt; element that pops up the result of a question asked of the chatbot. Something &lt;a href=&quot;ai://what_did_the_mets_do&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. When you click on the link you find out what the Mets did.</description>

We're going to need a lot of new things once he's done. There's going to be a lot of broken stuff that needs fixing. Feces covered monuments. Probably a new cemetary somewhere for his victims. But you know how when the Mets were defeated by the determined Yankees in Shea Stadium in 2000, we tore down the old stadium and built a new one. Same thing. The old White House will have served its purpose. We shouldn't even build a &lt;i&gt;new White House&lt;/i&gt; on that location, just like we shouldn't have built a skyscraper in place of the World Trade Center. I wanted to see a mosque and a synagogue, a new football stadium, perhaps. A nice park. A place for a camp fire. Anything but an indestructable office building. We have so many of them. But where are the spaces for kids to play and learn and be friends. No, in place of the White House, I want to see a gorgeous public library. A place of learning. And a softball field and a nice swimming pool. We can tell the kids that once a bad old man lived here, and we decided it'd be more fun to have a big playground instead.</description>

			<description>On my drive to Ottawa and back, I never had to wait for a charger, and it never took more than 1/2 hour to fill the battery to 80%. The chargers are often in places with restaurants or supermarkets. And it's good for my legs to get out of the car and walk for a bit.</description>

			<description>I wish WordPress had a &quot;home&quot; social network. The community is all over the place, on Twitter, Slack, Masto, Bluesky, GitHub, and probably a few other places. I hope to have a social network that is built on WordPress and RSS. It would be open to the public, and anyone could start their own, by running an easy to install piece of software on a server.</description>

			<description>I have to remember to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/10/19/what-i-did-on-my-trip-to-canada-part-1/&quot;&gt;use WordLand&lt;/a&gt; to post &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org&quot;&gt;to Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, because when I go in that way, I don't have a character limit and I can use styling. We were wrestling with this question at WC, how to market the feature in a way that would get people to go to WordPress to write for Mastodon. It would also be cool if you could turn on the ActivityPub connection in WordLand, without having to wade through all the menus and dialogs. Imagine if we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/19/activityPubDialog.png&quot;&gt;confirmation dialog&lt;/a&gt; like this in WordLand.</description>

			<description>I have a really interesting idea for Netflix. Do a MCP so I can ask ChatGPT to find a show I'd probably like on Netflix. Then Hulu would have to hook up too, and HBO and Apple and everyone else. That would fix a big entertainment problem because I've already taught ChatGPT exactly what I like in movies and serials by giving it all my favorite shows and why I liked them so much. This was the idea of Bingeworthy, which I never seem to find time to work on. I really just want the freaking functionality. Someone should buy Metacritic btw, their process, however it works, is really good at finding the good stuff. But please someone who believes in open APIs, it totally needs to be in the Chativerse.</description>

			<title>What I did on my trip to Canada, part 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I presented &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for the first time publicly, the new one with a timeline, so it more clearly shows how we can build a beautiful social network just from open formats and protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No user lock-in, every part replaceable, and open to developers to add functionality without having to reimplement the whole thing. These are all the things I think that have stood in the way of innovation in the web for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A social network that starts out with no centralization and open in every sense has a much better chance of being decentralized than one that starts out centralized and swears they're going to stop doing that -- someday, fingers crossed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back home from my trip to Ottawa. Took the scenic route through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Mountains&quot;&gt;Adirondacks&lt;/a&gt;. Had an unqualified great trip. Should've gone to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=WordCamp&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago. It's totally my type of people. I have a long list of things to organize, but for now it's time to catch up on sleep and rest, MLB and NBA, and make plans for the future.</description>

			<description>I'm back at &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; in a big room waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; to answer questions for the people here. Yesterday's presentation went really well, lots of smart people really interested, fantastic discussion after. A very nice web culture. I went with three slides to get started, and then talked, demo'd, answered questions, and listened to ideas. Told a few jokes. Got a few laughs. It got the job done, help feed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-of-mouth_marketing&quot;&gt;word of mouth&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Good morning from Ottawa</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bullets.opml.org/?url=https://drummer.land/dave.winer@gmail.com/wordcampSlides.opml&quot;&gt;link to the slides&lt;/a&gt; promised below. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been going back and forth on slides. I always do this. In the end I hate slides because I digress while going through them and skip ahead, end up wishing I hadn't used them. So I decided to compromise. I'll do the first three in some detail, and digress and go down tangents as I see fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The three main slides.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Accomplishments of WordPress. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why podcasting retained its independence. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Demo of WordLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were 20 or 30 more slides after that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what I'll do is this. Present the first two in some detail, then page through the rest quickly and come back and do the demo. Also publish a link to the deck on my blog so people can scroll through them at their leisure. And once the demo is done, I'll answer questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an idea that we can have a blogosphere that is as functional as podcasting. We just need users to get started, to get the idea off the ground. We don't have to accept the limits, we can have the full web if we want it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Times I've been ambushed at conferences</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I think I'm done. I've got the outline for the slides complete. I can't possibly talk about all the stuff that's in the slides. Once I leave tomorrow I think perhaps I'll post a link for the slides and maybe offer a place to comment. Maybe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I get very nervous about these things and then remember when I've prepared as much as I have for this, the talk goes quickly and people generally are nice, though I've been ambushed a few memorable times. Let's see -- Austin, Cambridge, San Francisco and Nashville come to mind. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Austin it was because I was privileged. I was being honored because it was the 25th year of my blog, and I was one of the keynoters. I told the promoter his people wouldn't like me, and then I forgot I said it when it happened. I was stuck, I didn't want to get into a public argument with anyone. (Had I wanted to rebut, I would have said everyone in this room is privileged, just look around at how well fed and educated everyone is. We all flew in here. We live in a rich country where we are the elite of the elite. Now STFU, in my dreams.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There have been times when I welcomed an argument...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, I was invited to lead a panel from the music industry about how great Napster was. This was probably in 2000 or 2001 when Napster was at its peak. It was an ambush. All the panelists made me the issue, and then they voted to kick me off the stage. I stayed there and waited until they exhausted their rage, and then asked them a question about music and Napster. Acted like nothing had happened. I had earned my place there, I was a very early industry adopter of Napster. I loved what it did for us. Imagine until then you either had to buy an album to listen to music, build a collection, or wait until it was played on the radio. (What is radio? Kind of an early form of podcasting.) People were talking about music in supermarkets and airports. This could not be stopped, I was sure of it, and they were acting like babies. I stood up and prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Nashville, I was invited to be a sort of keynoter for a conference that was patterned after BloggerCon. I did not organize it, but I led a session, which was attended by a famous right wing blogger who I had invited to the Harvard BloggerCon. He brought a bunch of his friends, and they each said no one was listening to them but we were listening to them. I eventually sat down and let them have a session dominated by a few people repeating themselves. It was boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I was set up by the promoters of a CMS conference which Berkman hosted at Harvard. I was the master of ceremonies. No one told me that one of my most virulent trolls was there, and when he got up to rage at me I asked him to sit down, but Charlie Nesson who was the senior educator there, and kind of naive about internet trolls, said he should speak his mind. I should have walked out at that point. I knew what was coming. It really shook me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Nashville a columnist in a local paper who said I caused the riot, btw. I swear to god I always take my discussion leader role seriously. I gave them all a chance to talk and they all said the same thing, almost as if they had been told to say it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The web crashes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's remember how the web could have worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The ideal is to write in our blog space, and publish everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what we have been trying to do since Twitter came along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Write on your main blog, cross-post everywhere it belongs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This could have worked, and it still can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it can't work until we get agreement on what text is. This will be much-discussed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Canada&lt;/a&gt; this week, based on what &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/plugins/activitypub&quot;&gt;WordPress is doing&lt;/a&gt; and what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Prodromou&quot;&gt;Evan Prodromou&lt;/a&gt; will speak about and of course what I am speaking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Getting back on track is as simple as agreeing what text is on the web. For that we have two very good models: HTML and Markdown.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/13/theWebCrashes.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Here's my slide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Sure there are bugs and things I wish worked differently, but I and a few other people use them as everyday tools. I'm trying to get WordLand with its timeline function to be that way. A bunch of new hookups via HTTP and Websockets.</description>

			<description>Today's song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3QZVdqUidw&quot;&gt;Oh My Love&lt;/a&gt;, by John Lennon. I was trying to remember this song. It kept eluding me. It's not one of his most famous. It's what you experience when you fall in love. Clarity. Endless possibility. At home in your life. For the first time.</description>

			<description>I know so many people around my age that were never told this simple truth that I heard Steve Jobs say in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kYfNvmF0Bqw?si=NYOyLWJRnXuvCktP&amp;t=39&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; the other day. Paraphrasing -- the people who made the rules you think you have to live by weren't smarter than you. Once you accept this as fact, then if you can find the leading edge you can make it work the way you want it to. You can be one of those people.</description>

			<title>The social network of the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was just catching up on tweets and saw an &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ryanwelcher/status/1975704588985778593&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that Matt Mullenweg is going to lead a town hall discussion at WordCamp Canada next Friday in Ottawa. A week from today. I find that exciting. I'll in the room for sure, and blogging it. Why not? ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am presenting the day before, where I'll do a demo of the new WordLand, explaining how it's now twice the product it was last time you all saw it. It is still centered on WordPress as the place where all the user's writing is published. And somehow through the magic of software, we manage to make it into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/05/boostrappingADecentralized.html&quot;&gt;social network&lt;/a&gt;. And the cool thing about the whole stack of software we build on, all of it is replaceable and of the web, in every sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are things that Bluesky and Mastodon can do that WordLand can't. But there are also many many things we can do with the structure that WordLand creates that the others can't touch. There's a simple reason for that, if implementing something, no matter how attractive, without limiting the web-ness of the system, we didn't do it. This is the social network of the web. That means all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/753804.Small_Pieces_Loosely_Joined&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; connect with each other in fantastic unforeseeable ways. And anyone can discover these connections. That was the joy of the early web, the thought &quot;Hey I think I can do that&quot; and when you try, it works! We're back there again, if the people come. The technical challenge is still there but now is smaller. Getting people to look and fall in love (hopefully) is the big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After WordLand 0.8 is ready, real soon now, who knows what's next? That's the glory a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/05/boostrappingADecentralized.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. Every step tells you where to go next. That's how you know you're hitting a target.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if Matt will be there for my demo, I hope he is. He and Automattic and the community have created a fantastic platform. Finding WordPress has a super powerful API that I didn't know about is like finding a new web. Let me know if you see it too. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So thanks Matt for your great contribution. I hope to be able to thank you for that personally in Ottawa next week. Perfect timing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cross-posted from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/the-social-network-of-the-web/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Canada&lt;/a&gt; site. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I stop reading every piece that begins by wondering if the Dems or Repubs are &quot;winning&quot; the shutdown. Anything the Dems can do that has anything to do with governing is a win for all of us, including the Repubs, but esp the Dems. This is a new world, the old one is gone. Every day is a new reality.</description>

			<description>Fellow humans. If we're competing with AI, and to some extent it seems we are, consider that they have much better writing tools than we do. If we are to put up some kind of resistance to our cyber-domination, shouldn't we invest in better writing tools for bodied-intellects like us?</description>

			<description>The big deal with WordPress, as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;Think Different piece&lt;/a&gt; is that the strong API makes WP into something quite different from what most people think it is. I think of it as an OS for writing on the web. Very analogous to what we use(d) PCs and Macs for before networks were everywhere. This came up in a thread on Bluesky about MicroPub which appears to be a redo of Metaweblog, with better identity system.</description>

			<description>Try as hard as I can I still have distinct flows and more than one place where I edit. I think that's a consequence of working on WordLand. I have to use it for serious writing, otherwise how would I know if it works. Maybe I can find a way to merge flows, but not at the moment. I still have to do some copy/pasting.</description>

			<title>The antidote to Bigco dominance</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shellen.com/2025/10/07/layover-over/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Jason Shellen, tech entrepreneur, formerly with Blogger and Google. Here’s my perspective on part of the story he tells about RSS and Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Netscape gave us RSS 0.91 and it was good enough to create a new powerful layer on the web. Then Netscape blew up and a bunch of repeated efforts to kill it from big companies. I’ll leave it to others to say why, but they tried over and over to extinguish the spark. Independent developers were stubborn, we kept using the original format, and in the end the independents prevailed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Don’t ever think bigco’s are the answer. They almost always suck the life out of open systems. If you have something good going: &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt;. It’s the antidote to bigco dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you suck up to the bigco thinking they’ll let you in, maybe they will for a short while. But what you’ll be left with may not be worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And just because you have a job at a bigco doesn’t make you hot shit. Maybe for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This theory has a name, it’s described in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma&quot;&gt;Prisoner’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;, and its lesson applies in tech and in the political disaster the US has become.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Reason #29812 you know our current writing system is broken. When you want to post something that has more than the maximum characters they post an image instead of the text. I once wasted a few months making a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=pngwriter&quot;&gt;writing tool&lt;/a&gt; for those kinds of posts, hoping that if it caught on we could have a shadow network that moved the actual text around the net between users.</description>

			<title>Before we were so rudely interrupted</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Before%20we%20were%20so%20rudely%20interrupted%22&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; this phrase a few times recently: &quot;Before we were so rudely interrupted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or, &quot;the big interruption.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Twitter&quot;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, when web writing was downgraded, to be 140 characters with no styling, no links, without the ability to edit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's when writing on the web started going in the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when I say it again I may link to this post, because out here on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/scripting/manila/bloggerCon/ruleoflinks.html&quot;&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt; is always allowed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I was surprised the one I liked best was the VW. It handled well, the others were sloppy, drive like the big cars they are. The Rivian had the best computer system, looked even nicer at first look than the Tesla. The Kia EV9 had a standard Kia computer system, far behind that of Rivian or Tesla. VW's computer was halfway between, it appeared they thought overall about the controls, but I was so impressed by the ride, and size, and the whole concept of it, and I always liked vans. I'm seriously thinking about swapping my Tesla for the VW. There are other disadvantages, I'm going to start reading up on it, until today I never gave it any thought, didn't think it would be a car for me. But I &lt;i&gt;realllly&lt;/i&gt; liked it.</description>
