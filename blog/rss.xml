			<title>Health is nothing to screw with</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since I'm about to turn 70 (next May), and because my body is getting old in ways it never has before (of course) -- I've become a more active participant in the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned is it can be hard to get the attention of the doctors. And once you see your GP about a problem it's almost certain they're going to send you to a specialist. So you go to the specialist and it's pretty random as to whether they put the effort into understanding your situation in full. And they aren't trying to solve all your problems, just the ones they deal in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, a couple of years ago I had a condition that ChatGPT diagnosed in a second but it took the doctors who weren't paying much attention (my primary care doctor had retired and I was being shuffled between NPs and MDs until they could find someone to be my new main doctor) so they were all sending me to the wrong specialists, all of whom said there was no problem, yet I still had the symptoms which were getting worse. On the fourth try, someone sent me to the right specialist and they instantly diagnosed what ChatGPT had diagnosed at the outset. So when people say AI could hurt medical care, I don't think so, it would probably be a good idea to have an AI looking over their shoulders and asking if they've considered the Occam's Razor specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you have to be alert, and push to get them to pay attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And communicating with the system is ridiculous. Almost everything has to be done over the phone. They have email, but if you want to set up an appointment, you have to call. And wait on hold. And wait and wait. And then it's a dice roll as to who you get connected to. There are some people you talk to who seem to be trying to be annoying. It's a total pain in the ass, but you have to do it. (And since they have to ask for your birthdate to identify you they know how old you are and treat you accordingly.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the health care for a person my age seems to be directed at finding the thing that's going to kill you and treating it. That's good, and that's a shift in perspective from someone who until recently had a young body which basically took care of itself. Or so it seemed (I did have emergency heart surgery at 47 that saved my life, although that's a fairly distant memory now).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So right now I have a thing that needs to be looked into because it might be one of those serious things. And it's really hard to get the system to respond quickly, because if it's serious it's one of those things that you want to deal with asap. I don't think it is, but you have to act as if it might be. And it can be humiliating to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's no law saying the doctor, or any of the others in the system, could go to jail or lose their license if they treat any illness I might have. I can now for the first time really understand what it might be like to have to deal with that in addition to all the other &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt; stuff you have to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the point of this post. Throwing a wrench into the already broken wheels of our medical system is the crime. They should go to prison for doing this, the six Supreme Court justices and other Republican assholes who stick their noses where they don't belong. There should be a penalty for what they're doing, they should have the fear they're putting women through. They should worry about what happens when their decision is overturned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they should lose their medical care as should all the members of their families. Then they might get an idea of how sinful they have been.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first draft of this post appeared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02emJvNBVscbSVgUsRaxg6tCWPYcZnfsJy7W2Tp6WU6iKfNtLVgKU8Nh69z8vmkGf8l&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of a new server app that combines the functionality of several apps I used to run as separate servers. The goal is to be able to integrate the functionality of all the components. It's time to invest in blogging in a real way. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017 corner-turn&lt;/a&gt; was about getting back to the foundation I had before trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no longer high value targets for interop. So while I wasted a lot of time trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/08/152655.html&quot;&gt;peer&lt;/a&gt; with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup while developed &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and in doing so learned how to do scalable server apps with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;. I've wasted so much time trying to be compatible with apps that didn't want us. I have a feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let's get back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;Open Web&lt;/a&gt;, which gave us much hope before. I think we can do a lot with feeds and &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. They're to open systems what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt; is to open source. You don't get to be half-committed to being open, you have to be all-in or you can't play. (Same idea as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+podcasting&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, which of course is just an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.) You don't have to deal with a lot of confusion to find the interop. You just have to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post and look what it has become.</description>

			<description>Has anyone attempted to make a higher level language on top of SQL? It's taken me a few iterations over years to finally (I hope) figure out how to design a table to take advantage of the features that evolved into making SQL efficient for the applications people really deploy. If this were machine language, it would be time to start thinking about the HLL that it inspires. Actually long past time imho.</description>

			<description>My Pixel 9 Pro keeps giving me tips on using it when I bring it up, as I'm trying to read an important message, or change something at a red light. I'm always distracted when I use the phone, and by adding more distractions to sell me on something, that's not their right. I paid $1300 for this new phone. And also I can't figure out how to get the phone to ring when I get a call. I keep missing important calls.</description>

			<description>Note to self: When the phone doesn't ring, go to Settings - Sound &amp; vibration - Do Not Disturb. It was on for some reason. I'm sure I didn't set this. I'm pretty sure I've been here before. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/66eda2dd-b8a4-8012-91b3-849a70920a38&quot;&gt;ChatGPT log&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/20/donotdisturb.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I keep discovering uses for ChatGPT. I think it would be very useful to learn a language, for example. I know how to say this in English, could you explain to me, in English, how to say it in French. I bet it's very good at that. I am using it to learn to write SQL code that takes advantage of all the arcane features they've added over the years to handle cases that come up in real database work. It's anything but a new language, and efficiency is everything -- so I think they pretty much have all the cases covered. I remember how frustrating it was to learn Algol when all I knew before that was Fortran and Basic. It would have been great to have ChatGPT to coach me on it.</description>

			<title>Driving on a mountain road</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/06/03/tinaTheBearNurseFromBojackHorseman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was driving on a mountain road yesterday to pick up a pizza in a nearby town. I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so I drive at the speed limit or a little above. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates, getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road, deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never hit an animal, but I have come close.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to pass on this road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been in the other driver's place when a tourist is driving 30 in a 45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don't freak out. It's perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their horn. I slow down more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking okay they'll pass me now, and I'll get a chance to see who this asshole is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we come to the next stop sign, it's the end of the road and you can go left or right. I'm going right, they're going left, and the road is wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last kind of person I would expect to make such a scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I don't speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn't in any kind of a hurry. It's not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when I slow down and add a few car lengths between us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these stories. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to &quot;just happen&quot; organically.</description>

			<title>How I cross-post to Threads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;The RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; is doing a lot of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links from the RSS feed show up on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;give&lt;/a&gt; it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; of the linkblogging feed, and then click on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png&quot;&gt;Add Threads&lt;/a&gt; -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/account/feeds&quot;&gt;Feeds page&lt;/a&gt; is where you set it up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was recruited to speak at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti&quot;&gt;Ria Novosti&lt;/a&gt; conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn't, seemed like a fair deal. Something about it didn't smell right though, so I stayed home.</description>

			<description>If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had, where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for retaining practices that work.

			<title>Ignore polls</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want a better idea of how it's going, look at where the ad dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And make sure all your friends know that you're voting and who you're voting for.

			<description>Could we agree that ChatGPT can ingest everything that's in Wikipedia? I particularly want the images. I'd like to ask for a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry&quot;&gt;Chuck Berry&lt;/a&gt;, and get something nice and be able to put him in a scene with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wordle+kitty%22&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I'm searching for some common ground between the twitter-like systems, a basis for interop, a common API even. We had that for the blogging layer of this onion, something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;.  All the popular blogging software supported it. And that meant you could write once and publish to many places. And you could write the script that did that in an afternoon or two.

			<description>I keep seeing mention of &quot;Podcast 2.0&quot; in various places. That is unusually greedy, even for the tech industry. What next? Deprecating the way podcasting has worked for the last 20 years? How do we know the people doing this aren't shilling for Spotify, Google or Amazon? Please don't mess with something that works as well as podcasting. You want to do something better, great -- make your own name and get people to respect it. Stealing respect from podcasting tells me you have no honor or self-respect, and it should say the same to everyone else. Something else that tells you it's bad, they never bothered to send me an email. Welcome to the tech industry.</description>

			<description>Just watched a Harris rally in Charlotte NC. She's using what Trump said in the debate in her new campaign speech. Brilliant. Getting him on the record in that context is a gift. 60 million viewers. Up till then he only took interviews where he could bully his way past the interviewer.</description>

I keep writing, hoping I see a way to get into the global conversation, again. I remember what it's like. But I'm not done. We still have a big problem to solve in our political and communication system. Online software is where it's at.</description>

			<title>Dropbox almost reinvented the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/113125134990424609&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; to Miguel de Icaza, a longtime developer friend, how Dropbox was within inches of making the web a million times more useful, ten years ago, and then backed away from it. I don't think I've ever told the story here on my blog, so here goes. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Dropbox had a developer program, you could write an app, and register it with them, and then the user could run your app from a website, and log on to Dropbox in the app, and they would have access to files in a directory in the user's Dropbox hierarchy in the app, as if it were accessing it from the local file system, which in a way they were.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made an &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; for that system, and loved it -- it was great, I didn't have to get into the business of reselling storage, or user identity. And for the users, it &quot;just worked&quot; as they say, because they were already using Dropbox, and now it could be used for something completely new and incredibly useful, and it didn't require huge venture capital to get it going, so it would enable very small niche products to find a market. It was brilliant and visionary, and I was very open about my feelings on my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also had a Public Folder, where any user files could be accessed over the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were within an inch of the perfect system. The problem was my app couldn't access user files in any other directory. So it didn't allow for specialization in products, every editor had to do everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had an option where you could give an app access to &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; but that was ridiculous, I couldn't recommend users do that. Users store all kinds of private data on Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/fargo/dropbox.html&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; for the product and how it connects to Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They lost interest in this, btw -- and when they broke the API, I took that opportunity to shut down the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish they had gone in that direction, or someone would go in that direction. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wouldn't have traded places with Harris for anything in the world, she did fantastic. The pressure on her was enormous. I don't think Trump said one thing that was true. And Harris made the point that the division is coming from that guy over there, and if we don't want it all we have to do is turn the freaking page. For once the power is with the people. The Repubs in the Senate wouldn't vote to convict, the Supreme Court just gave him immunity, but the American people, in a few weeks, can tell them all to fuck off.</description>

			<title>A slip of the tongue?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It would have been cool if Harris had said &quot;He's going to have you for dinner&quot; instead of &quot;He's going to eat you for lunch,&quot; which is what she said Putin would do to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Makes you wonder if that was a slip of the tongue or if it was a little Easter Egg she dropped for our later amusement. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/drummer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;What Harris is doing is marketing. It takes a lot of impressions to get people to believe she can be president. If she wants to win, she has to do a lot of interviews and rallies and say quotable things, and be tweeting all the time, not just in the campaign snark accounts (which are great) but also seriously in her own name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People aren't going to care about the policies though they will say that's what they want more of. What they want to feel is that she is present. Biden was invisible that's why they didn't like or trust him, even though he is a good president. Trump is very present, and they like that, trust that, but most of them also know he's a creep. She just has to keep beating the drum. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the secret is to keep beating the drum, constantly, after she wins. Don't disappear like Obama did. She must not only be president of the United States, but she has to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentKamala.html&quot;&gt;president of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; too (and by Twitter I mean all the twitter-like systems). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So don't expect undecided voters to all convert to Harris in one event. But they will if she stays in the news, even dominates the news (please) and help them see Trump as a thing of the past. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the way to win, and to win in governing too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
