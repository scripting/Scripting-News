It doesn't understand the big picture, and if you try to explain it, it probably isn't getting it, and if it does, it will forget it quickly. It's basically fairly stupid, but a way better search engine than Google. Also, it never says it doesn't have enough info to answer the question and then an hour later you figure out the answer it gave you just doesn't work. I still think it's an incredibly useful too, just not as great as I used to think. In a couple of years it has never asked for more information before it answers. That's a clue.</description>

Please don't judge the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/01/15/143544.html&quot;&gt;new search feature&lt;/a&gt;, it was caught up in this outage. Oy.</description>

			<description>Now that I have a search engine for my blog, I can reliably look for all instances of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt; which was a character I was playing around with last year with ChatGPT. It even comes out in reverse chronologic order, and it's better than Google which ignores a lot of my blog these days. My own search engine doesn't do that of course.</description>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse.org&lt;/a&gt;. I pushed a link to it yesterday, and got back this possibly snarky response, but still thought provoking. Why isn't there a feed for the feediverse.org page. Good point! So if you were to put a feed on the home page of the open feediverse, what it be? A feed of posts to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Little Feed Reader&lt;/a&gt; account on Bluesky. I think that might be it. We can celebrate the day when that feed is mirrored on Bluesky (Inbound RSS ftw!) and we can shut down the stupid app that does the bridging. We had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; long before Bluesky came along, isn't it wrong for them to try to force everyone to use their reinvention? It doesn't say anything good about the people who made that choice, among interop-minded developers. It kind of violates our ethos imho.</description>

			<title>An internet of ideas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use one of Twitter's successors.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d&quot;&gt;Here's one&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We should be able to tweet from within any application that has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little text boxes.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d&quot;&gt;And another&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted in there being room for only very simple ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before. Oy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silo&lt;/a&gt;? I don't want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly what we're talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo. But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such thing. If you're federated that means you peer with your competitors. Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg's company these days, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/&quot;&gt;cut off&lt;/a&gt; an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might also want to hook into flow from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.org/&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;. I never believed in their support of the fediverse. Now let's get some reality into these discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x&quot;&gt;On Unix&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that works like that. I hope I have, to some extent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the tech world. Who could've seen that coming? Not me. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x&quot;&gt;Radical idea&lt;/a&gt;. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I.&quot; I don't like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used to say stuff like that about me. It's a substitute for trying to understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned about creating open technology is you attract people who don't contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it's crazy. If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just trust the universe. But giving people orders, there's no place for that. Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent that we can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If you want a clue, listen to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; from January 8, and then if you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316&quot;&gt;ask them here&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd. I also don't believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy&quot;&gt;Tooth Fairy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Glinda&lt;/a&gt; the good witch of the south. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/&quot;&gt;half of the report&lt;/a&gt; on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;enough followers&lt;/a&gt; to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up. It's very hard to get away from companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What I want and am not getting from AI technology</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two very different approaches to the same technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Is Bluesky federated like Masto?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the dialogs you encounter when getting started with Bluesky. It's easy to see how new users might be led believe that Bluesky is federated, as Mastodon is. I'm a developer and I was confused by what it was saying.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/12/isBlueskyFederated.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Is Bluesky is federated?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I'm glad to get to answer these questions. There's more to wpIdentity than is obvious at first glance, for example it has a relatively complete storage system built in for developers to use.

			<title>GitHub and chatbots</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We need an AI chatbot that can work with GitHub repos. That is, in my prompt I say, the following questions are about this GitHub repo. At that point it is ready to answer any question about the project. This an incredibly important intersection of capabilities. As far as I can tell, GitHub doesn't offer it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating that people will suggest I use their editor, I don't want to use their freaking editor. This keeps coming up everywhere. You can't use this or that unless you use their editor. Insidious form of lock-in. And it also limits their market to people who use their editor. Shortsighted and stupid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to start thinking about choice. If it applies to developers, it's more likely they will follow through in the designs of their own projects and give their users choice as a matter of principle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to use a chatbot that incorporates the philosophy of the open web. They have opinions btw. One of the first things Claude.ai does when I give it some JavaScript code is that they &quot;modernize&quot; it. That is also insidious. I choose which constructs I use carefully, and follow the rule that one way to do something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bots can be bullies because the companies that make them are tech companies and thus shortcuts to make money, and thus handicap their users. Maybe the users are starting to figure this out. One can hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's all about WordPress, a product that you won't read much about on this blog, going back through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't paying attention until 2023 when I began to see what an amazing product it is, not just for 2004 when it came out, but in 2024. My theory is that it's the basis for an incredible social web platform, much better than Threads, Mastodon, Bluesky and of course Twitter. That's what I'm talking about for 1/2 hour in this podcast. If you give me that much time, I'll change the way you see the world, or at least the way you see me. I think I'm right about this, with another layer on top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of WordPress. The fact that they aren't gives a clue as to how portable your work is there, and how little choice you get in writing tools. Anyway, please make the time to listen. This is pivotal, and I don't think I'll ever be able to spell it out in writing, it's pure storytelling. Thanks!</description>

			<description>Just found an exponential memory leak at the database level in Bingeworthy. I have never seen one of these in all my years of programming. A data structure that saves a copy of itself in itself. So every time it saved it became exponentially bigger. Until it made the SQL server crash because the JSON object it was storying was over the limit of JSON objects. Crashed the freaking server. Fixed. Feels good.</description>

			<description>As part of the conversion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, I started the database from scratch, but before I did that, I exported &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/tree/master/data&quot;&gt;all the data&lt;/a&gt; and put it in a GitHub repo. This included a JSON file of ratings for each user. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/users/davewiner.json&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my file. Remember we used Twitter identity then, &lt;i&gt;davewiner&lt;/i&gt; is my Twitter username, just replace my name with yours to see your file, if you were a Bingeworthy user in the past.</description>

			<description>I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing with ten years ago. And they could have removed features from the language instead of piling on more and more random reinventions. End of editorial, now on with the new Bingeworthy.</description>

			<title>The new Bingeworthy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while watching a basketball game, checking my iPad, and all of a sudden new items started appearing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;the new Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought oh geez there's some kind of bug, last thing I need now, but quickly realized &lt;i&gt;someone was using it&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;it was working. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were some final mostly cosmetic things I wanted to deal with first, and I wanted to fix up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/bingeworthy/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, such as they are, but I am spread too thin, and had been putting it off. But here was a reminder, I put all that effort to rebuilding it after the TwitterPocalypse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; is the app I missed the most that hadn't been ported off Twitter identity. So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you're getting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I started fresh, with no programs, no users and no ratings. Then I imported the programs that I had rated, and my ratings for them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The most important features are there, although they don't necessarily look that great. I want to do some more work there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you have any questions or problems, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/315&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on the Mac in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo. There's a slight typo, but rather than fix it, I left it there as something for attentive fans to find. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/07/bingeworthyLogoForScriptingNews.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The all-new logo for Bingeworthy, via ChatGPT of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started. I've yet to use a ChatGPT-like service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for writing this kind of book.

			<title>Gambling, sports, kids</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman writes&lt;/a&gt; about social media is poisoning children's minds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like that Krugman has resumed his blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that sometimes I agree or disagree, or have mixed opinions, but I always learn something. That's what makes a blogger good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I agree that children's minds are being poisoned. But I am pretty sure when people like Krugman and myself reach a certain age, and we are the same age, we start looking at new media that way. Maybe &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; minds are poisoned. My father called television the &quot;idiot box.&quot; But it eventually became the literature of my generation, often very good. But maybe laws can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the NFL, MLB and tennis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And is this why they can now afford to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-agrees-to-contract-with-mets&quot;&gt;sign players&lt;/a&gt; to $765 million contracts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're all getting hugely rich, but I believe that they are certainly doing great harm to the new sports fans growing up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a math major and a 50+ year programmer, and I know that if you gamble enough you lose all your money. And as an addiction no gambler ever gets up from the table to enjoy their winnings when they win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in WordLand on New Years Day, saving it for a good moment on Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now." created="Sat, 04 Jan 2025 01:50:41 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a015041"/>

				<source:outline text="I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports." created="Sat, 04 Jan 2025 02:47:29 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/01/03/014548.html#a024729"/>
