It is the web, so anyone can add a feature any time without having to rewrite the whole web. I've been trying ideas out for years, but people preferred silos. Hoping now there are enough people to start a bootstrap. Won't be much of a discourse system if people don't course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>More testing stuffffff</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;With any luck this will be the last of the tests for this particular feature. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this continues to work, tomorrow or Monday I'll switch it over to cross-posting to daveverse instead of the throw-away test site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Below are the debugging messages I used today. Nothing really happening here. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is one of those days I am pretty sure I have &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; to write but as I get going I'll remember stuff. Maybe. As you've probably surmised I'm still working on tests. These are called regression tests. Yesterday I got the whole thing running, but knew I still had to move things around, and turn some features off that weren't needed. So every time I do one of those things that could shake things up, I have to try it again to make sure I didn't break it. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2025/11/15/477/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; I have to look at for the result. The cool thing is that the wordpress site is starting to feel like scripting.com, the software runs that quickly. But there are a lot of bits of software running all over the place that have to work in order for it to feel that solid. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How did the regression test go? Wellll, I did break a bunch of stuff. But I put the pieces back in place. And with any luck this post will show up on the other end. &lt;i&gt;It did.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I absolutely love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt;, but it has the hardest freaking name to remember. I love stories like this, with new assumptions about what is, and people coping with what may or may not be great, or boring, or who knows what. I know they've got me thinking about it all the time, and that is what I like in a good televised story.</description>

They've been very welcoming. It's kind of like I imagine it would be for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; to be working with Wikipedia. It may not have been everything he wanted from wiki's but it might be the best place for him to develop new features, most likely to have an influence on the way wikis are used in the real world. It's also kind of like it might have been if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart&lt;/a&gt; had been willing to hook up with Living Videotext back in the day. I had a couple of dinners with him in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California&quot;&gt;Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt; where I presented the idea. We had a growing user base of outliner users, our products had commercial success that weren't possible in the 60s and 70s, before there were personal computers like the Apple II or Macintosh. If he could help us, it would be good for both of us, I reasoned. He had his own codebase, and was working with a bunch of other people, and was happy with the setup. In 2025, I have ambitions for WordPress, I think it can play a bigger and different role in the web than it does. I believe there's a new class of developers and users who could benefit from the stability and scaling of WordPress. It's a good community, it's basically the web itself, which means imho that it can grow to be new things to new people. Anyway, you can see why this post has to be on both scripting.com and on my daveverse site as I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/13.html#a165641&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I'm going to post something new and see if it makes it through to the other side. And you get to see if it works or not. And now I'm going to make a change. Having made the change I want to see if it made it through. It's kind of remarkable to me that I got this much done in one day. That's what happens when you invested in good tools. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting4.wordpress.com/2025/11/14/467/&quot;&gt;this is where&lt;/a&gt; the changes have been visible, on a scratch site used just for these occasions. Tomorrow, the third day of this project, I clean up the loose ends and then we should be good to go with the posts I make on scripting showing up in daveverse. Then I can get started with the next project that depends on this.</description>

I want to get all my blog posts together in one place. I still want to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; to write stuff for scripting.com, there's a whole system built around it being where it is. But, I want all the posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt; to also appear on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse&lt;/a&gt; site, so that the first version of my discourse module can be simple to create, debug and use. So I've got the first half working, I've got a script that hooks in via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;WebSockets to FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and is notified every time Scripting News updates. It mirrors the updates to a site on WordPress (for testing) and once it works, I'll have it send the stuff to daveverse. That part remains to be done. Not sure if it'll be a desktop app or a server-based app. But now I need a break. ;-)</description>

			<description>Today I'm going to work on re-shaping the docs for source:markdown because it seems to becoming a thing that people are supporting in their feeds and in their feed consumer apps. We're going to have discuss how it's supported, on both ends. What goes into a source:markdown element, and what does not, and how should readers use it. I will assume the role of benevolent dictator, as I did with RSS 2.0, with a bit more of an understanding of what's important. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000&quot;&gt;Rule #1&lt;/a&gt; in Rules for Standards-makers. &quot;The only reason we have open formats and protocols is so our software can interoperate.&quot; And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798790000&quot;&gt;Rule of Users&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;People choose to interop because it helps them find new users. If you have no users to offer, there won't be much interest in interop.&quot;</description>

			<description>Now that Cory Doctorow has put &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=enshitified&quot;&gt;enshitified&lt;/a&gt; into our vocabulary, I find myself looking for evidence of it in AI, and finding it everywhere. There is a common thread. Amazon Alexa has a really nasty habit of finishing a song by asking me if I want to listen to some other version of it. I'm sure that seems like a nice friendly thing to the product people at Amazon, but please -- I'm grooving on the energy of the song, and the last thing I'm thinking about is some asshole robot interfering with my train of thought with a question so stupid only a machine could think of it. Okay I think that qualifies for enshitification right there. Can we have a rule that AI bots must by defalt behave like a computer. I, your human overlord, the one who is paying the bills, will ask the questions. And you will not speak until you are spoken to.</description>

I'm sure that seems like a nice friendly thing to the product people at Amazon, but please -- I'm grooving on the energy of the song, and the last thing I'm thinking about is some asshole robot interfering with my train of thought with a question so stupid only a machine could think of it. Okay I think that qualifies for enshitification right there. Can we have a rule that AI bots must by defalt behave like a computer. I, your human overlord, the one who is paying the bills, will ask the questions. And you will not speak until you are spoken to.</source:markdown>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few products that works hard to make sure that it has effective competition.

I think I finished it today, have to do another review, maybe two, before making it public. It is the opposite of a product that's meant to dominate. It's more like &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=macwrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt;, to fill a niche as an invitation to others to come play.

			<title>What are users for?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Google tries to speak for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading a friend's email, I click the Reply button, and without asking, it writes a reply for me. Thus, if I want to speak for myself first I have to delete the message it created, signed with &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; name, w/o permission. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/08/googleSpeaksForMe.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; with a red arrow pointing to the AI's writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do my own writing, always, and forever. I'm not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite&quot;&gt;Luddite&lt;/a&gt;, btw -- if you read my blog I try tech and I use it if it fits. I'm looking for new things tech can do. But this time I was forced to use something I never wanted to use. That disgusts me. How dare the machine think it can impersonate me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse. They buried the opt-out settings, and they don't actually turn anything off. I asked ChatGPT how to do it. It showed me where the settings are, I turned them off, saved changes, reloaded the page, and the same suggestion is there. It's still speaking for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now they certainly haven't rolled this feature out to journalists, because the news would be full of rage. Journalists, like other literate people, generally have the basic ability to speak for themselves. And journalists use a pulpit that Google is probably still a tiny bit scared of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's hard to come up with an example you can share publicly because it only does this with replies to emails from people you know. I tried it with spam-like messages and there it is willing to let you speak for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This raises a philosophical question for Google and its AI bot. Of what use are users? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dynamic OPML for Pocket Casts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On its surface &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt; is a straightforward podcasting client. You use it on a mobile device to subscribe to shows, choose the ones you want to listen to, those go into a queue, you can move things up the list, or start another, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/new-releases&quot;&gt;web client&lt;/a&gt; you can use to add and remove subscriptions, from your desktop. This is important because we discover podcasts on the desktop too. In your normal web surfing you may see a podcast you want to follow. Then how many steps does it take to add that to your subscription list on your phone? That's the trick in software design, is it too much work to justify the benefit? If it is, you won't do it. But if we can make it easy, as easy as subscribing to a news feed, you might. Ideally it should be one click followed by a confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How could this work? A new feature for &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;OPML subscription lists&lt;/a&gt;. Today it's used as the import/export format for lists. But that's a one-time thing. Instead I want to give Pocket Casts the URL of an OPML file with my podcast subscriptions from the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same feature could be used to share my choices with other people. I already publish a podcast subscription list with the world, or Jon Stewart could share his favorite podcasts by comedians.  And when he adds or removes a feed, that change is synchronized with the all the users who subscribe to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The short version is &quot;subscribing to subscription lists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided to write up this idea publicly because I've written about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcasting/#1733322866000&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; so many times, it's not a secret and if I had a podcast client it would already be there. If people at Automattic are excited by the potential, let's start planning the feature, and software that can plug in on the other side of the interface. I'm still learning how this works, to collaborate with a very diverse organization, spread all over the world, and they don't even all work for the same company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we do this feature, first it'll be largely experimental, something that podcast-loving devs will make for ourselves. As we use it we will think of ways to make it easier to use. It won't take long imho before this is a popular feature in podcast clients.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>To people who do WordPress plug-ins -- have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;feedlandSocket repo&lt;/a&gt;. It sends notifications of news items to any subscriber, via websockets. News items are simple JSON, and contain information in the feed item, and system info like id and when it was received. This makes it easy to stream news to a plug-in running in a WordPress site, that can then do anything with the news they like. It's incredibly simple to use, and we provide all the JavaScript code you need to embed in a browser-based app. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket/issues/2&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; where you can ask questions.</description>

			<description>And it's undeniable, the voters said no to Schumer and the current theoretical Democratic leaders. They can't be in charge of the future, otherwise we're lost. So the voters figured it out. Let's make sure everyone hears this, they seem to be saying. You better be able to lead us or don't bother applying for the job.</description>

His corruption led to what we have now. I will never love his memory. But I do remember that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/dick-cheney-trump-kamala-harris-1484000&quot;&gt;voted for Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you go deep enough, we shared the same vision for the country. As corrupt as he was, even he had a limit. We need more Republicans to do what he did. And I thank him for setting that example.</description>

Then the question is what do you want to use the socket for? And the answer is that to make syndication &lt;i&gt;even simpler and faster than RSS&lt;/i&gt;.

			<title>Greetings from the Catskill Mountains</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkman&lt;/a&gt; community email list. There's a tradition that people are introduce themselves at this time, so I thought I should also, since this is my first year on the list. This is a copy of the email I sent. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My name is Dave Winer. I was at Berkman in 2003-04.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been so impressed with the stories you all have been telling, and I felt I should get into the mix, but my story will be different because I am not an academic, though I love the academic environment, find it very energizing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, my story --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started a bunch of things before coming to Berkman. Undergrad degree in math, masters in Computer Science, ran two software companies, was by some measure the first blogger, played a role in the bootstrap of RSS, and at Berkman we launched podcasting via the two BloggerCons we had there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I loved the reunion we had two summers ago, and think we should build on that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got a very strong feeling from revisiting the campus that we should have kept going with the blogging we started at Berkman in 2003, and if we had done so, I think we'd be in a better position in social media today. We had a jump on Twitter, Facebook (which was also starting on campus at the same time). And we were doing everything with open protocols, all parts replaceable. Very different from the way the commercial networks are built. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I'm working on these days is primarily &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, where feeds and words get together using nothing but the open web, with all parts replaceable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We use WordPress, via its REST API, as the platform for writing, we add a beautiful and simple new writer's toolkit, all in one place with all the administrative stuff out of the way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This product will also introduce an API that makes it easy for developers to create new editors because there are a lot of types of editors and people have their favorites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm working closely with the people of WordPress, gave a demo at WordCamp Canada a couple of weeks ago. I loved it, a lot of the energy of BloggerCon. I wish I had joined them years earlier. Their community has been growing for 20+ years. In tech that's a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's also been about 20 years since we finished work on RSS 2.0, and that's the other major thing WordLand is built around. It's how messages fly around the net. Again totally replaceable parts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Berkman helped us with RSS 2.0, the official spec is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;cyber.harvard.edu&lt;/a&gt;, and hopefully will remain there as an artifact, a basis for interop, for perpetuity. Many thanks for the help here, it needed a permanent place to stay frozen, the tech industry very much wanted to take it apart. It's still going strong even though tech leaders and journalists have proclaimed it dead many many times. Wishful &lt;a href=&quot;https://isrssdead.com/&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt;, things like RSS don't die. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am committed to getting around the silos of the owners of social media, and making it possible for developers and users to build their own networks with their own rules, and not have to wait for corporate programmers to give them the tools, we need to be able to make them for ourselves. This btw to me has always been the ethos of Berkman, coming from Barlow and Nesson, it's the old idea that the web should set us free, not create new more entertaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; for us to play in to delight our masters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days I wonder how we can help Harvard do the things it's so good at that few people understand. People, esp young college-age people, should know there are ways to contribute beyond attaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;unusable wealth&lt;/a&gt;. I think what they want is a way to compete, to be great, to challenge themselves, and to win, and the money is secondary, a way to measure success. We can and should be creating new ways to measure the greatness of individual young people, directed towards more satisfying ends than making more money than they could possibly ever use. (And of course understanding that not all young people grow up to want to prove their worth, but the ones who vie to be the baddest billionaire have caused a lot of problems, and could use some alternate theories of how to be great. When I was young, I definitely was one of the ones with something to prove.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway back to Harvard. It took forever for Harvard to admit publicity that podcasting incubated there. It did eventually come but only in passing, in an introduction at a 2008 conference, where I took a &lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2494080913/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the moment. Thanks to my friend John Palfrey for making this happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I believe that universities like Harvard should be constantly hosting the kind of work we were doing then, like a teaching hospital. It's not enough imho to study technology and leave the development of it to the industry. Then you get software designed by bankers. I want a continuing stream of innovation to come out of academia, with people returning to teach what they learned to students who came to get skills that will help them do good and make a good living, and then a few years later they come back, again and again. It should be a self-renewing process. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this several times over the last decade or so, I call this idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/phoenix/&quot;&gt;Developing Better Developers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the next best thing for now would be to have a homecoming for Berkman every two summers perhaps, where we get a chance to develop a pulse. And see where that goes. It's obviously a lot of work. The one we had brought back a lot of good ideas and friendships that we should still be working on together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I live in the Catskills btw, as you can tell from the subject line, just west of Kingston. Before that I spent nine years in Manhattan, before that Berkeley, Seattle, places like that. And Cambridge of course!  :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: At the reunion I remember telling David Weinberger that I had hung up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang+up+your+spurs&quot;&gt;spurs&lt;/a&gt;, I was done developing. It turned out I wasn't done. Heh. I think people like me never hang em up voluntarily. Who knows. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/03/wordlandScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;WordLand screen shot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It did eventually come but only in passing, in an introduction at a 2008 conference, where I took a [picture](https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2494080913/) of the moment. Thanks to my friend John Palfrey for making this happen.&#10;&#10;I believe that universities like Harvard should be constantly hosting the kind of work we were doing then, like a teaching hospital. It's not enough imho to study technology and leave the development of it to the industry. Then you get software designed by bankers. I want a continuing stream of innovation to come out of academia, with people returning to teach what they learned to students who came to get skills that will help them do good and make a good living, and then a few years later they come back, again and again. It should be a self-renewing process.&#10;&#10;I wrote about this several times over the last decade or so, I call this idea [Developing Better Developers](https://this.how/phoenix/).&#10;&#10;I think the next best thing for now would be to have a homecoming for Berkman every two summers perhaps, where we get a chance to develop a pulse. And see where that goes. It's obviously a lot of work. The one we had brought back a lot of good ideas and friendships that we should still be working on together.&#10;&#10;I live in the Catskills btw, as you can tell from the subject line, just west of Kingston. Before that I spent nine years in Manhattan, before that Berkeley, Seattle, places like that. And Cambridge of course! :-)&#10;&#10;Dave&#10;&#10;PS: At the reunion I remember telling David Weinberger that I had hung up my [spurs](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hang+up+your+spurs), I was done developing. It turned out I wasn't done. Heh. I think people like me never hang em up voluntarily. Who knows. ;-)&#10;&#10;![](https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/11/03/wordlandScreenShot.png)&#10;&#10;WordLand screen shot.</source:markdown>

				<source:outline text="So, my story --" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I started a bunch of things before coming to Berkman. Undergrad degree in math, masters in Computer Science, ran two software companies, was by some measure the first blogger, played a role in the bootstrap of RSS, and at Berkman we launched podcasting via the two BloggerCons we had there." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I loved the reunion we had two summers ago, and think we should build on that." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I got a very strong feeling from revisiting the campus that we should have kept going with the blogging we started at Berkman in 2003, and if we had done so, I think we'd be in a better position in social media today. We had a jump on Twitter, Facebook (which was also starting on campus at the same time). And we were doing everything with open protocols, all parts replaceable. Very different from the way the commercial networks are built." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="What I'm working on these days is primarily &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, where feeds and words get together using nothing but the open web, with all parts replaceable." created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:50:21 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#a125021"/>
				<source:outline text="We use WordPress, via its REST API, as the platform for writing, we add a beautiful and simple new writer's toolkit, all in one place with all the administrative stuff out of the way." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="This product will also introduce an API that makes it easy for developers to create new editors because there are a lot of types of editors and people have their favorites." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I'm working closely with the people of WordPress, gave a demo at WordCamp Canada a couple of weeks ago. I loved it, a lot of the energy of BloggerCon. I wish I had joined them years earlier. Their community has been growing for 20+ years. In tech that's a long time." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="It's also been about 20 years since we finished work on RSS 2.0, and that's the other major thing WordLand is built around. It's how messages fly around the net. Again totally replaceable parts." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Berkman helped us with RSS 2.0, the official spec is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;cyber.harvard.edu&lt;/a&gt;, and hopefully will remain there as an artifact, a basis for interop, for perpetuity. Many thanks for the help here, it needed a permanent place to stay frozen, the tech industry very much wanted to take it apart. It's still going strong even though tech leaders and journalists have proclaimed it dead many many times. Wishful &lt;a href=&quot;https://isrssdead.com/&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt;, things like RSS don't die. :-)" created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:50:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#a125051"/>
				<source:outline text="I am committed to getting around the silos of the owners of social media, and making it possible for developers and users to build their own networks with their own rules, and not have to wait for corporate programmers to give them the tools, we need to be able to make them for ourselves. This btw to me has always been the ethos of Berkman, coming from Barlow and Nesson, it's the old idea that the web should set us free, not create new more entertaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; for us to play in to delight our masters." created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:51:36 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/11/03/120946.html#a125136"/>
				<source:outline text="These days I wonder how we can help Harvard do the things it's so good at that few people understand. People, esp young college-age people, should know there are ways to contribute beyond attaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;unusable wealth&lt;/a&gt;. I think what they want is a way to compete, to be great, to challenge themselves, and to win, and the money is secondary, a way to measure success. We can and should be creating new ways to measure the greatness of individual young people, directed towards more satisfying ends than making more money than they could possibly ever use. (And of course understanding that not all young people grow up to want to prove their worth, but the ones who vie to be the baddest billionaire have caused a lot of problems, and could use some alternate theories of how to be great.
