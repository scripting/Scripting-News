There should be opportunities for independent developers to create for the web without having big tech companies be our gatekeepers. The web is a public resource. Of course big companies will take whatever isn't nailed down. It's way past time to protect the open web.</description>

			<description>Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks&quot;&gt;most powerful political statement&lt;/a&gt; I've ever heard. &quot;Who's going to tell Trump the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs.&quot; The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or another, we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; changed. America in 2024 is vastly different from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my feet are planted in, we realize that there isn't a black America and a white America, there's just one America. We finally have come to accept ourselves as we have been all along.</description>

I would love to hook up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/dwPocketcastSubscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; from PocketCasts to dave.podcatch.com, so that I could add to the website from my freaking phone. Make it really easy for me to pitch a great podcast feed to my friends. But I can only export my feeds, I can't create a dynamic link between the two. If I ran a popular podcatch app like Pocketcasts, I would open up my outbound subscription list, and vie to be the default place people come to subscribe to podcasts. If a few of my users were geeks and visionaries, they could start telling other vendors they should hook up to my source lists, so they can use Pocketcasts to subscribe. One place to subscribe is way better than many. If you think things like that can't happen, think again. How did you all come to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for your subscription lists? It's because someone volunteered to go first, and the users of that product demanded that other products support the format. It still amazes me that there's an interchange format there, but we've barely begun to tap into the power there.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT slows down my programming, and that's good</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/21/iProgramMoreSlowlyNowThanksToChatGPT.m4a&quot;&gt;27 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the recording quality, I was in a large space with bad acoustics. I'll try to remember not to do that in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've noticed I spend less time programming, I go more slowly and carefully because now I can know a lot more about each problem I'm solving, and use the packages I build on, jQuery, MySQL, Node, the browser, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, Frontier, to greater advantage. A new kind of programming is possible, and it's better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I go into some detail in this podcast about how the process works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interested in hearing similar stories from other developers using ChatGPT or something like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ignore the NY Times</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in comparison to the &lt;i&gt;president&lt;/i&gt; who was about to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence next to Harris is almost always awkward. He's taller, and moves a lot. I noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I'm not sure that pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a sugar high.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don't pretend they aren't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment speech about them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To the extent we can, it's time to push them aside. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat over and over, &quot;Ignore the NY Times.&quot; I'm going to paste it in 25 times now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.

There often is a NY Times headline in the image, saying something silly like how prisons are dealing with an influx of convicted house pets (like the kitten). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; the NYT is reporting on how the kitten loves lasagna, and of course how cute she is (it's important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful! Keeping me entertained while we try to get through this election. If I'm forced to accept lies from the NYT, without any voice given to opposition, they might as well be lies that entertain me! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kitty in prison, via Facebook.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wonder if the NYT minds that we think of them as no more straight than Fox News. They've fallen really far, and have so far shown they totally don't care if we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for Living Videotext begins with one of our slogans. It was a joke, and meant to keep us humble, so we listen to users. It was one of many such slogans. LVT made some important contributions to the networks we use today. Wikipedia should talk about that first, show some respect, for crying out loud. Otherwise, except for that snipe up front, the account is actually pretty accurate.</description>

			<description>It's nice to see the DNC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-democratic-national-convention-is-giving-influencers-media-credentials-for-the-first-time-why-both-campaigns-are-pivoting-to-social-first-strategies-110059052.html&quot;&gt;including influencers&lt;/a&gt; this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html&quot;&gt;at the DNC in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Elon bought the airport</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world hub like Atlanta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-london-heathrow-lhr&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; or Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a network of airports, like the ones served by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/cheap-flight-destinations&quot;&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought, but it's not as much of a hub yet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-orlando-mco&quot;&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-frankfurt-fra&quot;&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it's where most of the traffic already goes. It's quite possibly not running that smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction, huge traffic, broken systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/14/weTryHarder.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;When I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel funding for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;LVT&lt;/a&gt;, I asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they're not going away. Companies that large don't disappear. After 40 years of experience in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very rarely disappear. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles#Counterculture_of_the_1960s_and_1970s&quot;&gt;Laurel Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Or who knows? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's a high probability that Musk's company will be the market leader for the forseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reliable app storage over time is not here yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an interesting design challenge either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000 characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what we've settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From a tweet to a long blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server and network technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In every way it'll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to create structures of writing over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that last sentence is the gotcha -- &lt;i&gt;over time. &lt;/i&gt;It's the frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there's no way for me, as an individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month. A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I started an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; writing on GitHub. It's still just a fraction of my writing, I'm not doing anything like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I've managed to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month, which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I guess for the project I'm doing I will again use GitHub to mirror the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for this purpose, or something much better comes along.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for enough time to present the &lt;i&gt;illusion&lt;/i&gt; of persistence. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Feeds for Threads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kvell&quot;&gt;kvelling&lt;/a&gt; the other day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-wOWuDJUU6&quot;&gt;about rss.app&lt;/a&gt; and how they have feeds for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; accounts. They do. But there are two caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.app/pricing&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $9.99 per month for 15 feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people's budgets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The second concern is more serious. It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. This is not right, and it's not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it. There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn't watch reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even though I guess the rest of the world thinks he's big in NY.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German in Queens, but not that rare either.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think this is over are fooled, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/18/inciting-rioters-in-britain-was-a-test-run-for-elon-musk-just-see-what-he-plans-for-america&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in today's Guardian for another perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Heard it just now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/articles/the-makeorbreak-issues-of-the-2024-election&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; after a Republican was using &quot;talking points&quot; that were &quot;misleading.&quot; Of course lies &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; misleading, but they are also lies. What these reporters hope to do (I guess) is convince you that the lies they just broadcast don't reflect poorly on them. If they said &quot;that guy just lied five times&quot; you'd have to wonder why they included it. What's wrong with them. But if they just were &quot;misleading&quot; oh I guess that's okay. Same thing happened in an otherwise pretty honorable &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3yKwJE4&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post. &quot;When not one but multiple rants call 'into question not only his fitness for office but his basic cognitive abilities,' the media’s refusal to convey Trump’s unfitness amounts to misleading the public.&quot; No. It's not just misleading, it's deadly -- to the reputation of the publication that didn't convey what they saw clearly with their own two eyes. The rest of the Rubin piece is worth reading. I expect she softened her criticism because she has to work with the editors at the Post who decided to keep cutting Trump slack. You and I don't have that problem. The news industry in the US must be scrapped and replaced with one that tells the truth, otherwise what's the point.</description>

			<source:outline text="Watch out when reporters say something said on their air or in their pub is &quot;misleading.&quot; What they really mean is someone just lied in their space. Heard it just now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/articles/the-makeorbreak-issues-of-the-2024-election&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; after a Republican was using &quot;talking points&quot; that were &quot;misleading.&quot; Of course lies &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; misleading, but they are also lies. What these reporters hope to do (I guess) is convince you that the lies they just broadcast don't reflect poorly on them. If they said &quot;that guy just lied five times&quot; you'd have to wonder why they included it. What's wrong with them. But if they just were &quot;misleading&quot; oh I guess that's okay. Same thing happened in an otherwise pretty honorable &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3yKwJE4&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post. &quot;When not one but multiple rants call 'into question not only his fitness for office but his basic cognitive abilities,' the media’s refusal to convey Trump’s unfitness amounts to misleading the public.&quot; No. It's not just misleading, it's deadly -- to the reputation of the publication that didn't convey what they saw clearly with their own two eyes. The rest of the Rubin piece is worth reading. I expect she softened her criticism because she has to work with the editors at the Post who decided to keep cutting Trump slack. You and I don't have that problem.

I don't work in the Mastodon world, I'm already committed to the projects I'm doing. But we could really use something nice, designed to plug into blogs. This is a good use-case, and it's pretty close.</description>

Had just listened to an Adam Curry podcast and one from the Gillmor Gang. Played a bit of music, described how a podcatcher would work, pretty close to the way they work today. Shortly after the feature would be in Radio UserLand. It was the only episode I did in August 2004. The next one is on September 1 and there are a total of nine shows in September, including the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt; which is a podcast Adam and I did together.

			<description>The best journalism is coming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq&quot;&gt;from the candidate&lt;/a&gt;. I think you could make a pretty good hour-length show on MSNBC with 12 of their posts, five minutes each, one after the other, with a small panel of pundits quickly snarking about what they just saw. Go have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq&quot;&gt;the feed&lt;/a&gt; and see if you agree. The best thing about it is that the writing is totally blogger-style.</description>

			<title>Musk is just getting started</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a&quot;&gt;11 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see happy talk all over the place that Twitter is done, Musk is killing it, blah blah blah. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. In the next few months Twitter is going to morph into the political system that Barack Obama could have and should have built.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turns out creating a president of the United States is worth a lot of money. Trump is inept at squeezing the money out of it, he's a loudmouth who proved one thing, Twitter is all you needed in 2016 to get elected president. That's going to change, as competition shows up (Zuckerberg, for example, with Threads). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They know, even if you don't -- that it can be very profitable to own the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Trump loses, Musk won't get it on this round, but eventually he will own a big piece of the president, and then he will move his deals with SpaceX and Tesla up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, it's only 11 minutes. You probably haven't considered this angle, but I promise you he's moving, and he's mostly unopposed right now. He's not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nudnik&quot;&gt;nudnick&lt;/a&gt; so many people seem to think he is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Harris makes me proud</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this campaign. Latest innovation, they're going to do at least one public rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration, and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don't want to witness is what the journalists try to provoke. I've been to two DNCs and later heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented crises that simply didn't exist. Who's going to have time to call them out because no one at the convention is watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard on a podcast yesterday that it's weird that Harris is polling as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important&quot;&gt;generic&lt;/a&gt; Democrat, which they felt was odd because she's not a white man, which made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party. Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not interracial and female.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the United States. We're strong, and we win, and when we don't we get back up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we've yet to create the interracial and female version that symbol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it doesn't have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our political system its flirtation with fascism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/14/ladyLibertyFullSizeIowa.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Statue of Liberty in the heartland. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
