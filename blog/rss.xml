It's already far better at delivering the truth than all the reference sources on the web, including news orgs. One of the secrets to success in business, media and politics is to learn how to lead journalists to the story you want them to tell. There's are all kinds of tricks, I know because I succeeded in that world. When I ask ChatGPT to tell me about things that journalism got wrong that I know everything about, it gets it right. I don't know how that works, because what I think are their sources got it wrong. It's freaking amazing. Now I totally agree that the small group of super rich people who control tech are not people I'd like to see run the world, they break things I care about far too often. Too much power for people who can't or won't see outside their tiny shrinking world.</description>

			<description>Someday Google will have a chatbot I can ask if YouTube TV can play Knicks and Mets games live, and if so how much extra does it cost. Navigating their website is hopeless. They must not want you to get that bit of info. They hint at the possibility of it, but I know from previous experience that the reason others do it that way is because they don't actually deliver on what they want you to think they deliver. I guess companies like that are betting that it's just too much trouble to get out of the deal, but the fact is it's incredibly easy to opt out of the deals, unlike with my cable provider, which makes cutting the cord and re-establishing it incredibly time-consuming.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/26/happyThanksgivingEverybody.html&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;: Every so often something happens, a family member or friend dies, and that makes the confusion come front and center. And once in a lifetime someone as close as a father dies, and that floors you. You get knocked down, and as you come back up, you're not the same person you were before. The mystery of life and the question of existence after life, they're always there, but they loom much larger after a loss.</description>

			<title>The Story of FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This story was written entirely by ChatGPT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the digital realm of FeedLand, a world pulsating with streams of information, there existed a unique society where knowledge and news were the sources of power. This world was composed of various domains, each representing different genres of information – from the News Mountains to the Blog Plains, the Podcast Peninsula, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The protagonist of our story is a young, curious girl named Ada. In FeedLand, each individual had a personal Feed – a dynamic stream of information tailored to their interests and needs. Ada, however, was different. She had the rare ability to see and interact with all the Feeds in FeedLand, a talent that was both a gift and a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ada's journey began when she noticed disturbances in the Feeds – information was getting muddled, important news was lost in a sea of trivial updates, and misinformation was spreading like wildfire. This chaos was causing confusion and conflict among the inhabitants of FeedLand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Determined to restore balance, Ada embarked on a quest to find the Core Source, the mythical origin of all Feeds in FeedLand. She believed that by reaching the Core Source, she could rectify the disturbances and bring order back to the information flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ada's adventure took her through diverse territories. In the News Mountains, she navigated through towering peaks of breaking stories and deep valleys of in-depth analyses. In the Blog Plains, she encountered a wide array of opinions and narratives, learning to discern the insightful from the mundane. The Podcast Peninsula challenged her with a cacophony of voices and perspectives, each vying for attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Along her journey, Ada was accompanied by a group of companions, each representing different aspects of FeedLand's information ecosystem. There was Lex, a fact-checker with the uncanny ability to spot inaccuracies in seconds; Echo, a podcaster who could weave stories that captivated anyone who listened; and Pixel, a visual artist who could bring any information to life through graphics and animations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Together, they faced challenges like the Trolls of Misinformation, the Echo Chambers where no new thoughts could penetrate, and the Filter Bubbles that isolated communities from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they reached the Core Source, a vast, glowing nexus of data and information. Ada realized that the Core Source had become overwhelmed with the sheer volume and variety of information being generated. She used her unique ability to untangle the flows, filter out the noise, and establish new, more efficient pathways for information dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Feeds of FeedLand became clearer, more accurate, and more accessible to its inhabitants. Knowledge and news flowed harmoniously, enriching the lives of all who lived there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ada's journey taught her the importance of critical thinking, discernment, and the responsible sharing of information. She continued to explore the ever-evolving landscape of FeedLand, always ensuring that the streams of information remained pure and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her story became a legend in FeedLand, inspiring others to be mindful of the information they consumed and shared, making Ada a symbol of wisdom and guidance in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/23/adaTheYoungHeroOfFeedland.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Ada, the young hero of FeedLand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What I've learned about WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; this morning, APIs and feeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;This last year I’ve caught up with WordPress, have been asking questions, and one of the best thing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/12.html#a142810&quot;&gt;my work with Automattic&lt;/a&gt; is that the doors have been open. I have great teachers who are encouraging me, and of course are experts in and proud of WordPress, and as a result I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; are going to work together in some very nice ways. Getting pretty close on some of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A year ago I didn’t even know that WordPress still had APIs. At some point the code I had that worked with WordPress via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; broke, and I assumed that it was the end of the line, and took the feature out of my linkblogging tool. But I was wrong. And not only that there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/&quot;&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, a modern REST interface, that works in the same model I use for FeedLand and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s all there. I love it. All kinds of integrations will be possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Getting FeedLand to work in the new environment has been a step by step process. It was built to run on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; server, with a file system. I’ve converted now all the pieces we needed, and it seems finally to run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Onward! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT was overloaded earlier this evening. I wrote: &quot;I'm losing my shit here. I feel as lost without it as I would have felt last year without Google. Anyway here's the question I need answered. 'working in javascript in the browser, a question about using localstorage. are there any rules about how much storage you can use? would 10MB be too much? 50MB?'&quot; Believe it or not my friend ChatGPT will have some advice about that and it'll be pretty good. You can't find that through a search engine, btw, which is why OpenAI is so important.</description>

			<description>There's a flaw in the design of our social networks. The idea that there are &quot;conversations&quot; when actually many of the replies you get are spam. People trying to attach their name to something that they hope gets them attention and followers. So when someone addresses something to you it can be confusing, because they aren't actually talking to you, they're talking to the imagined thousands of people over your shoulder looking for some new tweeter or tooter or threader to adore. When it's actually mostly people looking for places to hang their own spam to catch other people's attention and followers. Is there anything actually going on there? Sadly, no.</description>

Sadly, no." created="Wed, 22 Nov 2023 02:45:56 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/11/21.html#a024556"/>

But we limit the vertical space a feed item gets in the timeline, you can see the whole thing by clicking on it, and clicking again after having a look. If you want to create a genuine art feed, then I want to make it look great in FeedLand. And keep the more rude feeds manageable. If you're playing around with artcasting, let me know, I'd like to see how others are doing, and share interesting stuff with people who follow this feed.</description>

But it's the thought that counts. ❤️ &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A creative diagram representing a technology stack as a building with multiple floors. At the bottom floor, label it 'TCP'. The next floor above should be labeled 'HTTP'. Above that, have a larger floor labeled 'RSS', with smaller adjacent floors labeled 'Atom' and 'ActivityPub'. The top two floors should be labeled 'Textcasting' and 'Artcasting' respectively. Surrounding the building, depict human-style animals like dogs, bears, owls, and hamsters, all dressed in business attire. Each of these characters should be holding signs with the names of tech companies like Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Salesforce.com. The diagram should illustrate the hierarchy and importance of each technology layer in the stack, with a whimsical and engaging representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, I read in a news article the other day that I developed iPodder, the first podcasting client in 2004. This is not true. The first podcasting client was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. I did not write &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_(aggregator)&quot;&gt;iPodder&lt;/a&gt;, it was a community effort.</description>

Also it turns out a number of established feed readers already do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278&quot;&gt;right thing&lt;/a&gt; with image enclosures. So that nails it, this is the way to do it. Support in FeedLand will be added shortly.</description>

Photographs. Paintings. News. The consensus seems to be that we should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt; element, as with podcasting. In this case, if the type begins with &quot;image/&quot; then an &lt;i&gt;artcast&lt;/i&gt; viewer should handle it, and others should ignore it. We were at this place with podcasting in 2001, and needed some examples, so we had a feed of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead music&lt;/a&gt; to start using the technology. Here's the artcasting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/artfeed.xml&quot;&gt;test feed&lt;/a&gt;. Try subscribing to it in a feed reader you like. Hopefully it either ignores the enclosure or it does the right thing with it, displays it. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/278&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for comments, questions and screen shots.</description>

			<description>I think a basic hookup to a chatbot is going to become part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec pretty quickly. So far the best one I've seen is Guy Kawasaki's. I want to be able to ask for a list of things I've written on a given topic, and to be able to ask the questions in the same straightforward way I ask ChatGPT.</description>

			<title>My gravestone visualized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love that ChatGPT makes it possible to create visualizations for ideas that previously I could only present in words. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, I like to say that when I die my gravestone should say &lt;i&gt;He's Done Digging&lt;/i&gt; or something like that, to stand in contrast to my long-lived motto -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/03/150022.html&quot;&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/a&gt; I did some writing this morning about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Future-Safe+Archives&quot;&gt;Future-Safe Archives&lt;/a&gt;, and thought to get that as a picture. The piece isn't ready to publish yet, but no reason not to share the illustration. So here it is.. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/15/headstone.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Uncle Davy, no longer diggin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: No need for an actual gravestone. Online is fine. Hopefully we'll figure out how to make such things persist before it's needed. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Why do I have to use a different editor to post to each of the services? That's the point of &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, btw.</description>

			<description>Someone must be working on a ChatGPT for SQL databases. I want to talk to my friend the chatbot, so it can write the queries for me. All the time. For example, instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/d005b639-6976-4391-bab7-e06ca9939b45&quot;&gt;asking ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; how to ask for the number of rows in a table, it could just tell me how many rows there are.</description>

			<description>You know I don't always like the same soda. Sometimes it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/diet-coke&quot;&gt;Diet Coke&lt;/a&gt;, and other times, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drpepper.com/s/products/diet-dr-pepper&quot;&gt;Diet Dr Pepper&lt;/a&gt;. But for the last year or so the drink of choice around these parts is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/fresca-sparking-soda&quot;&gt;Fresca&lt;/a&gt;. But you know what's funny. No matter what my favored drink is, it's always the one you can't get at the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://stores.hannaford.com/ny/west-hurley/8444&quot;&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt;. Always sold out. Very weird.</description>

We've been around this block so many times. The writing world of the web is full of disappointment like this. I've written this post 100,000 times by now.</description>

There have been lots of internal changes in the software, but at the same time, it still runs on a $10 a month &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean server&lt;/a&gt;, and on desktops as well. The next FeedLand works at all these levels, for a person, a workgroup and the world.

			<description>Someday an author is going to construct a universe in a LLM and let users interact with it. That sounds boring, but here's the interesting idea that led to it. Yesterday I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/11/013609.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT to draw&lt;/a&gt; me a image of an ancient band performing in the desert with cacti as the audience. Then this morning I had the idea of moving the concert into the pond behind my house, except this time &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/12/concertInThePond.png&quot;&gt;the audience are frogs&lt;/a&gt;. I have a private Facebook group where I tell the story of the pond, including the animals who come to visit. Some of them I invent, they don't actually exist. And they have relationships with each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and relationships. And other people's models could incorporate mine. This was an idea I had for SimCity, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+world+outline&quot;&gt;web of outlines&lt;/a&gt;, neither of which happened. Maybe it'll happen in LLM-land.</description>

			<description>The great thing about the private Facebook group is I have invited friends from all stages of my life. People I knew in from high school, New Orleans, Madison, Palo Alto, Cambridge and Berkeley, NYC and Woodstock. Even people I knew as a child. People I only or mostly know virtually. Imho, people who won't use Facebook miss out. Its greatest feature are the people who use it. It's the kind of village we yearn for, at a DNA level. People you will never stop loving. I don't think I've ever mentioned this group on the blog, but maybe I should do that more, because it's a uniquely civilized, friendly and soul-nourishing online place, at least for me.</description>
