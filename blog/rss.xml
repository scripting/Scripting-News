			<description>BTW, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/01/03.html#a010024&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;, last night's Knicks game was great. Up until the end, when the other guys took over and sadly the Knicks lost. We need a stronger bench. The starting five are great but they're not totally super-human.</description>

			<title>Gambling, sports, kids</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman writes&lt;/a&gt; about social media is poisoning children's minds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like that Krugman has resumed his blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This means that sometimes I agree or disagree, or have mixed opinions, but I always learn something. That's what makes a blogger good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if I agree that children's minds are being poisoned. But I am pretty sure when people like Krugman and myself reach a certain age, and we are the same age, we start looking at new media that way. Maybe &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; minds are poisoned. My father called television the &quot;idiot box.&quot; But it eventually became the literature of my generation, often very good. But maybe laws can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am sure of is that sports is being ruined by gambling. I can't imagine that a parent in 2025 would let their kids watch the NBA on TV, because it makes gambling appear to be a normal part of being a fan. Yet the NBA, which has a reputation of being socially forward-thinking, has swallowed the pill, and gambling is an integral part of coverage of the NBA now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the NFL, MLB and tennis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And is this why they can now afford to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-agrees-to-contract-with-mets&quot;&gt;sign players&lt;/a&gt; to $765 million contracts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're all getting hugely rich, but I believe that they are certainly doing great harm to the new sports fans growing up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a no apologist for being a sports fan. I love the Mets and the Knicks, have flirted with the Niners, and have a place in my heart for the Cubs and Red Sox, and I know that gambling spoils what's fun about sports, can turn it into an awful addiction. I manage to be a fan without ever having bet on a game, even just a bet between friends. I don't see it as part of sports. It wasn't the way my family enjoyed sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a math major and a 50+ year programmer, and I know that if you gamble enough you lose all your money. And as an addiction no gambler ever gets up from the table to enjoy their winnings when they win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in WordLand on New Years Day, saving it for a good moment on Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Little Feed Reader on Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;little feed reader&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lerbu7ugvc2i&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/a&gt; for you to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is how the pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;i&gt;blogroll&lt;/i&gt; category on feedland.social to determine what's posted on Bluesky. When I add or remove feeds from the category, the OPML adjusts dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm running a new Node app that has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/websocket&quot;&gt;websocket&lt;/a&gt; connection to feedland.social. It receives all the new items as they are found from all feeds over the socket. It's feedland.social's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pubnub.com/learn/glossary/firehose-api/&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt;. Since I'm currently the only user of that server, it's getting news from the all feeds I follow, not just the ones in the blogroll category. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app checks each new item to see if it's in one of the feeds in the OPML list. If so, it reformats it to fit in a Bluesky post and sends it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy&quot;&gt;feediverse account&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're subscribed you should see the item, with a link, in your Bluesky timeline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Node app re-loads the OPML subscription list every minute so any change is quickly reflected.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; you &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/expandedBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog's home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/issues/1&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; in getting this running was rate-limiting. I have dealt with this on Twitter and other services, but Bluesky was not, for a while, letting anything through with the error message that we were over the limit. It was suggested that we should cache the accessToken rather get a new one for every message. I did that and cautiously turned the server on again at first with a 5 message per hour self-imposed limit, then gradually increased it to 10 per hour. The latest version only requires that there be at least five minutes between posts, so that means no more than 12 per hour. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lerhvj52pk27&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt; for the initial idea and his support. He saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and asked if it could work in Bluesky. That was the idea. I have always wanted a tight coupling between Bluesky and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; but didn't know how to do it. We may have just skipped a step. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We realllly could use some more formating features in Bluesky messages. This is a really strong use-case imho for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The coolest thing from my point of view is that I already had all the pieces, fully developed, the only thing that remained was to hook them together. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/feediverse/bluesky/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for Little Feed Reader. It's purposely brief, but I have put a link to this post on that page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; and edited a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/&quot;&gt;complete blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a response to something &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds&quot;&gt;Krugman wrote&lt;/a&gt;, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso&quot;&gt;Marge said&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Fargo. &quot;There's more to life than a little money, you know.&quot; It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper&quot;&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.</description>
