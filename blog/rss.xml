			<description>I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tonykahn.org/home&quot;&gt;this autobiographical site&lt;/a&gt; where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn't often credited. He was at WGBH at the time.</description>

			<description>Where is the AI-based meme maker for Kamala. I'd like to have her flying in the sky with a cape, like SuperPresidentLady, going from town to town, finding out what they need, and churning it out for them in an efficiently run government meme factory in the nation's capital. Like we were doing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kitten&quot;&gt;kittens&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer.</description>
