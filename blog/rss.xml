			<description>As &lt;a href=&quot;https://tantek.com/2023/296/t1/posse-syndicate-link-reply&quot;&gt;Tantek describes POSSE&lt;/a&gt; it sounds tedious. Imho, web writing is supposed to be a joy. When you push an idea into the world it should feel powerful not laborious. When the process of writing and revising is trouble, the writing is troubled. I find sometimes it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; tedious, like arranging the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/24/122615.html&quot;&gt;delicious artwork&lt;/a&gt; that DALLE made for me (and you), but that always inspires me, as a software developer, to look for ways to smooth the process. We call that paving cow paths, and that's my process. So let's do it. Take Tantek's vision, which we share, and make it work, for real. In the case of blog-peering, we can learn from podcasting and make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;sharing process&lt;/a&gt; for writing as smooth.</description>

			<title>Art is about the observer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked DALLE to do some art in the style of Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Rembrandt and Georgia O'Keefe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked for artwork about Twitter from each artist. Just about Twitter. My instructions to ChatGPT were: &quot;Imagine Diego Rivera painting about Twitter.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The designs were by ChatGPT and the execution by DALLE.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before all this happened I had an idea of what art is. It isn't the creation of the artist, it's what the observer creates in their mind from participating in the work -- that's the art. I'm not trying to twist words, this is just what I think art is. To the extent that my software is art, it is all about the user. What do you create with my outliner and news manager? You and us. What do we create together? That's the art. The art continues long after I've stopped coding. It starts when you recall an idea you had last Tuesday and improve on it, and relate it to someone else's idea next week and in 2029.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's why we're so puzzled by some art, we're wondering what the artist was trying to say. Not really important, what matters is what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; saw. And there's a precise answer for that, and only you know the answer. Your exploration of yourself is why we make art. It's where the art is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, look at what the freaking computer created. These are just a few examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/24/rembrandtOnTwitter.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Rembrandt on Twitter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/24/kahloOnTwitter.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kahlo on Twitter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/24/riveraOnTwitter.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Rivera on Twitter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The nice thing about ChatGPT is that when you want to know something like how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7555aac2-f312-403f-953a-9b812de37f80&quot;&gt;hard-reload any popular browser&lt;/a&gt; for advice to a user, or know what &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/fb172a67-2d89-41bf-8b3e-743cb738e620&quot;&gt;Writing-First workflow&lt;/a&gt; is -- you get a complete answer without any of the junk writing you get from a commercial journalism site. And it seems not to forget (or bury) the one piece of information you came there for.</description>

I'll get there, but I don't like the stack I'm working in, the browser and its ridiculousness, then JavaScript and its idea of program synchrozation and structure, then HTTP which is simple enough, but of course Google couldn't leave that alone, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js&quot;&gt;JavaScript again&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt; where, instead of calling into another stack, you write scripts, send them over the wire. At least what you get back is a JavaScript object, imagine if everyone had to parse the text result that I'm sure SQL must send back. None of this history has been factored or smoothed out, yet we can get something as clever as &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; running. Imagine if the runtime environment were &lt;i&gt;designed&lt;/i&gt; for the kind of work we're doing.</description>

			<title>POSSE is the right idea but...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the ideal of POSSE, an acronym coming out of the indieweb group, but.. It's like the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDE8XG_aAHw&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; near the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets&quot;&gt;As Good As It Gets&lt;/a&gt;, where Melvin (played by Jack Nicholson) is professing his love for Carol (Helen Hunt), acting as nuts as ever, and she blurts out: Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me! This is the big moment, because we know he's crazy, and she knows it, and of course she's crazy too and maybe just starting to catch on, when her mother pops out from behind the door and delivers the big line in the movie: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Everybody wants that dear. It doesn't exist.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with POSSE. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Everybody wants it, but it doesn't exist. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Twitter took off in 2006 it was the first thought every blogger had, can I cross-post from my blog to Twitter, but Twitter had nothing that our blogs had. Posts couldn't have titles, no links, styling, and it was limited to 140 characters. It's as if they put a big sign out front saying &quot;No POSSE here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook said the same thing, no titles, no styling, but it didn't have a character limit, and while Twitter's API didn't allow updating, Facebook's did. Here's the catch -- if you wanted to cross-post to Facebook, you had to write text that would make sense even if the links didn't come through, and that really screws with the art of web writing. I tried it and hated it as much as I loved the open web. I tried to make it work for years, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;eventually gave up&lt;/a&gt;, and went back to blogging the way of the web, and I was a much happier writer, even if I didn't have the reach that Facebook offered. I still to this day have a lot of friends on Facebook, and if they want to read what I write, they have to go outside of Facebook, because my writing can't get in there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even Medium, which was created by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)&quot;&gt;founder of Blogger&lt;/a&gt; couldn't fit into the POSSE model because posts couldn't be updated. Otherwise it came pretty close to the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of posting on your blog and cross-posting to lots of place &lt;i&gt;is the right idea,&lt;/i&gt; no argument there, the problem is that the places you can actually cross-post to are few and far-between. The two places mentioned in the article that can peer with most other blogging software are &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. Everything else as far as I know, if you want to peer with them in a POSSE-like way, requires you to remove features from your writing, and you have to decide if it's worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But now I want to try again -- because the time is right -- with Twitter falling into the background, pretty quickly, there are new platforms that are pretty close to being able to peer with blogging software, Mastodon and other ActivityPub systems, BlueSky and a few others. If we're going to organize, we should get together on the features we want in our blogs to be mirrored elsewhere and help the developers of those systems achieve it. And we should emphasize that it can be done, because we have examples that do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I put up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; for what that feature set would be. It's pretty simple, but in order for it to work, we have to work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The features are:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Optional titles&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Simple styling&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Enclosures&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited length&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Editable&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. I could peer my posts with any system that supported those features. You can even support just a subset as long as you pass along all the data you get in your outbound feeds. I think with that simple system we could rebuild the social media world so that no one dominates, and we can always try out new ideas, and you can use the editing tools you like, and I can use the ones I like. It would finally be a writer's web, something that, after 30 years we still haven't &lt;i&gt;begun&lt;/i&gt; to build. Let's do it! We have a chance now, all we have to do is work with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This is the big moment, because we know he's crazy, and she knows it, and of course she's crazy too and maybe just starting to catch on, when her mother pops out from behind the door and delivers the big line in the movie:" created="Mon, 23 Oct 2023 22:04:00 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/23.html#a220400">

				<source:outline text="When Twitter took off in 2006 it was the first thought every blogger had, can I cross-post from my blog to Twitter, but Twitter had nothing that our blogs had.

				<source:outline text="Facebook said the same thing, no titles, no styling, but it didn't have a character limit, and while Twitter's API didn't allow updating, Facebook's did. Here's the catch -- if you wanted to cross-post to Facebook, you had to write text that would make sense even if the links didn't come through, and that really screws with the art of web writing. I tried it and hated it as much as I loved the open web. I tried to make it work for years, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;eventually gave up&lt;/a&gt;, and went back to blogging the way of the web, and I was a much happier writer, even if I didn't have the reach that Facebook offered. I still to this day have a lot of friends on Facebook, and if they want to read what I write, they have to go outside of Facebook, because my writing can't get in there." created="Mon, 23 Oct 2023 22:07:28 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/23.html#a220728"/>

				<source:outline text="The idea of posting on your blog and cross-posting to lots of place &lt;i&gt;is the right idea,&lt;/i&gt; no argument there, the problem is that the places you can actually cross-post to are few and far-between. The two places mentioned in the article that can peer with most other blogging software are &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.

It would finally be a writer's web, something that, after 30 years we still haven't &lt;i&gt;begun&lt;/i&gt; to build. Let's do it!

And who there are so many subdomains of scripting.com started over 30 years and left standing, and all the HTTP urls hanging off them, I'll retire long before I consider that much crazy work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't accumulate 30 years of archives thinking someday you're going to convert every page and thus break all the images.

			<title>Thinking out loud is blogging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's weird that people have the idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+thinking+out+loud&quot;&gt;thinking out loud&lt;/a&gt; is a new idea for blogging. That's because when journalists first heard about blogging they decided that it's what they do. People who write publicly for money, mostly without any principle other than getting paid for writing, or perhaps &quot;building a brand.&quot; That imho was not what was going on. It was people asking questions, often in the form of statements they weren't sure of. Put it out there, see what comes back. At its best it was what I called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+sources+go+direct&quot;&gt;sources go direct&lt;/a&gt; -- where people with expertise shared what they knew so we could learn from them. So the idea of a public &quot;garden&quot; is just a response to journalists getting the story totally wrong about blogging in the early days. Amazing how these things cycle round and round often because of basic misunderstandings like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love to cite this &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/10/cartoon.gif&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; from the 2004 Democratic Convention which first opened its doors to bloggers. I was one of them. They saw us as gatecrashers. We were just people who have the need to blog. A small number of people were born to write about what they see, and the web opened that up to all of us, for the first time it took almost no money to get your ideas out there, and clearly they were scared of us. What a crime that actual people would be reporting on the events of our democracy. They're so stuck in their calcified thought patterns that it never occurred to them that this is great, people who actually give a shit, wanting to tell other people what they saw and heard. Unfortunately they got their way, that's how powerful they are and how easily manipulated we all are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

People will visit to see New York's museums, see sports games, attend NYU, Columbia and the Bronx High School of Science, all galactically renowned educational institutions. Most alien beings will not be humanoid. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was presented with four illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;1. Photo of the futuristic New York Harbor as a bustling space port. Numerous advanced spaceships are seen descending from the sky, some with designs native to the Milky Way galaxy. The skyline of New York is still recognizable but has been augmented with futuristic architectures. Aboard the ships, a diverse array of alien beings disembark. Some float, some have multiple limbs, and they come in various colors and sizes. They interact with humans and each other, many holding digital guides highlighting New York's museums and educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/22/nyharborspaceport.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;A bustling New York Harbor transformed into a space port.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. Illustration of the entrance to NYU in 2123. The iconic Washington Square Arch stands tall, but now with holographic enhancements. Students of various species walk, float, or glide into the campus. Some aliens are seen engaging in animated discussions with human professors. Banners in the background promote intergalactic exchange programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/22/nyu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Entrance to NYU in 2123 with the iconic Washington Square Arch and holographic enhancements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;3. Photo of an intergalactic sports game taking place in a futuristic stadium in New York. The game is a mix of soccer and a sport from another galaxy, played by teams comprising both humans and aliens. The audience is a melting pot of species from different planets, cheering passionately for their favorite teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/22/sportvenue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;An intergalactic sports game taking place in a futuristic stadium in New York.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;4. Watercolor painting of the Bronx High School of Science's main entrance. This prestigious school now has a massive holographic globe above it, displaying various constellations. Students, both human and alien, rush in, some levitating their books and some using advanced tech wearables for learning. A group of alien parents is seen taking a campus tour, marvelling at the institution's history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/22/bronxScience.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Bronx High School of Science's main entrance with a massive holographic globe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I wonder where the rendering is being done. An incentive to use a server that supports Markdown. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.masto.land/home&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, which I am operating, also has a character limit of 10000, which is effectively no limit. I think perhaps the dust is starting to settle on Masto, the fog is lifting. Maybe a subset of servers, called Maxtodon perhaps, would be the service worth paying for.</description>

			<title>What is a reading list?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A reading list is a list of feeds you can subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author of the list can add or remove feeds. When they do, people who subscribe to the list are subscribed to the new feeds and unsubbed from the ones that leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It means that there can be lots of specialized software that reads feeds, and the user gets to broadcast their subscriptions to all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also means that influencers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Andrew Hickey&lt;/a&gt; can keep his community up to date on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kcbapf5mde2w&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; he loves. Someday he will have a reading list, and I will subscribe to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technically a reading list is exactly the same format as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription list&lt;/a&gt;. The only difference is you import a subscription list, and you subscribe to a reading list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Playing with the new DALL-E</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to work with DALL-E to create an ad for ThinkTank for the Mac in 1984, suitable to run in MacWorld magazine. What it came up with was dazzling. The software doesn't look anything like ThinkTank, which is par for the course. Ad agencies back then did the same thing. They showed readers what they thought we had described, and didn't bother looking at the actual screens. They treated us like hopeless nerds when we asked them to please show the actual products, that users would be able to see through this ruse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/21/thinkTankAdByAI.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;DALL-E's rendering of an ad spec'd by ChatGPT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, here's how ChatGPT explained the ad: &quot;Illustration of an ad for the 'thinktank' software from 1984. A young professional woman sits at her desk, deeply engrossed in using her Macintosh computer. The 'thinktank' software is visible on the screen, prominently displaying a detailed presentation outline. The text reads: 'The Future of Presentations is Here: thinktank for Mac!' The overall aesthetic is vibrant and distinctly 80s, with bold typefaces, neon colors, and a touch of retro flair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new DALL-E is much much better than the previous one. What's great is that it's integrated with ChatGPT so you can have a conversation with it. Also there do not seem to be the previous limits of a few pictures per month. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked it to create a header image for my blog. Here was the spec: &quot;I need a new header image for my blog, Scripting News. I want it to be imagery from The Matrix, with Neo, Morpheus, Agent Smith, Trinity, The Oracle, and Spoon Boy, my favorite characters in The Matrix, in an image that's roughly 1600 by 250 pixels (or proportional). Use the dark styling of the Matrix.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It couldn't use the actual characters because of copyright limits, so it tried to produce something in the same style as The Matrix, but after four attempts couldn't get the proper proportions. The images were lovely, but not suitable for a header image because of size. Here's one of them to give you an idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/21/matrixStyleImageByDallE.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Photo of a futuristic dark city skyline with green digital rain falling from the sky, reminiscent of the Matrix. Neon signs with code symbols glow in the distance, illuminating alleys and streets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can debate whether ChatGPT is intelligent or creative, but to me, a human who is (supposedly) both intelligent and creative, I can't tell the difference. And it's infinitely patient and always tries to do what I ask it to do. And unlike humans it doesn't judge me based on gender, race, age, religion or any number of other criteria that humans use to justify hating other people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next request: &quot;I’d like a picture of Abraham Lincoln playing with the Grateful Dead at Woodstock. He’s playing lead guitar and singing Casey Jones.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It said no. But it could give me a generic tall politician with a generic band at a generic concert. I said OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/21/notAbrahamLincoln.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Generic tall politician from 1860s playing Dead-like music.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked if it could replace Lincoln with a rhinoceros.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/21/rhinoRocker.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Rhino playing the part of Abraham Lincoln at Woodstock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And there's no doubt who it will be this year, but no spoilers. Also around this time each year we start thinking about which movies will be in this year's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+njff&quot;&gt;NakedJen Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, a tradition on Christmas Day every year when all the best pictures come out. Recent years the NJFF as its fans lovingly refer to it has been a virtual event, thanks to streaming, BitTorrent, COVID and the fact that Jen moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City&quot;&gt;SLC&lt;/a&gt;, though we have held them in realspace in NYC and SLC since then.</description>

			<description>Twitter &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/x-twitter-elon-musk-israel-hamas-gaza-misinformation-meta-threads.html?via=rss&quot;&gt;shell of its former self&lt;/a&gt;, I can see that in my own behavior. I used to help out voluntarily to vet posts their bots thought were questionable, but I don't do that any more. I don't feel any sense of ownership of Twitter. Looking back, it's surprising that I ever did. I also used to run polls there, but I don't do that any longer. And when something new is happening, I have no idea where to go, but I don't go to Twitter like I used to. These are facts. Not anything I ever weighed and &lt;i&gt;decided&lt;/i&gt; to stop doing, I just don't do them. And yes I think it's a good thing that the fog of Twitter is clearing. There was a time when I hoped interesting ideas would pop up in the blogosphere, but then we got lost in all the bullshit of Twitter, and now that's over. So maybe there's room for the web being used, once again, as a way of connecting real people in smaller numbers.</description>

Computers, on the other hand, now that they've learned how to program themselves, could obsolete all human programmers in an instant.

I just realized I can convert my &lt;a href=&quot;http://artshow.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Artshow app&lt;/a&gt; that used to run on the Twitter API to run on Bluesky art feeds. This is going to be interesting.</description>

			<description>Note to people running their own FeedLand instances. There's a new version of the server that handles &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/40&quot;&gt;reading lists&lt;/a&gt;. This will be an important feature going forward. Right now what it needs most is testing and feedback. The user interface is very provisional.</description>

			<title>Drummer and OPML files</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;'s native file format is &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and OPML is the format for reading lists. This has led to some very nice synergies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Example: A script you can add to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1627490175000&quot;&gt;Scripts menu&lt;/a&gt; that asks for the URL of a feed, and inserts a node into your outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var url = dialog.ask (&quot;URL of feed&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var theFeed = rss.readFeed (url)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.insert (theFeed.title)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.attributes.addGroup ({type: 'rss', xmlUrl: url})&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the DocServer pages&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=dialog.ask&quot;&gt;dialog.ask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=rss.readFeed&quot;&gt;rss.readFeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=op.insert&quot;&gt;op.insert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=op.attributes.addGroup&quot;&gt;op.attributes.addGroup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Took five minutes to write and worked the first time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The Nth statement doesn't start until the one before it completes. This version of JavaScript is optimized for the 99% of times you want synchronous code, makes that the default, as all reasonable languages do. Otherwise it's plain old JavaScript, which is a fine Algol-like language. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The verbs, dialog.ask, rss.readFeed, op.insert, op.attributes.addGroup, are designed to reduce complicated things to their most simple core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=rss.readFeed&quot;&gt;rss.readFeed&lt;/a&gt;, for example, builds on a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt; of understanding feed reading, parses all common formats that fit under the RSS umbrella and makes it all flat. Factoring is the antidote to chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And &quot;op&quot; stands for outline processor. Those verbs go back to the late 80s when they were the first verbs in my first language outliner I called Betty. Why change the name of verbs if they work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; that one way to do something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just listened to an hour of McCartney on Apple Music, and I love his stuff, but the best songs he did were collaborations with the rest of the band. No one of them had the magic, it was all of them. Take a minute and listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLRiGX3L-kw&quot;&gt;Lady Madonna&lt;/a&gt;. Lennon says &lt;a href=&quot;https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/every-song-by-the-beatles-john-lennon-hated/&quot;&gt;he didn't like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Madonna&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;, but I can hear him in it. It's got the edge that McCartney alone doesn't have. Compare it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdDPR8GzXy8&quot;&gt;Maybe I'm Amazed&lt;/a&gt;, the first song that the bot picked. It's like listening to part of one channel of a Beatles song.</description>

It is not factoring if you replace a pattern with another equally complicated pattern. Factoring is why the software you make in 2023 should be more powerful than the software you did in 2013 and 2003. Factoring happens slowly, usually. Sometimes factoring happens in a moment, when you realize how to reduce something by making a small change somewhere else. &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/editThisPage&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; was one of those.</description>

Sometimes factoring happens in a moment, when you realize how to reduce something by making a small change somewhere else. &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/editThisPage&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; was one of those." created="Fri, 13 Oct 2023 14:26:04 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/13.html#a142604"/>

			<description>A great example of factoring is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/a&gt; function in JavaScript. There was a pattern, a for loop that iterated over an array with an index. They took out the index and did the iterating for you. It's a small simplification, and I smile every time I use it because the got rid of a little drudge work for me when entering it and reading the code. In no way a big deal, but nice that they found a way to make things easier and faster. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/b0801e46-dc1d-436d-980e-cd23bd054a95&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; why forEach is so great, but they use other &quot;advances&quot; in JavaScript that I consider unnecessary, not useful, cryptic, and I don't use them.</description>

			<title>Why Mastodon isn't The One</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Take a break from your busy day and &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/subToProPublica.png&quot;&gt;study this picture&lt;/a&gt;. It's why Mastodon as a federated system is not going to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I decided to follow ProPublica.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I clicked on the &lt;i&gt;Follow&lt;/i&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/subToProPublica.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; showed up with a very complicated set of instructions. It requires me to remember an address that I do not remember. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Instead of following, I wrote this blog post, because it was simpler to do this and I'm tired of people ignoring this because I care about us getting this right. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why will it never work? Why is Mastodon &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; The One? I know, because I thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; should do what Twitter ended up doing and the main reason that happened is that to follow someone in Twitter is one click, and you're done, and I don't even want to write down the process for feeds because it's even worse than what it is in Mastodon today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/11/frankfurter.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Not that we didn't know this at the time, we did, or how to solve it at a technical level. I tried to get everyone to work with us on making subscription simple, but it didn't happen. Later I came to believe it couldn't. We &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; force everyone to use the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;export format&lt;/a&gt;, that worked incredibly well. But every RSS reader developer acted as if they were the only product that did what they did and didn't want to do anything they didn't have to to make it easy for people to subscribe in other reader software. It's so convoluted and stupid, you have to figure the people making the actual decisions had never used an RSS reader and never wanted to subscribe to a feed. This, btw, is pretty common in the tech industry, product ignorance among key decision-makers. I even heard a CEO once boast that he didn't need to use the product because he's a 'market of one' as if all his customers were frankfurter &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstituted_meat&quot;&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the bottom line. If subscription isn't one-click in your federated social media system, go back to the drawing board and re-do your architecture, because it won't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: After writing the post I was calmer and remembered where my account was, and it was two steps from there to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsie.social/@ProPublica&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I didn't start out this way, quite the opposite, I thought everyone wanted to do good stuff that makes the world better. We certainly need a lot more of that. But being in it for yourself is a survival trait I guess, and until we reinvent evolution to select for group-good, we're more or less permanently fucked.

			<title>ActivityPub?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's been some recent discussion about whether ActivityPub is the standard everyone should be building on, and that new ways of social networking, or even previously existing ones, should stop and implement ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My answer is this -- if ActivityPub were sufficient, I'd say yes -- let's coalesce around one standard, and stop trying to make something slightly better. I have a motto that goes with this -- One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. For a couple of reasons: 1. You still have to support both, so you just made everyone's life more complicated, assuming the second way gains traction. 2. The goal is interop, not creating standards. Both of these are part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But honestly, ActivityPub is both insufficient and a mess. And I'm not even convinced that what it's doing is all that worthwhile. I don't see conversation on social nets as having much value. Replies to my posts tend to be spam, people looking for exposure, hitching a ride on a post that's getting some flow, or to be annoying. It's very rare that new ideas or information come to light this way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And all the arguing in the world won't change the way things are going. ActivityPub isn't the standard. People want to be Mastodon-compatible, not ActivityPub-compatible. Much of what Mastodon is doing isn't part of ActivityPub, it's their own API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen it said that Atom was a good thing, that somehow &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; wasn't enough. And all the &quot;IndieWeb&quot; protocols that just reinvent the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt;. Depends what your goals were. If you were intending to keep RSS and the blogging APIs from growing, then they were great successes. People spent time judging not aiming for more interop, whether items had their proper names, which is a common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution_(biology)&quot;&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt; in this kind of work, they even have a name for it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality&quot;&gt;bike-shedding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's better to reduce the number of competing formats than to increase the number. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Again all that matters is interop, and splitting an open standard into multiple competing standards works &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to ActivityPub. I wish it were simpler, that you could get something interesting working quickly that delivers interop. But it isn't that way, and no one seems interested in making it so. So imho the world will not coalesce behind ActivityPub, I wish it could, but it can't and won't happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="My answer is this -- if ActivityPub were sufficient, I'd say yes -- let's coalesce around one standard, and stop trying to make something slightly better. I have a motto that goes with this -- One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. For a couple of reasons: 1. You still have to support both, so you just made everyone's life more complicated, assuming the second way gains traction. 2. The goal is interop, not creating standards. Both of these are part of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;." created="Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:41:30 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/10.html#a114130"/>
				<source:outline text="But honestly, ActivityPub is both insufficient and a mess. And I'm not even convinced that what it's doing is all that worthwhile. I don't see conversation on social nets as having much value. Replies to my posts tend to be spam, people looking for exposure, hitching a ride on a post that's getting some flow, or to be annoying. It's very rare that new ideas or information come to light this way." created="Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:43:47 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/10/10.html#a114347"/>
