They're playing their own game, trying to self-pardon in a way, to avoid being a target for the incoming administration, which we're all scared of, and I guess that's the point, to scare us.</description>

			<title>We need a BDG for Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/pfefferle.org/post/3lcfkqqlcfk2j&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky this morning from a friend, Matthias Pfefferle, who works at Automattic on the connection between WordPress and ActivityPub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A BDG is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide&quot;&gt;Busy Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, something we did &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;for SOAP&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; onto it.  Since then there have been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It's a useful concept because developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that works, and we'll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop, which is the point of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user's writing in a PDS. If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it works there. We can do that because we're using popular simple formats like JSON (see below) to organize our work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you're reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; in a repository on GitHub. Broken down into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07&quot;&gt;months&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07/18&quot;&gt;days&lt;/a&gt;, and posts. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each post is a JSON file, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2019/03/03/a025810.json&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. It has three bits of data, the text of the post, when it was created (which also serves as a unique ID, no two posts have the same creation date) and type. This item has a type of outline, because it can have structure, though this post does not. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2022/07/06/a232835.json&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; that does have structure. In Bluesky it would be represented as a thread. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the question. What's the absolutely simplest way to have that structure of posts represented in a Bluesky PDS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/674f3d6c-4904-8012-b071-953862cd5b4a&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT to scope this out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to lift the hood even if I don't understand what I'm looking at.</description>

			<description>I'm using the term &quot;RSS-based podcasts&quot; in place of &quot;podcasts&quot; to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other &quot;podcasts,&quot; are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their &quot;podcasts&quot; to RSS and everyone's happy. Like &quot;organic cheeseburgers.&quot; :-)</description>

			<description>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</description>

			<description>Welcome to the last month of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!</description>

			<description>I wasn't clear enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. We're losing the word &quot;podcast&quot; very quickly. It's coming to mean video interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there's no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who will want to impose severe limits. This isn't a casual &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt;, it's &lt;i&gt;urgent.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

And when they want to edit the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasn’t been moving  and if we don’t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get started.</description>

			<title>The Kennedy v Nixon template</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Analogously, Trump is Kennedy and Biden/Harris is Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the social web is, in 2024, what TV was in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump has mastered the new medium. To a large extent, he &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; the new medium, and the resulting network formed around him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-did-trump-win-james-carville-has-discovered-an/id1728152109?i=1000678267539&quot;&gt;Carville says&lt;/a&gt; he wants to figure out how to communicate the way Trump did, he can't because our way doesn't work in his universe. We have to create our own. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogously Nixon might have said about TV in 1959 -- how can we get into that? If you have to ask you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; get there. You have to fit like a hand in a glove, like Kennedy or Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next Democratic candidate to win the presidency will have to be a media creator. They must create a medium that's perfectly adapted to the communication interests of the 50 percent of the electorate that voted for Harris and the other 20 percent who would if they just knew who she was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look at the picture of Kennedy and Nixon. Did we elect Kennedy over Nixon because he had better policy? No. We elected him because he has better hair. Because on TV what counts is your hair. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chris+lydon&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; who was a TV news person told me that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/28/kennedyNixon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Kennedy and Nixon on the debate stage in 1960.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to win, create an internet farm system. A network with everyone who wants to run for office nationwide on the Democratic ticket. And let's see how they work in the new medium. We get to know them like we knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/11/26/weElectedArchieBunker.html&quot;&gt;Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. And let's get some people we get to know who also tend to tell the truth (though they can screw up and we'll forgive them, remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html&quot;&gt;gotchas&lt;/a&gt; are over).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The US government acquires Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The &quot;constitution&quot; reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems, they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been &lt;i&gt;cartelized,&lt;/i&gt; which is one step beyond &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/11/22/214100.html&quot;&gt;enshitified&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>If such a network existed, we would be nominating our own Cabinet members, the shadow Cabinet. Let the journalists compare the qualifications of our candidates vs the incumbent party's. Create news. That's what the Dems absolutely suck at. They very quietly pass legislation that the other party (which votes against) takes credit for. One party is on the air, the other is not. We need to change that. We make news. And we listen to each other, not just the stuffed shirts who run the party now.</description>

			<description>One of the best things about ChatGPT is that you can ask it to put together exactly the report you want, that the news orgs aren't writing, or you can't find, or get to through paywalls.

Bluesky is hot now, but this isn't over yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Developers are deliberately locking their users in by creating new APIs that are not only incompatible with previously existing APIs, but also are difficult for developers who learned earlier APIs to adopt because now they have all kinds of replicated code for different systems. It adds another level of complexity to the developer's code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What each platform vendor wants is not only captive users, but also locked-in developers. Why do you think they all have new languages? Come on is Swift really better than Go or React or whatever. Groups of Mac developers constantly spinning their wheels to keep up with Apple breaking releases. Groups of JavaScript developers. And there are many &lt;i&gt;kinds&lt;/i&gt; of JS devs. When does it end. Ones who build on OpenAI and others that develop on the APIs of other vendors (I'm not even trying to go on that ride, too late in my career.) There's so much confusion, that leads to exhaustion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we're feeling it especially hard when there are such ill-conceived duplicate APIs that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; could have been done with RSS 2.0 and OPML.  Every one of them. Cory Doctorow, who came up with the term enshitification, also wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise&quot;&gt;passionate piece about RSS&lt;/a&gt;. I want to say to my friend Cory, if a system isn't built on RSS at this point, they are certainly trying to lock users and developers in. I don't care if it's ActivityPub or ATProto or Facebook or Meta or X or Twitter (sorry I can't keep up with their names). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to build on a system that's pure inbound and outbound RSS. Give me lists in OPML and the please just let me ignore the rest of your lockin strategy. They talk a good line about wanting interop, federation and standards, but their actions speak otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At a conference the CEO of twitter-splitter Bluesky said her product is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html&quot;&gt;billionaire-proof&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't seem too likely to me that it is. And maybe they're quoting her incorrectly. A billionaire could take it over and the users would have no recourse, the whole thing would blow up even more quickly than Twitter is (and I'm not convinced it has blown up, there still seems to be a lot going on there, I think perhaps people are exaggerating how polluted it is or maybe I'm being shielded by an algorithm). It would be nice to use a system that is truly billionaire-proof. How about building a network on top of something else that is 100 percent RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, RSS is probably the closest to billionaire-proof. I don't get royalties on it, lots of people have tried to make big bucks from it, but so far its only allegiance is to people who want to publish and receive news. If a billionaire could buy it, they probably would have by now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/16/archieAndEdith.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;When people said they didn't know Kamala well, they weren't kidding. She didn't start broadcasting until three months before the election. That's not even one season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Elementary&quot;&gt;Abbott Elementary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show)&quot;&gt;Wheel of Fortune&lt;/a&gt;. Of course they didn't know her. That's because the Dems go off the air &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1854036662952620232&quot;&gt;on Election Day&lt;/a&gt; and don't show up again for three years. Meanwhile the other party is on the air 24 hours a day, every day of every year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next time we nominate a candidate, the voters will already know them and like them. No more of the &quot;we don't know her well enough.&quot; That's what mattered. They want a sense that they know who you are. The same way kids of my generation knew who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker&quot;&gt;Archie Bunker&lt;/a&gt; was, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maude_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Maude&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore&quot;&gt;Mary Tyler Moore&lt;/a&gt;. That's where trust comes from. We may not have liked Archie Bunker's politics, but we knew who he was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time so when we choose a candidate the people will already know and like them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-setback-for-trump-as-gopers-privately-tell-him/id1728152109?i=1000677605316&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; where Greg Sargent and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-cabinet-team-of-outlaws-gaetz-hegseth-gabbard-rfk&quot;&gt;guest&lt;/a&gt; kept saying &quot;we gotta figure this out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/27/successionPoster.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The answer is staring you in the face. Dems are only on the air for a few months every four years. Of course the other side spins you like crazy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You all are clinging to the &quot;gotcha&quot; model of journalism. There are no more gotchas. We've known that since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape&quot;&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of the new Democratic Party will be comfortable in their own skin. They tell you what they think. Fetterman, AOC, Tammy Baldwin. There will be many of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying.

			<description>It's noteworthy that we haven't seen many outages as Bluesky scales. On Twitter they had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2011/12/31/failWhale.gif&quot;&gt;fail whales&lt;/a&gt; for years.</description>

			<description>What matters with social networks is what you can get done there, not so much the features of the network. Bluesky has the same features today it had a month ago. The difference is we had an election in the US, I guess that was the catalyst. The presence of Elon Musk so close to Trump says there is a need for a Musk-free place. I've kept my account on Twitter. I started there in 2006, and I love the web more than I feel it would do any good to erase my presence there. It's pretty much against my religion to deliberately erase bits of the web. And whatever you think of Twitter, it is most definitely part of the web.</description>
