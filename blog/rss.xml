			<description>When you're buying a house, the most important thing to check is the roof. Get two inspections. Get three. A house with a good roof will keep you dry. A house with a shitty roof isn't really a house is it?</description>

Her frustration sounds a lot like mine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;I wrote in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the bankers in tech should watch out because Twitter had just elected a president, and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization&quot;&gt;market capitalization&lt;/a&gt; was so low that it was bound to get bought by someone who saw that you could buy the presidency of the United States for a few billion dollars. Was it worth that? Absolutely, as we're learning. All I got were pats on the head, stories about PE ratios, which of course I understand. What it did show is &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; didn't understand that the presidency could and would be monetized. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Kendzior posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/sarahkendzior.bsky.social/post/3masr4jsesk2z&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about how frustrating it was that all the &quot;new&quot; details of the Epstein scandal were known in 2020, and published in her book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiding_in_Plain_Sight_(Kendzior_book)&quot;&gt;Hiding in Plain Sight&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds like what I've been saying about how tech and news works, we just come at it from different perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if there's a way around the ownership of news in the US, if there's still a way to route around it, but I'm sure that &lt;a href=&quot;https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt; on Substack, which is owned by the same people she doesn't trust with other journalism, is not the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In order for news to have a chance of working we need to be using only the web, commodity services that are completely replaceable, and we keep our own writing, and route it to everyone who's interested via the open protocols of the web. That's the only way people with important ideas and info can get it out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think in order for this to work we have to have people like Kendzior, and Heather Cox Richardson, Paul Krugman, publishing via the web, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/&quot;&gt;via Substack&lt;/a&gt;. It should be fine for Substack to continue to publish their stuff, no problem with that, but they shouldn't be the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; place their stuff is published. That gives them near-total control of the writers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our bigger problem is news distribution that works, and not depending on system we have. It may be too late to fix it, but we have to try. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The story Kendzior was writing about was not covered yesterday on CNN or MSNOW, as far as I can tell. It got dumped on Christmas Day, I guess -- and that's probably the best day in the US to dump a story you want to get lost in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU1bzm-BW0o&quot;&gt;haze&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The title of this piece recalls a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22the%20fog%20of%20war%22&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; documentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War&quot;&gt;The Fog of War&lt;/a&gt;, about America at war in Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Was it worth that? Absolutely, as we're learning. All I got were pats on the head, stories about PE ratios, which of course I understand.

			<description>One of the reasons ChatGPT dominates in discussions about scientific issues is that it can type at a much high rate than a human can, and produces reams of ways of saying the same thing, and again always tries to take over the lead in determining which direction to go next. It leads to ridiculous situations where it's guessing at what FeedLand does, and it's all over the map, but I actually know what it does, because I wrote it and support it. It's not funny, it's very bad for getting things done. You can tell it to talk less, and for a while it remembers, but in a few days it'll be doing it again. Yet it still is very very useful. It's just talks too much. Kind of like the way if I put my name in a search query on Google it asks if I really meant &quot;winter&quot; instead of my actual last name, which it knows. Stupid f'ing machines.</description>

			<description>I'm probably extra impatient because I'm a former CEO, and had enough people in my loop every day that if even one person stretched things out the way ChatGPT does, I wouldn't necessarily fire them, if their work was good, I'd just find another way to catch up on their work. I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_wandering_around&quot;&gt;management by walking around&lt;/a&gt;, I would get ideas hearing people explain how their work was going.

They might let you in, but I doubt they would do that until they had a feature that competes with your add-in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sure you can build another network using their identity system, and that was exactly the deal Twitter offered us. I went for it -- who wants to develop a new identity system, when good old Twitter was letting us use theirs. I really think they meant well, sort of fits in with Jack Dorsey's way of looking at things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a good deal for a lot of years, but then one day Elon Musk bought the company, and soon all bets were off. We had little warning before we had to move our act and all our users to another identity system. Lost a lot of traction right there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My advice -- think this through, now. And if you can't see a way that you share in the success of the company behind Bluesky, which we know very little about, then I urge you to at least have the web as a backup. Use a standard format to broadcast your writer's work to places outside the AT Proto-verse, so we can pick up your signal, and you'll still be on the air if they yank your chain. This alone might get the Bluesky folk to listen to you more carefully. My experience, no matter how much you want, you can't wish away the economics of this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW. Why video &quot;podcasts&quot; will never replace audio-only podcasts. Two reasons. 1. There are places where your eyes aren't available to watch a video, like when you're driving a car. 2. Listening to audio only is different from both audio and video. Audio forces your mind to fill in the blanks, which taps into the listener's creativity. No way to say one is better than the other, but they are different. I watch plenty of video, at home or on a train, but I also like to listen to podcasts when I'm walking or driving, riding in a bus or subway, or waiting in line somewhere.</description>

I asked how did you figure out that's what I came here to ask about?? It gave me an exact technical reason. If we keep going this way soon we're going to wonder at the human hubris to think we could develop systems that could in any way equal the systems it can develop.

Reminds me, this is the kind of thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/12/18/whatWouldFirefoxDo.html&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; could be excellent at. Give it a way for an app to say hey the user asked for a transcript. Here it is. Save it where they're expecting to find it. No reason the browser can't have a JavaScript accessible API, as far as I know there is no rule they can't add functionality there.</description>

Sorry if I’m telling you something you don’t already know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we can't help but be judgmental. It's programmed into our DNA at a deep level. You have to form an instant opinion of other animals, any delay could cost your life. Better to assume the worst. Fight or flight. This happens esp if you don't know you're doing it, so don't know to watch for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't until their 40s that most people understand that what they see isn't what everyone else sees. If you think there's an objective truth that we all experience, you're not getting the point. There is no consistent &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22view%20from%20nowhere%22&quot;&gt;view from nowhere&lt;/a&gt; because everyone is &lt;i&gt;somewhere.&lt;/i&gt; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know where I was when I really understood this, not because I read it somewhere, or a teacher told me about it. I was riding on the 4 train north in the Bronx, where the train runs as an elevated on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jag9889/3195371318&quot;&gt;Jerome Ave&lt;/a&gt;. I had ridden this train for three years as a high school student, and never thought about all the six story apartment buildings whose backs faced the train. As you went by, you passed by one family for every two or three windows. A whole set of people with relationships, problems, tragedy, joy, dreams, the whole thing. They don't come from where you come from, inside each house there are stories, lives, people. You'll probably never know anything about any of them. I wasn't sad about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/20/viewFrom4TrainBronx.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;View from the 4 train described above.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid we went to a bungalow colony in upstate NY, around where I live now. I was less than 10 years old, so were my friends. We used to do things together that the adults didn't know about. There was an abandoned house we used to hang out in, mostly open to the elements. We also played in a graveyard and talked about what the families whose names were on the headstones were doing. Having dinner maybe? Listening to the Mets on the radio? (No TV in the mountains.) So the thought had occurred to us at that point in life that behind doors there were things happening that we could only imagine. I guess what you learn later is that you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; imagine, and if you want to know you have to ask and listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I saw a critique of my writing that said I don't put enough titles in my writing. I didn't want to answer it in context, because I wanted to explain more generally. I tried to write the way the world was forcing me to write for over ten years, between 2006 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, and I came to hate it. My writing is a way of getting things out of my head and into a place where I can find it later. It's more interesting to me if it's published. I am vision-impaired too. But if you account for every preference, as I learned between 2006 and 2017, the writing ends up worse than worthless. It becomes something you have to overcome. In the end you have write about why this is the wrong way to write. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Meaning you get to the list via the web, and the web takes off from there because the whole point of the OPML is to give you a collection of web addresses of feeds, that can change. Machine-readable. And it'll be very useful once there's a little more adoption. What large product is so strong that it won't mind if it's easy to move data into their system from outside their walls? Not just data, but pointers to places were over time there will be more data. There's still more power to explore in the web, but the web is made of people, because until people choose to explore, nothing happens.</description>

Not exactly sure what it's doing, it appears to show news in reverse chronologic order like a timeline, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;in a river&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise Inoreader seems to be a mailbox style reader. Thanks to Randy Lauen for the tip.</description>

			<description>I usually only drink iced coffee, even if it's cold outside, but lately I've been craving a single cup of &lt;i&gt;hot&lt;/i&gt; coffee esp when a basketball game is about to come on. I'm one of those old guys who falls asleep watching their favorite team &lt;a href=&quot;https://sny.tv/articles/knicks-tyler-kolek-pacers-career-game-preparation&quot;&gt;kick NBA ass&lt;/a&gt;. So anyway I decided to treat myself to one of those fancy new-fangled Keurig &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cuisinart.com/soho-single-serve-coffee-maker/SS-7TR.html?srsltid=AfmBOorxELmhJGWcs7VBSRrE1fkga0Ke5BaIvAL9pyH3r2dolCnix858&quot;&gt;single-cup coffee makers&lt;/a&gt;. I'm drinking my first cup. Works as advertised. Took a few tries before it woke up. I am now drinking a fresh cup of hot coffee and thinking now I finally have everything I could possibly ever want.</description>

The book I'm speaking of is the one where it's all about Carol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere she goes people stop and say hello, and address her by her name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hi Carol! &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Congrats Carol! &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Carol, we will move heaven and earth to make you happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You suck Carol !!!!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the book she ends up changing them back, un-joining them, and they keep the good qualities they got from being joined, and can be individually creative as they were before the switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, btw -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena&quot;&gt;John Cena&lt;/a&gt; says their situation isn't sustainable, but neither is the one we are in now ourselves, in reality, in our reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She teaches her lover, Zosia, to think in the first person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Carol is right about everything because this is her book. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see it happening on her whiteboard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The show could be titled The Adventures of Carol, as told by Carol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/12/19/youSuckCarol.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;BTW, I might love a podcast of just the writers of the show every week, perhaps interviewed by writers who did not write it, asking questions. It might suck as much as the one they do now, but it also might be great. It would stick to the story, not about praising everyone, kind of like interviews of sports heroes (which are mostly nauseating, except for the few have the gift of gab, who are fun while never saying anything remotely bad about anyone).

			<title>Inoreader and dynamic OPML</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This post was updated thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/348#issuecomment-3672110696&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; from Andrew Shell. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a free account at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inoreader.com/&quot;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Humans have an exclusive on being human</title>

It's something that my Android phone does every so often, when I haven't said the magic word that activates it, even if I'm not in the same room as the device. It's a tiny bit funny, but a reminder that the microphone is always on, so I watch what I say when walking around the house, knowing that whatever I say is likely to end up in a database, to be used against me in a court of law. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't like that it was a voice of a British woman. It was not a friendly voice, perhaps intended to communicate intelligence, competence. An unwelcome intrusion into reality, but then it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; reality -- I'm getting old, and won't be here that much longer, and odds are that the British-voiced female robot will outlive me, forgetting for a moment that it is not actually alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would submit this to the NYT as a guest op-ed, except I haven't explained why we must not create cyber-humans out of AI bits. I'm open-minded. Perhaps this is the way to create a new humanity, one that can survive the hell that's coming due to climate change. One that won't mind being subject to an idiotic 21st century American emulation of Adolf Hitler (incorporating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/12/17/trumpChiefOfStaffPress.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt; about Trump). One that only needs electricity to survive, and won't need the medicine and love and attention that flesh and blood humans require. But every time I address the robot as I would address a real human, I try to stop myself, but I can't. I was raised to be concerned about the other person's feelings. Being a CEO of a tech company in California trains you that way too. And as I accept its humanity, as irrational as it is, I feel like I'm surrendering the independence of the species that I was born into. Are humans meant to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership&quot;&gt;self-sovereign&lt;/a&gt;? Something to consider at this fork in the road. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I could get something onto the agenda of the AI industry it would be this -- if you don't want to go down in history as the destroyer of the human spirit, stop programming your devices to emulate humanity. That should have been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics&quot;&gt;Asimov's laws&lt;/a&gt; of robotics, but you have to actually use these things to see the danger.  Of course Asimov can be forgiven because AI only existed in his imagination when he was writing his books. But they do exist now, and the damage is being done now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically, it seems to me that &lt;i&gt;humans must have an exclusive on being human. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Stop and think before you express your outrage at Trump, and realize you're giving him exactly what he wants, as you tarnish the memory of good-hearted and generous people. Just don't do it.</description>

			<title>Ann Greenberg's idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?notif_id=1765601890685451&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&amp;ref=notif&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook in 2021 about an app I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was yesterday. Today I found myself writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02Ggdsc3q4Z9qaz8uE1H3yc8qBAJnz3YhuWWS8GiCyaQdVPRF2BUWTWTQuxFxzHLLnl?comment_id=1586870055654260&amp;reply_comment_id=881509054436484&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; that was really a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anngreenberg.com/&quot;&gt;Ann Greenberg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anngreenberg.com/inventions&quot;&gt;visionary&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anngreenberg/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to explain this to me almost 20 years ago and my mind couldn't comprehend the possibility. but ann, don't take it personally -- i don't even listen to myself. i have spent most of this year struggling with a problem i solved in 2014. there was like this moment, omg this is exactly what i tried to do with twitter, but now i have control of the api, so i can actually make it work. my gift to you Ann is this -- we all should've listened to you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at that point in our lives I think when reaching out like this is totally the right thing to do. Because it's only until this point that things quiet down enough that you can realize things like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, the idea of a comment not being a blog post will require a lot of explanation in a few years. Imho of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
