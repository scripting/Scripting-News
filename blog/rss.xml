			<description>I want a new ChatGPT mode where I drive the work, not the bot. I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions. I call this &quot;behave like a computer, not a human.&quot; Because it's a fanstastic computer, but not a good partner.</description>

Then I realized that sometimes in software I'm climbing a cliff that's too tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything, because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a layer I can build on. Anyway I'm in the middle of one of those corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks like it might have. I'm being sure not to create another mess that needs to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I'd rather be doing anything but this. :-)</description>

I don't think I've ever said that on the blog before. I write my code in an outliner, and take advantage of its ability to collapse long comments into a single line. There are whole blogs at the top of some functions, notes about all the big changes in code, sometimes over years, and sometimes even decades of maintenance.  There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/source.opml&quot;&gt;source.opml&lt;/a&gt; in most of the repos with a big comment at the top explaining what's going on. Also, most projects have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md&quot;&gt;worknotes.md&lt;/a&gt; file, and where there are dates in the source code, the refer back to dates in the worknotes.md file. Not always, but most of the time. Some of the code is very complex, I work really hard to make it simple so it can be worked on, but in some cases it's impossible to make it read casually. But it's all there, all the tools I use to write the code.</description>

I still want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests of one person (me). My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; is this: &quot;Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information..&quot; The response was basically: &quot;I'm sorry Dave.&quot; Groan. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482&quot;&gt;the details&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Paul%20Boutin%22&quot;&gt;Paul Boutin&lt;/a&gt; who I know from early Wired days offers some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179622599&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; that it can be gotten to work, with a bit more guesswork, trial and error and head scratching. I probably will keep coming back to this until I break through. Or maybe hook up with another developer who can back into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;websocket hose&lt;/a&gt; coming out of FeedLand. It's a natural thing to hook up to AI systems.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;You're going to think this is crazy, but maybe we should do what the hippie kids did in the 60s and 70s, giving flowers to the new cops in DC. Start off saying we don't blame you, we'll give you the benefit of the doubt, let's all be Americans and remember what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/12/flowerPower.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_Power_(photograph)&quot;&gt;Flower power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Or if users get an idea for linking two products, they can do it with scripting. It was a dream we had for the Mac, but it fell apart because Apple wanted to control everything. I find it's better when developers are free to work with each other, without interference from a big company like Apple. That's why &quot;platform without a platform vendor&quot; was the most important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn't just work with other developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In one swoop we lost all the features listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; page. I am betting everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being before that and at the same time create a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, far beyond what Twitter and twitter-like systems can do.</description>

The interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/katrina-10-years-later-brownie-youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-job/4548480&quot;&gt;Brownie&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;i&gt;cringe&lt;/i&gt;-worthy not binge-worthy, I skipped over it." created="Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:14:46 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/10/bobby.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/08/10.html#a231446"/>

			<description>One more bingeable, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lights_(2023_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Blue Lights&lt;/a&gt; from BBC on HBO Max. I love police dramas, esp British ones. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Peaky Blinders&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Fall&lt;/a&gt;, another British crime drama, and, amazingly they all take place in Belfast, believe it or not, and don't count the number of times people say &quot;wee&quot; in the darndest places in BBC Belfast crime dramas. Do Brits really say &lt;i&gt;wee&lt;/i&gt; all the time? How did I not see that coming.</description>

			<title>It hasn't hit us yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Theory about why we don’t fight to save the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Many of us haven’t personally felt much impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No hyperinflation yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The police still respond as they always have, wearing badges, faces uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The shelves are full at the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The electricity is on, as is the internet. Buses and subways are running. The airports are open. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Obamas and Clintons are still free, living in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not felt yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we’ve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We’ve had no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn’t feel like anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a difference between reading a site in a web browser and it being part of the web. As it turns out what became Web 2.0, all built as silos, could more accurately be called Anti-web 2.0. Underneath all the silos, the heart of the web is still beating. Ready for us to build on it again.</description>

ChatGPT has real limits. This has to be done off on the side. It certainly could be done with their API. I'm head-down on other projects and can't do it myself but as I explain in the writeup, it would plug in beautifully to stuff I'm doing and it would all be open, so a new kind of feed reader is possible. And we could find news from other bloggers that the journalists aren't reporting on, the same way we relied on blogs in the early days to learn about what was going on on the web. It's time to do that again.</description>

			<title>I want the web to be like Harvard</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the beginning I wanted the web to be like Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's one of the reasons I went there as a research fellow in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't satisfied with the web, the density of minds wasn't up to my expectations, so I thought if I brought the web to the minds, that might work better. I wanted to work on communication systems for people trying to work together to solve big problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I chose Harvard over MIT, because the web was already strong at MIT, and they weren't friendly to my cause, they were busy trying to reinvent the web when it imho didn't need that. I hoped instead, Harvard, more a school of the liberal arts, would be more open to innovation in communication between people as opposed to between machines. I felt, in 2003, that was a solved problem on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It didn't happen there either, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; did come out of that period, and some of it was lasting, but eventually the university wasn't on board with the web as a community for intellect. Instead what came out of Harvard in that period was Facebook, which is a great accomplishment. I am a FB user to this day and appreciate how well it works at keeping friends from long ago in contact. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still want an intellectual community on the web. That's why I'm putting so much effort into rebuilding it as a writing environment. All this because the writing products of Silicon Valley are always will be silos. As heroic as Ghost has been in supporting ActivityPub that is not the web. The barriers are too high and the features too limited. The web is the web, it's well defined and well understood. And that's where we have to go, and I want the minds to be there or else it wasn't worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>UI in AI is the next frontier</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/08/07/rickAndMorty.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/08/07/chatgpt-5-is-even-more-of-a-bastard-than-4/&quot;&gt;quick review&lt;/a&gt; of ChatGPT 5, after trying a simple programming exercise with it. It was an awful collaboration because it lied to me about its capabilities, leading me to develop a feature in my software to support the capability that it later admitted that it didn't have. I've never had a programming partner do that to me. I've had people who never showed up for work. Or people who were in so far over their heads that it would have been better if they had never shown up. It lied repeatedly, and when cornered it had the audacity to gaslight me. &quot;I understand why you feel that way.&quot; Oh nothing pisses me off more than that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/250807/p29#a250807p29&quot;&gt;other people&lt;/a&gt; don't review it based on its functionality, after all it isn't just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/02/big-tech-ai-spending?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;&gt;money sink&lt;/a&gt;, or a technological breakthrough, it's software that we pay actual money for that is meant to help us in our work. I don't know if it's by design that it's such an asshole. I have a feeling that people are going to focus on this eventually. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is not human, it's like the world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Rick%20and%20Morty%22&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/a&gt;. And we're meant to be one of the many versions of Rick and/or Morty, but which is the real one? Before we lose sight of that, let's keep our heads on, we're still the ones discovering stuff and being creative and entertaining other humans, not the machines. It'll all work a lot better when they're programmed to behave like computers, not these vain and corrupt pseudo humans. Still a breakthrough in search. Really sticks it to Google. Yaaay. That's good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm more worried about AIs killing us by overwhelming our nervous systems than taking our place at work. Has anyone actually used any of the software an AI has written? I know people who have never written software before are in awe, as I am about &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; characters I make up, but how does the software it builds rate? If it lies to itself like it lies to me, the software doesn't work at all, even slightly. I'm pretty sure &quot;garbage in garbage out&quot; applies in the new world of software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/09.html#a191740&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'd love to understand how one can be a programmer and not always be searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can think of, ours depends on telling the truth. You can't lie to a compiler is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tech industry doesn't get its relationship with paying human customers. Had a problem with my cell phone service. I started getting emails saying it was shutting off my service because my credit card was being denied. Went to the account on the web and it looked fine. The messages kept coming.

We still don't know how many accounts I have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The company is Google. They're good at dealing with imaginary customers not real ones. If they ever understood how to communicate with people, they have forgotten. And of course there's a real possibility that all my conversations were with &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; ChatGPT.

It was an awful collaboration because it lied to me about its capabilities, leading me to develop a feature in my software to support the capability that it later admitted that it didn't have. I've never had a programming partner do that to me. I've had people who never showed up for work. Or people who were in so far over their heads that it would have been better if they had never shown up. It lied repeatedly, and when cornered it had the audacity to gaslight me. &quot;I understand why you feel that way.&quot; Oh nothing pisses me off more than that." created="Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:40:45 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/08/07/rickAndMorty.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/08/08/125302.html#a124045"/>

			<description>New version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;feedlandSocket&lt;/a&gt;. It's now an NPM package you can include in Node projects. The demo is more useful, and there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q-ks3uytZI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of what it looks like as it scrolls through the JavaScript console. WebSockets + feeds. A fairly important component of an open social web system.</description>

			<description>I recorded a good podcast yesterday about how I develop new stuff like podcasting, and how it only works if there isn't a huge dominant platform vendor to FUD the project. That's why RSS worked, sort of -- we did get FUDded by the RDF folk, who had a few famous people on their list of co-authors, and it put a big scar on RSS when it was just starting to grow. We cleaned up their mess after a while, and then it boomed, thanks to the New York Times. This is what usually happens, in markets that are controlled by a big company. Google has that effect, so does Apple as does the W3C. They force everything to stop and go through a process that simply doesn't work, it doesn't yield innovation in the market, because it wasn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/10/howToBootstrapFederated140.html&quot;&gt;bootstrapped&lt;/a&gt;.  That's why I don't like the idea of &quot;Podcasting 2.0&quot; whatever it is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@adam@podcastindex.social/114978962778121264&quot;&gt;Adam Curry says&lt;/a&gt; on Masto that it's all a big misunderstanding, but that's what the RDF people said too. Who cares what the name is. Everyone cares, when it comes to the name of a standard or protocol. And when you have an Apple or Google or IETF  trying to confuse people about what you're doing, well you can't make any progress on interop. They freeze everything because users and developers will wait for them. Of course that's what &quot;Podcasting 2.0&quot; is all about. To make all the ideas flow through &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasting2.org/&quot;&gt;one place&lt;/a&gt;. And whoever they are (ChatGPT &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/07/isTherePodcastingTwoPointOh.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's Adam Curry btw) they didn't even bring the power of an Apple or Google to the table. They have nothing other than their aspiration to own the name of an open format and protocol that made the world a little happier for a while. For that of course someone has to try to own it. That's basically what I said, in a very long-winded way, in the podcast. I also talked about ways we could move forward anyway even though there is a 800-pound would-be gorilla trying to own our playground. Maybe I'll just release the podcast as-is and ask you all to indulge me for my need to say the same thing far too many times with so much vigor. :-)</description>

That's why I spruced up &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.opml.org/&quot;&gt;lists.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;, that's how we're connecting our servers. He's building this stuff to flow into his LLM via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;FeedLand websockets interface&lt;/a&gt;. He'll be updated on my subscriptions, and have his own, and the news will flow into his AI system. All of it can emanate from anywhere RSS is supported with a focus on WordPress.

It needs to become more invisible, there's no suspension of disbelief when you're working with it. I think we can do much better at finding a robot that can really augment human intelligence. This is awful stuff. We have to work on these dynamics.</description>

			<description>Whenever you have to get something done with a company, get ready for lots of phone tag, waiting on hold, talking to bots, getting screened, trying to convince a computer that you have legitimate business, and no, what you're looking for isn't on their website (believe me I looked). The stupid thing about it is that ChatGPT is becoming more like those things every day. Companies have built awful systems for getting anything done that might eat into their profits. Google is the absolute worst. Even for services that cost real money, they absolutely will not help. You better hope everything goes perfectly if you buy their service.</description>

			<description>Since the govt is no longer funding NPR maybe they could stop bending over for the Repubs. Lay it all out there, stop spinning all the crazy fascist authoritarianism as both-sides and normal partisan politics. They know we're in a lot deeper.

			<title>Antisemitism is everywhere</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Academics, who speak scientific language, won't say &quot;there's no antisemitism at UCLA&quot; because they know that's not true. Antisemitism is everywhere. The question is how limiting and dangerous is it. And how often is it encountered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the 1960s in a Queens neighborhood where antisemitism was a real thing. We were blamed for World War II. If it weren't for Jews my uncle Pete would still be alive. That was the story. No doubt the kids heard that at home. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism was bred into us at home. Because of all the abuse my parents and grandparents, uncles and cousins, suffered in Europe, before coming the US during the war, their own idea of what it meant to be Jewish was not entirely positive. You can't help but feel responsible in some ways for the abuse you suffer. And you can't help but pass that on to your kids. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was and is a fair amount of pain associated with being Jewish in the United States. Fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But: At UCLA? Harvard? Columbia? Please.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the same time scientists can admit that there is antisemitism at these places we must also acknowledge that to single these institutions out among all, is complete utter total fucking bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a scientific appraisal, btw. Provable in peer-reviewed publications (though not submitted).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism is complex. We should be hearing, openly, what exactly the case is against these universities. The government is theoretically representing the Constitution and the people of the United States. The old &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/a&gt;. Let's hear the case in clear terms, and why the universities are supposedly so bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>As you get older your memory gets less reliable. It makes programming more of a challenge because as your software gets more features, there's more to remember and at the same time you're getting older. I wonder if there isn't some way to use ChatGPT to augment the aging mind dealing with more software complexity. It's very much in line with the idea I've had for a long time of putting all my writing in an AI database so I could then ask it to edit it down to book length. Or get a table of contents of what I think and then be able to read chapter-length sections on, say platforms, or how important prior art is, or what interop makes possible, and why everyone should give back when they take from open ecosystems. Each one of those topics has lots of associated stories over the years, but I probably couldn't find most of them, but an AI database certainly could. How to set that up? I've not figured that out so far.</description>

			<description>One of the more depressing things in having so much code that I can easily search, is the number of times I've rewritten the same code without remembering I had written it before. Yesterday I did it knowingly, I wanted a function that could tell me if one of a set of categories applies to a WordLand draft. So I could say &quot;don't list drafts with 'linkblog' as a category.&quot; It could have other categories, and there could be more than one category to exclude. I wanted to take the time to write perfect code for this one problem. Not dense, not particularly efficient. No matter how inefficient the code is, on today's hardware such a function couldn't use any time at all. It's fair to say I've solved this problem before, but there was always more to it. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/d61110c1d74eb1162ebc726c09dd22f1&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;. Now you know something about what I think is readable, understandable, respectful of a human more than I am of the computer. I know the computer would come up with much more dense and tricky code, but it doesn't have a mind, and I do. At times it can be relaxing, I magine, to not have a mind. And btw, in a couple of years this layer of code will be obsolete. We already are able to tell the machine how to do this in human language, it understands what we mean. One tiny little but hugely significant breakthrough made possible by ChatGPT and its cousins.</description>

			<description>A basic question I had about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent&quot;&gt;ChatGPT agents&lt;/a&gt; that I can answer now that I have the feature, is whether or not the code you create can run on a server, where you can give it a URL and make it an endpoint other networked software can call. Or if it could run periodically, say once every five minutes for a function that was creating an RSS feed anyone could subscribe to. The answer is no -- it can't do either of these things. I'm sure they could do it at a technical level, but they don't want to host applications. But now I may understand better why they want to make a web browser, I bet you will be able to call these agents from apps that run in the browser. And in their case, they might not even have to support JavaScript? Heh. A wholly different programming model? Maybe I'm overestimating how much they're biting off? I wonder if anyone at OpenAI reads this blog and might want to get me in a tighter loop, so I can be among the first to try new features like this, rather than, in this case, among the very last.</description>

			<source:outline text="A basic question I had about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent&quot;&gt;ChatGPT agents&lt;/a&gt; that I can answer now that I have the feature, is whether or not the code you create can run on a server, where you can give it a URL and make it an endpoint other networked software can call. Or if it could run periodically, say once every five minutes for a function that was creating an RSS feed anyone could subscribe to. The answer is no -- it can't do either of these things. I'm sure they could do it at a technical level, but they don't want to host applications. But now I may understand better why they want to make a web browser, I bet you will be able to call these agents from apps that run in the browser. And in their case, they might not even have to support JavaScript? Heh. A wholly different programming model? Maybe I'm overestimating how much they're biting off? I wonder if anyone at OpenAI reads this blog and might want to get me in a tighter loop, so I can be among the first to try new features like this, rather than, in this case, among the very last." created="Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:40:05 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/08/03.html#a134005"/>
