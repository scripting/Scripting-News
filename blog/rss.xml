I usually write my prompts very carefully, esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring, and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was repetetive and had an error I didn't bother to correct, to see what would happen. It didn't even criticize me. It figured out what I was trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep finding miracles in this tech.</description>

			<title>Cross-posting in 2024</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called &quot;legacy.&quot; The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The items in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I want broader distribution, I do this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open a new browser window.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I write some text into the Twitter tab.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Paste an image if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see one of these support the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I support the students</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;As a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support today's students making their political opinions heard. I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Random RSS &amp; ActivityPub notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, &quot;they don't really mean it.&quot; This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage&quot;&gt;umbrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt; of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a &quot;standard&quot; and thus was born Atom. My opinion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;one way is better&lt;/a&gt; than two, and they should have jumped on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to do that. It isn't going away. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. &quot;I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.&quot; I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1&quot;&gt;ChatGPT gave&lt;/a&gt; what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; is a product of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut&quot;&gt;Architecture Astronauts&lt;/a&gt;. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521&quot;&gt;need a BDG asap&lt;/a&gt;, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical &quot;busy developer.&quot; I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5&quot;&gt;you can't lie to a compiler&lt;/a&gt; axiom. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is letting us customize the context in which our queries run. So I can say I use JavaScript so if I ask a programming question, it should answer in that language. I was happy to have this feature, and gave it a thumbs up. The idea is that we build up a highly detailed profile over time, so ChatGPT gets better at answering my questions. And it also locks us in. It didn't come up for me until Meta.ai came along and sometimes it's good to get a second opinion. But I want to share that profile info.</description>

He sat out most of the fourth quarter, was put back in at the very end and took the last Sixers desperation shot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the other big Eastern Division game on Thursday, why did Doc Rivers, the Milwaukee Bucks' coach go into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_time&quot;&gt;garbage time&lt;/a&gt; when the Bucks were down by only 10 with 2.5 minutes remaining? What the frack was he thinking? Deficits like that are often made up, esp in elimination games? Being a good sport is one thing, but quitting the season early when you're only down by 10? What the what? I tuned in the game at the point when his stars were coming out, before the Knicks game started, and couldn't figure out why he was giving up so soon?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It couldn't actually happen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the pause between the first and second rounds of the NBA playoffs, I am having the very very very strange thought that maybe possibly maybe the Knicks will could possibly maybe perhaps nah never hmm -- go all the way?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

And Doc Searls, who is also a Knicks fan, now lives in Indiana, so he is somewhat justified in believing the world revolves around him. I've always had that sense about Doc.</description>

			<description>BTW, there are plenty of relatively low priced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stubhub.com/indiana-pacers-indianapolis-tickets-5-10-2024/event/152902691/?quantity=2&quot;&gt;tickets available&lt;/a&gt; at the Pacers arena for the May 10 game when the playoff heads to Indiana. This is one of the Knicks fans' favorite tactics. Since there are so many New Yorkers, spread out all over the country, and we're pretty much all Knicks fans, this can create a demoralizing effect for the opposition players who assume their hometown crowd will be rooting for them, not the other team. It had a pretty adverse effect on the Sixers a few days ago. I was chatting about this with fellow Knicks fan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=NakedJen&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; during last night's harrowing game, and said this might be a good tactic somehow in the election, if every time the opposition had a rally they discovered that most of the attendees were actually in favor of democracy and abortion rights.</description>

			<title>The soundtrack of your life</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've developed new appreciation for two musicians from my generation: George Harrison and Bob Dylan, thanks to the encouragement of two friends, both of whom have links to my childhood believe it or not, but who are current friends in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dotage&quot;&gt;dotage&lt;/a&gt; and they're both on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my first friend said she likes &lt;a href=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison&quot;&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; the best of all the Beatles, and I thought that's weird because it really was down to Paul and John, I thought -- and then I heard this interview with George asking why he didn't explain in his memoir how he worshipped John as a kid, and George took exception, saying yeah in John's mind that's who I am, a kid who worshipped him, which I never did (says George). So now I have gone back through his music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others, and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980). And he was never going to be taken seriously by the others, so he had to get out of there to have the creative life he wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;About Dylan, the credit goes to my local friend and &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/song-173-all-along-the-watchtower-part-one-hes-not-the-messiah/&quot;&gt;Andrew Hickey&lt;/a&gt;, who focused my attention on the &lt;i&gt;music&lt;/i&gt; of Dylan's songs, when I had only been focusing on the lyrics. Silly of me. He only ever wanted to be seen as a musician, not a leader of anything, and that's where the difficulty came from, and why I wasn't really interested, even though I had listened to all the Dylan songs many times, and had a few of his albums growing up. So I just played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled_Up_in_Blue&quot;&gt;Tangled Up in Blue&lt;/a&gt; and realized this has been rolling around in my mind for days, and I wasn't even aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower&quot;&gt;All Along the Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; (another Dylan song) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;, which I just heard is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's time for another binge of that. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, two doors open, and that's always good. You know this is why you pick your music when you're young and stay with it, because it's the soundtrack of your life, and it has new relevance at every step of your evolution. Sure I listen to other music, but -- it's the songs that were big when I was little that matter most. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What became of 1999.io</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: It's gone -- you can't get &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two apps I miss the most. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;1999 was a rewrite&lt;/a&gt; of blogging software from the point of view of both 1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close. When I realized they weren't going to do it, I set out to do it myself, how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn't have their source code, so I built it from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn't use it. I also couldn't use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version of the Mac OS. It's made me think that maybe in a few years or even months you might not be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. Then I thought about how I can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you depend on should go off the air. See the next post, below.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Protecting your FeedLand subscription lists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, you should keep a current backup copy of your subscription list. It's very easy to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;i&gt;My feed list&lt;/i&gt; in the first menu.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the page.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This is the format that all feed reading software understands. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In your browser, choose the &lt;i&gt;Save Page As&lt;/i&gt; command in the File menu (or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along with your other backups.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription list in localStorage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And if the FeedLand server you're using should happen to disappear, if you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you'll at least have a copy in localStorage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you want to see it -- visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console, and enter this line:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you have questions, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you're a blogger, here's something to think about. Whose writing influenced the way you write? Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker&quot;&gt;Russell Baker&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland&quot;&gt;Douglas Coupland&lt;/a&gt; (specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;MicroSerfs&lt;/a&gt;), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software.</description>

			<description>My father taught me how to organize my thinking when I was trying to figure out how something works. And that's basically what I've spent my life on, figuring out how things work. The most interesting and gratifying was understanding things that didn't exist until I pieced their story together.</description>

It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;local TV&lt;/a&gt; with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier&quot;&gt;Walt Clyde Frazier&lt;/a&gt;. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms&quot;&gt;narration&lt;/a&gt; is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/&quot;&gt;Archie Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. I keep wanting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I do not think it means what you think it means,&quot; but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=nba+schedule&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;&quot;&gt;next game&lt;/a&gt;. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?</description>

			<description>When I log on to meta.ai, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/suggestions.png&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; are the suggestions. None of them relate to things I'm thinking about. I haven't been a student or interviewed for a job in decades. But I've been on Facebook for many years, and I had to connect this to my Facebook account to use it, so presumably it knows all that Facebook knows about me, about me. How long before this is customized?</description>

			<description>I'm looking for a quick and easy and ideally free way to upload an MP3 of a podcast and get back a transcript. I have a feeling that a podcast I recorded yesterday will work better as a written document, but I don't have the patience to transcribe it myself. I asked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1785442296466747624&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3krf2vjg3nk2w&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112362620201313010&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C6Zy6uyJRz1&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/32dce589-58c8-498b-85bd-c1f9a2c1b892&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meta.ai/c/6b8ecc0f-2163-4162-aa48-67e32f4260cc&quot;&gt;Meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
