			<description>I went skiing today at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain&quot;&gt;Belleayre&lt;/a&gt;. First time in five years. It was great. I've been working out to get ready for it, and was concerned maybe I'm finally too old, but it's good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if you can. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belleayre.com/mountain/trail-map-and-mountain-stats/&quot;&gt;trail map&lt;/a&gt; and some stats on the area.</description>

			<description>Social networks and RSS. We really should be on the case for all social media networks to support RSS feeds outbound at least (inbound nice too). And also add features to make interop really useful. I've enumerated them &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am making software that builds on this feature in social networks. And yes we do have some examples of that, thinking of WordPress and competitors. I think they are perfectly good bases for social networks.</description>

			<description>This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kteare/post/C2-MHcJL1L5&quot;&gt;first pitch&lt;/a&gt; I’ve heard for the Apple goggles that actually makes me want to buy a pair. If there were an Apple Store nearby I probably would have already gotten it.</description>

			<description>I'm reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Oath-Honor-Warning-Liz-Cheney/dp/0316572063&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney's book&lt;/a&gt;, and forgot something I had guessed during the insurrection. While it was going on Trump was calling Congresspeople saying if you stop the count I'll call off the attack. In other words, trade your life for a vote. I suspected it before, but they have testimony that verifies it.</description>

			<description>I'm doing some writing about writing and finding the phrase &quot;RSS, Atom and RFD&quot; too cumbersome. Most people don't care and see the distinctions as unnecessary. But I want to be accurate, and recognize that while RSS is the most-used kind of feed, there are others, and our software works with them. I'm trying this construction: &quot;RSS-compatible.&quot; I think that expresses the most important point, the choice of format is up to you, but now, by 2024, they all work pretty much the same way.</description>

			<description>Good morning. The main static server I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/05.html#a143645&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; yesterday has been relocated to a fresh, new and apparently healthy server to perform its past duties.

			<description>feedland.org runs on a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean server&lt;/a&gt;, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size relatively small scale server that can't expand, and the latter is designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of 2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment.</description>

			<description>If you're creating something new, definitely create it on feedland.com. If you're already using feedland.org, for now you're welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving useful to have around, so I don't imagine it'll go away, it's much easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based server.</description>

			<description>BTW, while we're doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a combination of software that suddenly aren't getting along with each other. Obviously something changed. I'm running it in a somewhat crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of the downsides of having fun with server software.</description>

			<description>One of the cool things about being a programmer is that you can decide to run code that you know has zero chance of working. &quot;Let all hell break loose,&quot; a programmer can be heard to say quietly before clicking the Run button. Very few design professions get to do this, I imagine, unless they're psychotic.</description>

			<description>People are really gushing about the Apple goggles, now that they have them in their hands. I still can't get psyched about it. I was late to getting an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/10/1175.html&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and now I &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/03/appleWatch2024.png&quot;&gt;wear it&lt;/a&gt; every day, can't imagine not wearing it. So maybe I will get one eventually. But my vision is weak, and I kind of doubt it'll work for me. And I would much prefer if Apple had poured their vast resources and creativity into making mass transport work in the Bay Area instead, as a prototype for what might be possible in the rest of the world. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; I would cheer, unconditionally.</description>

And I would much prefer if Apple had poured their vast resources and creativity into making mass transport work in the Bay Area instead, as a prototype for what might be possible in the rest of the world. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; I would cheer, unconditionally." created="Sat, 03 Feb 2024 21:06:08 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/02/03.html#a210608"/>

			<title>Too late for LeBron in NY</title>

If they did that, I don't think I could ever see myself as a Knicks fan again. It would be the most serious form of betrayal, and would show that the management has no freaking clue about NY basketball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We don't mind that the Knicks haven't won a championship since 1973. Obviously we don't mind, or we would not have suffered through all the bozo-osity of the owner and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson#New_York_Knicks_(2014%E2%80%932017)&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; he hires. We love this team, and we especially love the 2024 version of the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last trade was the best ever, even though we had to say goodbye to Quickley, knowing he never really got a chance to shine in NY. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;LBJ&lt;/a&gt; on the Knicks in 2024 would be a terrible fit. About ten times worse the KD on the Nets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2024/02/vision-pro-first-impressions/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2024/02/rowing-to-alcatraz/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; last night. I asked friends at Automattic if it's my imagination or is Matt blogging a lot more now than he used to and they say yes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Matt is a good writer, it turns out. I read his posts as he dealt with the Tumblr situation, which was evolving quickly in real time at the end of last year. You can tell he's done a lot of this, relating to users and developers. I was going to say I've never led a community as large as his, but that's not exactly true. In general people don't treat you very well if you're at the top of something large, esp if they don't pay anything for it, it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Watching him deal with it has made me question the idea of me making software for other people. There was a brief period between 2017 and 2021 that I only made software for myself, and I liked that a lot, but it has the downside that the ideas have little chance of surviving to influence others. So as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; approached, I convinced myself to try one more time. Now this morning, in the middle of a pretty huge transition for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, that's been going slowly and confusingly, and is far from done, I realize that such a major upheaval in an already-deployed server-based product, is really asking for trouble. I feel it in my digestive system, as I used to when I was a kid and internalized all the stress from home life. I'm feeling that stress in a way I haven't felt in a long time. So I think this is the last time I do this. My next product will be a writer's tool and will largely run on the user's machine, and have a small server component, by design, with software that's been well burned-in. I'm not worried about that. And it's okay, because I really think this is the last big corner-turn that FeedLand will need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I probably should write a post explaining what this change is about, or at least record a podcast. If you want to see the details, it's all there in the narrated work &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/56&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. And I will continue to post there until the transition is complete. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning, while I'm waiting for the last query to run, I'm looking through the old sites on the other server (mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/02/02.html#a162816&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;) and have been looking through various archives I'm carrying with me, including the book my father wrote called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbatoolbox.org/&quot;&gt;MBA Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;. It's a responsibility I feel, and I often think I should modernize the site. It's got the look of a Manila site from the late 90s or early 00s. But it doesn't look all that bad, and he did all the work himself, so this is the way he wanted it to look. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I noted from his Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that Matt was born 15 days before the Mac was announced, an event we celebrated the 40th anniversary of last month, which adds up because Matt celebrated his 40th birthday a few days before all that. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: It turns out we were closer than I thought when I wrote this piece this morning. By noon, the server was updated, the software had been modified to work with the new database schema, and it re-opened to users. What I thought initially would take a few hours took 1.5 days. Once the corner was turned, I took a nap, watched some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman&quot;&gt;Bojack Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, am going to do a Peloton and then watch the Knicks, and I'm starting to feel human again. Whew. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The work is narrated in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/56&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what the snag was. We were low on storage starting at the beginning and eventually we ran out of space, and the error messages we got indicated the problem was something else. All the searching we did, none of the hits, or ChatGPT suggested looking at memory usage. Quite independently after thrashing around trying various theories, we finally got a message from the Digital Ocean service saying the server was out of space. When I doubled the space, that gave it enough room to do the tasks we had for it. Now running the last query. Looks like we may be over the hump. Let's just pray the software runs when we turn the server back on. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I have a server that handles all my old sites, and it needs to be replaced, so I'm trying to figure out where to put all the sites. Most are really small, 10 or fewer files. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://outline.land/treefun&quot;&gt;outline.land/treefun&lt;/a&gt; was large and interesting, so I thought I'd put a link here. I have forgotten so many of my little experiments.</description>

			<title>Cats are people too!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cats are on the march in NYC, on 8th Ave between 57th and 45th streets. Thousands of cats carrying signs and handing out leaflets saying 'Cats are people too!' and 'Up with Cats!' -- they are angry but there's a sense of celebration in the march, that finally the time has come for cats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first version had one of the themes as &quot;Down with Dogs!&quot; but ChatGPT rejected that as not being nice enough. So I changed it to &quot;Up with Cats!&quot; Please keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/02/catsRUs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Cats are marching on 8th Ave&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A bunch of new networks are forming, and they will melt into one, following a pattern established by the internet itself, when they formed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&quot;&gt;net of nets&lt;/a&gt; based on a common protocol called TCP. On top of that HTTP was built, with a number of years following with very productive building and bootstrapping, and from there it was a lot of chaos, around the advent of Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader. The last time we had a common way of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; was 17 years ago. I think/hope we're incentivized to make one edit box suffice, in place of the 5-10 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14.html#a145854&quot;&gt;tiny little textboxes&lt;/a&gt; we now all have to copy-paste between, and btw one way of addressing nodes, and then we can start building again as we did last in the 90s and 00s. I see something brilliant in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057231/iconfactory-kickstarter-internet-reader-project-tapestry-twitterrific&quot;&gt;new path&lt;/a&gt; that Twitteriffic wants to go down (I gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; $128). It's same path I've been going down, mostly without partners, for the 17 years since we crawled on land and started tweeting. I don't see the negative shit that's happening on Twitter, it's easy to avoid the mess -- I don't think that's the reason we're breaking out of that silo -- it's that all at once all the devs who had been quietly suffering with Twitter were set free. Boom. All at once. And it turns out perhaps we don't give up so easily. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Bard does pics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Google's Bard now does pictures. I asked for thousands of cats marching on 8th Ave in NYC between 57th St and 45th St. A very different style from what ChatGPT would have drawn and I like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/catsOnEighth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Cats on 8th Ave.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What's up at Harvard?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this note to Chris Lydon re the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/&quot;&gt;latest episode&lt;/a&gt; of his podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chris,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm listening to your latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/&quot;&gt;podcast about Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, and totally appreciate this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In my two years at Harvard in the 00s, I never:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. Experienced antisemitism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. Saw antisemitism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;3. Even thought about the &lt;i&gt;possibility&lt;/i&gt; of antisemitism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the Harvard campus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That said, antisemitism is everywhere, even inside me, a man whose grandparents were Jews who fled for their lives with their children from the Holocaust before and during WWII. I am a product of that, in ways I didn't even realize until my parents were gone. It's everywhere, all around, inside myself, inside everyone, and the best we can hope for imho is that it will stay hidden. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ask me about what happened in the NBA with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kyrie&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/a&gt;, and how, by their silence, the players and coaches showed how huge and deep the problem is.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To see the Repubs monetize this for political gain is par for the course. To see Harvard buckle under that, is weak and the people who made that decision imho should resign in disgrace. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for your continued and unique excellence. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
