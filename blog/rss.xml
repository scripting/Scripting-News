			<description>I'm highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a quick look indicates that it's a fairly large project. All I want to do is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There's no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I'm going to have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>For people who use &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. If you accidentally close a file that's open and want it to re-appear in its previous position, you can edit your prefs.json file. You can find it by choosing &lt;i&gt;Open Data Folder&lt;/i&gt; from the File menu. You'll see prefs.json. Open it in a text editor, and make the changes you want -- carefully. Probably a good idea to make a copy of the file before editing. But I just did it and laughed out loud, why didn't I think of this before? Heh.</description>

			<title>Twenty years ago today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM&quot;&gt;June 11, 2004&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me, it's June &lt;i&gt;2024&lt;/i&gt; now, it's been &lt;i&gt;twenty freaking years&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and it's still as open as it was back in June 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast&lt;/b&gt;. That was the goal. You don't need anyone's permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less real and less interesting, imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My partner in this at the time was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry&quot;&gt;Adam Curry&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime in that period he started &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code&quot;&gt;The Daily Source Code&lt;/a&gt;, and then we did a podcast together for a few months called &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. My own podcast was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months, with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows. I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew, Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine won't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the URL for the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck. I'll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I'll register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that's still thriving twenty years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should be quite a story! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004. And that's the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in Seattle at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/gnomedexDaveAdam.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Dave and Adam at Gnomedex in 2004.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The creativity of ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the creativity of ChatGPT, some call it hallucinations, but maybe all the rest of this stuff is hallucinating, maybe only ChatGPT sees what's real? Could be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the prompt: &quot;PODCAST0 from Dave Winer with occasional appearances by Adam Curry, all original 2004 podcasts, the very first podcasts in the galaxy, and possibly the universe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/allthepodcasts.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;All the original 2004 podcasts. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When I started the project, I had no idea what I'd find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don't know the extent of it, but there's a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I'm thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I'm beginning to see the utility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; as a feed operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It's not just a feed reader. It's able to do things most feed readers don't do, maybe none do. We don't have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either. I will of course share the results when they are shareable.</description>

			<description>Three movies I've watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The Matrix. 3. The Devil's Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they go together. And they're all about the same thing, about choosing to live in a dream, or to live the life you're actually living. All three are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to end, which is really unusual for me these days.</description>

			<title>Imagine RSS as a cover story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; has never been on the cover of a magazine, so you can't say ChatGPT is stealing this from anyone. In fact I'm offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press has chosen to focus on the idea that it's plagiarizing journalists. The ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they're doing their jobs, they're reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series&quot;&gt;NLCS&lt;/a&gt;. I don't owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I read the news on their site. The news doesn't belong to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn't so far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no billionaires involved, so they didn't consider it newsworthy I guess. Some day we're going to have to accept that we have to make our own news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker's famous line -- &quot;If you don't like the news go out and make some of your own.&quot; So here we go. I asked ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/16/imagineTheyPutRSSOnACover.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Imagine RSS as the cover story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read printed magazines?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It shows up on their home screen as the default channel and it starts playing automatically. For some reason they've decided need to watch Fox News. Please stop doing that. Not just for me, for everyone. If there has to be a default make it something easy like Seinfeld perhaps. Or Law &amp; Order. I haven't switched from Spectrum, I'm trying YouTube TV while I think about switching. This is a small thing, but might be a deal-stopper. I don't want my nose rubbed in how evil they are. I know. I want to turn on TV to escape. A Julie Andrews movie perhaps.</description>

I don't think anyone is listening, but my issue with the Times is when they embrace and promote conspiracy theories that damage our political system. Matt says we have many truths, and I think that's where we differ, there has to be one truth when it comes to accusations of the kind that the Repubs throw at Democratic candidates and minorities. When they take a side against the people, that's when I have a problem.</description>

			<title>A great political ad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay it's not the best political ad ever but it's pretty freaking good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We love America and the flag stands for the good in us, in all of us. And our president not only gets that, he is doing what presidents are supposed to do, unite us. To the extent that we can at this time be united. But even a MAGA, viewing this ad, is going to have to swell up with pride for what this country means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VC2SshZ373M?si=CV1-O9liPDmIhQRN&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I have a question for my campaign friend and politics rabbi -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/that-trippi-show/id1523896927&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. Joe, why don't they ask for a contribution at the end? I'd pay money specifically to have that ad run everywhere, even in states we have no chance of winning. Because there are people in every state that deserve encouragement, and if we want to really win we need them to feel part of our great country as much as anyone in a swing state. And there's always value in forcing the opposition to campaign in states they otherwise feel are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So let me -- a regular citizen -- earmark a contribution for &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; message. It gives me another way to vote, a sense I'm participating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription lists&lt;/a&gt; back in the 00s that it included the &lt;i&gt;htmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute, it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I'm using a SQL database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I thought &quot;no big deal&quot; it's a variant of a SQL table I've now done a dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I've yet to come up with a way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at runtime. That's how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be factored. This probably doesn't make sense to too many people, maybe it won't even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I've moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I'm sure it's possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of them, which is why I'm taking my break from &lt;i&gt;The Next Product&lt;/i&gt; to do this.</description>

			<description>It's not much of a secret that my next product is the minimal writing tool I always felt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; should have. I have not been doing this in conjunction with Automattic, I'm not sure we're on the same planet re what WordPress is for. Ultimately it'll be their decision if this idea gains traction. But I keep hearing people ask for this product, and I think it's the reason Substack and Ghost have become popular. I'm going to put it out there, and see what comes back. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, I love the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot;&gt;margin image&lt;/a&gt; of NakedJen. Talking with her the other day we decided this would be the opening scene of The NakedJen Movie. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xqiu0ekahw&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt; of the image is well-known to people who travel with the Dead, as Jen did. I've never been to a Dead concert with her, but I understand it's like going to a Comdex or MacWorld in the 80s or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricklin.com/albums/pcforum99/&quot;&gt;Esther's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/digerati/alsop/&quot;&gt;Stewart's&lt;/a&gt; conferences for me in the 90s. Sure you go for the music, but &lt;i&gt;mainly&lt;/i&gt; you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;schmooze&lt;/a&gt; in the hallways. I love talking with her on the phone the most. We have thought about doing a podcast, and even tried recording one, but our one-to-one conversations are much more interesting, and funny.

			<title>Why Google should know my blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did a search on my site for NakedJen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google thinks I meant &quot;Naked Men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why Google should know I have a blog and it has it indexed, and if it just looks it would know that question shows how &lt;b&gt;dumb&lt;/b&gt; it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I type my mother's name in, searching on my own blog (again) it tries to correct the spelling of her name. My own mother's name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google started out so smart then they must have lost all the smart people. Or they got stupid? I don't know. But there's so much they could do to improve their product, it would be sensible to, while they're shooting for the fences, do the small things that would give users an idea that there's &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; humanity to the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/13/nakedJenOrNakedMen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;NakedJen or &quot;Naked Men.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: ChatGPT should also know where my blog is, and it should be constantly loading the updates.

			<description>Is this the &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1800879295063003367&quot;&gt;user experience&lt;/a&gt; writers want from WordPress? If I were designing it, I would start from scratch, build an easy writing tool for writers to focus on writing, make the design process accessible if they want to work in that mode, but keep it out of their way because most writing has nothing to do with design.</description>

			<description>A simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/44dbe62f-6bac-4b08-880d-91822be0d6c7&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; where ChatGPT saves programmer time. MySQL has awful error messages. Rather than try to figure out what they mean, I paste the message into ChatGPT and say nothing. It tells me what the error was and even fixes it for me. I copy the result, paste it into MySQL and I'm back on the road. One can imagine where they build that into the MySQL app and I converse with it instead of the app with the awful error messages.</description>

Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It's the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything. They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage on. They don't know how else to do it. It doesn't have much to do with inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It's deeper than that. We're all living a lie, that if we had money we'd be happy. The sad truth is no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don't believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the aftermath, and it wasn't pretty. “All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.” We're at the beginning of the &quot;happen again&quot; moment.

I don't really know who they were, they communicated through their actions, not via email or the phone.

It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups&quot;&gt;beaucoups&lt;/a&gt; money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
