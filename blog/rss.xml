They do eventually tell you the words, but you have to wade through a lot of pointless bullshit to get to it. If I were writing it, the first words of the piece would have to be the words, and then explain it. You've seen this over and over and it gets worse all the time. I still don't understand why they do it, if I'm reading the piece, I'm a paying subscriber, right? Another example of disrespect, quit trying to upsell paying customers. Once a month maybe, but not every 8th time I visit your site. Most businesses have no regard for their customers' time, but the ones that do, really make an impression.</description>

			<description>The Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for Living Videotext begins with one of our slogans. It was a joke, and meant to keep us humble, so we listen to users. It was one of many such slogans. LVT made some important contributions to the networks we use today. Wikipedia should talk about that first, show some respect, for crying out loud. Otherwise, except for that snipe up front, the account is actually pretty accurate.</description>

			<description>It's nice to see the DNC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-democratic-national-convention-is-giving-influencers-media-credentials-for-the-first-time-why-both-campaigns-are-pivoting-to-social-first-strategies-110059052.html&quot;&gt;including influencers&lt;/a&gt; this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html&quot;&gt;at the DNC in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Elon bought the airport</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world hub like Atlanta, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-london-heathrow-lhr&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; or Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a network of airports, like the ones served by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/cheap-flight-destinations&quot;&gt;Ryanair&lt;/a&gt; in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought, but it's not as much of a hub yet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-orlando-mco&quot;&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-frankfurt-fra&quot;&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it's where most of the traffic already goes. It's quite possibly not running that smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction, huge traffic, broken systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/14/weTryHarder.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;When I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel funding for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;LVT&lt;/a&gt;, I asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they're not going away. Companies that large don't disappear. After 40 years of experience in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very rarely disappear. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles#Counterculture_of_the_1960s_and_1970s&quot;&gt;Laurel Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Or who knows? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's a high probability that Musk's company will be the market leader for the forseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reliable app storage over time is not here yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an interesting design challenge either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000 characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what we've settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From a tweet to a long blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server and network technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In every way it'll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to create structures of writing over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that last sentence is the gotcha -- &lt;i&gt;over time. &lt;/i&gt;It's the frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there's no way for me, as an individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month. A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I started an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; writing on GitHub. It's still just a fraction of my writing, I'm not doing anything like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I've managed to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month, which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I guess for the project I'm doing I will again use GitHub to mirror the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for this purpose, or something much better comes along.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for enough time to present the &lt;i&gt;illusion&lt;/i&gt; of persistence. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kvell&quot;&gt;kvelling&lt;/a&gt; the other day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-wOWuDJUU6&quot;&gt;about rss.app&lt;/a&gt; and how they have feeds for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; accounts. They do. But there are two caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.app/pricing&quot;&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $9.99 per month for 15 feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people's budgets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The second concern is more serious. It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. This is not right, and it's not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it. There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter isn't over</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn't watch reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even though I guess the rest of the world thinks he's big in NY.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German in Queens, but not that rare either.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think this is over are fooled, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/18/inciting-rioters-in-britain-was-a-test-run-for-elon-musk-just-see-what-he-plans-for-america&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in today's Guardian for another perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism is very important part of how our country works yet there is no accountability, no checks and balances, no requirement of transparency. There isnâ€™t even a mechanism to disagree with them. most of the time they have the only voice. We donâ€™t even know what theyâ€™re trying to do, what their goals are.</description>

We've had to live with journalism that tries to give lies equal stature to actual news, but the two just don't mix. What happens if your news is half lies, the users don't believe &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; you carry. This was predicted, in 2016 when it was clear that Putin's Russia was heavily influencing American journalism. They had developed their techniques in Ukraine in previous years, and the Ukraine press and government came to the same conclusion we're now arriving at -- stop at the first lie, turn the microphone off. That's the main rule, main change that has to take place now, in advance of the November election. They may not do it, but at least now we all understand that what they're doing is stupid, wrong, even corrupt. No matter what they don't get to keep their rep if they are laundering lies.</description>

What these reporters hope to do (I guess) is convince you that the lies they just broadcast don't reflect poorly on them. If they said &quot;that guy just lied five times&quot; you'd have to wonder why they included it. What's wrong with them. But if they just were &quot;misleading&quot; oh I guess that's okay. Same thing happened in an otherwise pretty honorable &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3yKwJE4&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post. &quot;When not one but multiple rants call 'into question not only his fitness for office but his basic cognitive abilities,' the mediaâ€™s refusal to convey Trumpâ€™s unfitness amounts to misleading the public.&quot; No. It's not just misleading, it's deadly -- to the reputation of the publication that didn't convey what they saw clearly with their own two eyes. The rest of the Rubin piece is worth reading. I expect she softened her criticism because she has to work with the editors at the Post who decided to keep cutting Trump slack. You and I don't have that problem. The news industry in the US must be scrapped and replaced with one that tells the truth, otherwise what's the point.</description>

I want a simple, widely accepted easy place to comment, on the social web, not Discourse or GitHub, that isn't controlled by one vendor (so ActivityPub for now is probably the best approach) and supports plain old Markdown without any weird embellishments. I don't work in the Mastodon world, I'm already committed to the projects I'm doing. But we could really use something nice, designed to plug into blogs. This is a good use-case, and it's pretty close.</description>

			<description>August 15, 2004: My &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/08/15/augustCoffeeNotes.html&quot;&gt;audio blog post&lt;/a&gt; from NYC, from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Podcast0 feed&lt;/a&gt;. Had just listened to an Adam Curry podcast and one from the Gillmor Gang. Played a bit of music, described how a podcatcher would work, pretty close to the way they work today. Shortly after the feature would be in Radio UserLand. It was the only episode I did in August 2004. The next one is on September 1 and there are a total of nine shows in September, including the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://secrets.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt; which is a podcast Adam and I did together. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/08.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for this blog in August 2004.</description>

			<description>The best journalism is coming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq&quot;&gt;from the candidate&lt;/a&gt;. I think you could make a pretty good hour-length show on MSNBC with 12 of their posts, five minutes each, one after the other, with a small panel of pundits quickly snarking about what they just saw. Go have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq&quot;&gt;the feed&lt;/a&gt; and see if you agree. The best thing about it is that the writing is totally blogger-style.</description>

			<title>Musk is just getting started</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a&quot;&gt;11 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see happy talk all over the place that Twitter is done, Musk is killing it, blah blah blah. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. In the next few months Twitter is going to morph into the political system that Barack Obama could have and should have built.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turns out creating a president of the United States is worth a lot of money. Trump is inept at squeezing the money out of it, he's a loudmouth who proved one thing, Twitter is all you needed in 2016 to get elected president. That's going to change, as competition shows up (Zuckerberg, for example, with Threads). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They know, even if you don't -- that it can be very profitable to own the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Trump loses, Musk won't get it on this round, but eventually he will own a big piece of the president, and then he will move his deals with SpaceX and Tesla up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, it's only 11 minutes. You probably haven't considered this angle, but I promise you he's moving, and he's mostly unopposed right now. He's not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nudnik&quot;&gt;nudnick&lt;/a&gt; so many people seem to think he is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Harris makes me proud</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this campaign. Latest innovation, they're going to do at least one public rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration, and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don't want to witness is what the journalists try to provoke. I've been to two DNCs and later heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented crises that simply didn't exist. Who's going to have time to call them out because no one at the convention is watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard on a podcast yesterday that it's weird that Harris is polling as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important&quot;&gt;generic&lt;/a&gt; Democrat, which they felt was odd because she's not a white man, which made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party. Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not interracial and female.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the United States. We're strong, and we win, and when we don't we get back up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we've yet to create the interracial and female version that symbol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it doesn't have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our political system its flirtation with fascism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/14/ladyLibertyFullSizeIowa.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Statue of Liberty in the heartland. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had another morning of driving around so I listened to a bunch of podcasts about how the campaign is going, all good news for Democrats which of course makes me happy. The last podcast I listened to was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nate-silver.html&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein's interview with Nate Silver&lt;/a&gt;. I only listened to the first 20 minutes because I ran out of time. I may pick it up later on my afternoon walk (it's a gorgeous day in the mountains). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/13/trafficUptight.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;They talked about their bond as old school bloggers. I didn't know either of them when they were starting out, which is kind of sad -- most of the bloggers I heard from in that period were mad at me the way they are mad at Elon Musk now. Both Silver and Klein campaigned for Biden to step aside, which I felt it was inappropriate -- for Silver who was/is a trusted polling analyst, and Klein who is a columnist for the NYT. I had already listened to Klein's interview with Nancy Pelosi. But I really don't like that both of them crossed a line I felt they had no business crossing, becoming an advocate rather than a journalist. I can't thikn about either of them without thinking about that. But I listened anyway, because I'm interested in both, and esp the combination. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The discussion was interesting and even agreeable until Klein asked Silver about his relationship with Peter Thiel. I had read that Silver was connected to Thiel in some way. Before they moved on neither commented on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape&quot;&gt;Thiel's funding&lt;/a&gt; of the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that destroyed Gawker. I don't know how they can both, for their careers, which depend on free speech, still have a kind word for Thiel. I never liked Gawker, they made fun of me, and others, in horrific ways, that weren't even based on facts, the kind of bullshit pre-teens make up about people when they can't think of anything else to say. Even though they hurt me, embarrassed me, aroused my hate, even if I had the kind of money Thiel has, I never in a million years would use that money to destroy them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thiel's wealth is a weapon aimed at all our freedom. This is something imho that has to at least be &lt;i&gt;mentioned&lt;/i&gt; when a journalist talks about Thiel, and neither of them did. I guess they feel safe from Thiel's attacks, perhaps because they have adjusted their writing so as to never risk offending him, which totally undermines their integrity, if so. A good way to prove that's not true would be to never mention him without saying his behavior the Hulk Hogan vs Gawker was reprehensible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still listened, even though they provoked my ire in a very fundamental way. I'd be interested in hearing from them, as a fellow old school blogger, if they justify Thiel's funding of the Hogan lawsuit and if so, how. But I expect that both of them consider themselves in an elite class and wouldn't deign to explain themselves, or the truth is something they don't want disclosed. Either way, to be blogger-blunt, they both suck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: I listened to more of the interview. I think these guys need to get out more. The reason Harris is having such a strong response is that we the voters are desperate to not have another term for Trump. We understand the stakes in the election. You always try to reduce it to numbers, when the facts are available at a more human level. The reason we love Kamala is born of desperation. Stop talking to each other, you already know why we care, because underneath it all &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; care because you're human and you come from America too. And btw about VCs, I know a lot about them, I'm assuming at some point Klein will leave the NYT to make millions with Thiel, and I imagine Silver is already doing that, but you both have the disease. You assume great money makes people interesting. It can make them dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A new rule for journalists. End the interview on the first egregious lie. Turn the lights out, switch off the recorder, get up and leave. And your report should state clearly that this is why the interview was terminated. It never should have been tolerated in the first place.</description>

			<description>I listened to a bunch of podcasts this morning about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/184754/donald-trump-freaked-out-harris-walz-attacks&quot;&gt;freaked out Trump&lt;/a&gt; is. If a president freaks out over something like this, how would he handle a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis&quot;&gt;Cuban Missile Crisis&lt;/a&gt;? Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg&quot;&gt;phone call&lt;/a&gt; at 3AM? We saw what he did with COVID, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/politics/kamala-harris-speech/index.html&quot;&gt;froze&lt;/a&gt;, like he's freezing now.</description>
