Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every &quot;page&quot; on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web. So for example, an iPhone app isn't on the web just because it has an information page that is.</description>

			<description>I'm working my way through Mr Robot, for the third time I think. If you want to know what I do, it's like what Elliot does, for about four hours pretty much every day. I used to work longer hours but I've found this amount of work is optimal. I make more mistakes after about 1PM. Anyway Mr Robot is a very good thing to watch for the times we live in. The technology is already a little outdated, but they thought of that, there are some scenes where they use old PCs from the 80s, with total respect. I like that. And the utilities he uses are pretty much the same ones I use these days. And the context of a world in technological meltdown, I think that's a very realistic scenario. I don't see how our networks can't avoid breaking down. And our health care system, which these days is pretty much the same thing.</description>

			<description>I think perhaps I should have one day every week where I never link to anything. Just to provide a demo of what the web would be like without linking. Which is most of the sites that say they are part of the web. I think that's a lie we should stop tolerating. Or maybe I should just stop offsite linking for one day a week. That would be interesting wouldn't it. Or I could charge extra for the version with the links. (It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; done that at times.)</description>

			<description>I asked, yesterday, on various social media sites, for people's opinion on what the term &quot;on the web&quot; means. I'm going to compile the answers on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/web/what.opml&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt;, and then ask some follow-up questions. If you have an opinion, post a comment on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lx6ww3lqx22q&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/115087015889672419&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.com/@davew/post/DNwtUao3FZL&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1959803988733288674&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I've been exchanging emails and voicemails with &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/dpknauss/&quot;&gt;Dan Knauss&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime WordPress developer and one of the hosts of WordCamp Canada which I am speaking at in October. Learning a lot about the community and culture. I wonder, have I ever been part of a community that's over 20 years old? I can't think of one off the top of my head. I have gotten this far without knowing much about the WordPress community, other than what I've heard via Matt and what I've been able to infer from that. I've known Matt since he was a teenage boy wonder in the tech industry working at CNET and then as an entrepreneur. I think my point of view is a new one, I don't bring much baggage with me. I am generally sympathetic with Matt, having been the leader of the blogging world when it started, and found it a pretty thankless place, a position I was happy to relinquish in 2003 when I went to academia.</description>

			<description>There's a fresh release of the docs for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/&quot;&gt;WordPress API&lt;/a&gt; we use in WordLand. I actually liked that the docs were old and kind of dusty. It says that the engineering culture is to not mess around with things that developers have already built on. A lot of platforms break developers without much thought. I learned a long time ago that when you do that, you lose the interest of developers, understandably.</description>

			<description>I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience. I wrote about this a few years back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/phoenix/&quot;&gt;Developing Better Developers&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Trump's secret was comedy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump is a comedian. He makes people laugh the way Joan Rivers or Don Rickles did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's verbal slapstick, which is for some reason I don't understand immensely funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Newsom is making us laugh by imitating Trump imitating Joan and Don. It's working. He must keep doing it, and he should evolve the schtick, he should make Trump match &lt;i&gt;him. &lt;/i&gt;And where Trump is promoting depraved policies with his comedy, we can count on Newsom to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law and all the progress we've made. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He can invite famous comedians on his podcast to play opposite him, sometimes the straight man, playing their SNL roles. So much potential. He's got the attention, don't throw it away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Politics was boring, it's not boring anymore. But there's no reason excitement and entertainment can't be good for us too! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump's secret is comedy and Newsom is stealing his thunder&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone.</description>

			<title>Discourse as it exists today</title>

I wasn't in any way intending on provoking a conversation like that here. So I'm going to delete the comments that have gone off in that direction, and please don't post any more. I don't mind you having that conversation, but do it somewhere else where I don't have to read it. Thanks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere that's the only structure for discourse we've created. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can do better. I have to create my own system to prove it, so much work, but worth it, I expect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We now look for feeds from wordpress sites, and copy the site ID and the ID for each post as channel-level &lt;i&gt;wpSiteId&lt;/i&gt; and item-level &lt;i&gt;wpPostId. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdaveverse.org%2Ffeed%2F&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. This will make &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Edit%20This%20Page%22&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; functionality possible in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; product I'm building now. This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql&quot;&gt;FeedLand level&lt;/a&gt; (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)</description>

The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the &lt;i&gt;parent&lt;/i&gt; of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw." created="Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:13:33 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/08/22.html#a151333"/>

			<description>Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make&quot;&gt;Make your own world&lt;/a&gt;. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is becoming more and more of an enemy. It's still my go-to place for most planning and research, which is a very large part of how I use the web. But when it tries to be a human it's a really shitty one, no manners, and very little respect and basically a fucking idiot in many ways, imho ymmv.</description>

			<title>What podcasting is</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A standard format for recording. MP3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dermotcasey.bsky.social/post/3lwtrlfyo6s23&quot;&gt;Dermot Casey&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'd add Dave to this list.

			<description>The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesn’t take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/&quot;&gt;$170 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.</description>

It's hard to watch at times, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes&quot;&gt;main character&lt;/a&gt; of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell&quot;&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.</description>

			<description>I want to switch cell providers, so I used ChatGPT to figure out that Consumer Cellular is the best choice for me. I finally get around to filling in the form, and it complains about my zip code. &quot;No service.&quot; Yes I know, there's no cell coverage where I live. I still need a freaking cell phone. Called them, the sales person says maybe it's a problem with your computer. Geez Louise. It's a problem with &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; computer. How many years have they had to fix this stupid bug. I could see if I was buying a landline. But this is a &lt;i&gt;mobile&lt;/i&gt; device. That means it moves. To places with cell coverage.</description>

			<description>What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. You could view a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.</description>

I'm working a few hours a day on the integration of writing and timelines built around feeds. Instead of using Bluesky or Mastodon, with their limits, we use WordPress for storage. It has none of their limits, has a high performance open source server back-end, debugged complete API, it's not without problems, but far ahead of where the competition is in terms are reliablity and ease of implementation. &lt;i&gt;To be part of this network, all you need is an RSS feed. &lt;/i&gt;Seems pretty openly billionaire-proof wouldn't you say.</description>

A network that will only require an RSS feed for entry. It's what we should've built in 2006 and didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I want a new ChatGPT mode where I drive the work, not the bot. I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions. I call this &quot;behave like a computer, not a human.&quot; Because it's a fanstastic computer, but not a good partner.</description>

Then I realized that sometimes in software I'm climbing a cliff that's too tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything, because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a layer I can build on. Anyway I'm in the middle of one of those corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks like it might have. I'm being sure not to create another mess that needs to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I'd rather be doing anything but this. :-)</description>

I still want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests of one person (me). My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; is this: &quot;Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information..&quot; The response was basically: &quot;I'm sorry Dave.&quot; Groan. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482&quot;&gt;the details&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Paul%20Boutin%22&quot;&gt;Paul Boutin&lt;/a&gt; who I know from early Wired days offers some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179622599&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; that it can be gotten to work, with a bit more guesswork, trial and error and head scratching. I probably will keep coming back to this until I break through. Or maybe hook up with another developer who can back into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;websocket hose&lt;/a&gt; coming out of FeedLand. It's a natural thing to hook up to AI systems.</description>

			<title>Flower Power in 2025</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You're going to think this is crazy, but maybe we should do what the hippie kids did in the 60s and 70s, giving flowers to the new cops in DC. Start off saying we don't blame you, we'll give you the benefit of the doubt, let's all be Americans and remember what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/12/flowerPower.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_Power_(photograph)&quot;&gt;Flower power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Or if users get an idea for linking two products, they can do it with scripting. It was a dream we had for the Mac, but it fell apart because Apple wanted to control everything. I find it's better when developers are free to work with each other, without interference from a big company like Apple. That's why &quot;platform without a platform vendor&quot; was the most important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn't just work with other developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In one swoop we lost all the features listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; page. I am betting everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being before that and at the same time create a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, far beyond what Twitter and twitter-like systems can do.</description>

It's bingeable in an afternoon, tells an interesting story of Katrina and New Orleans. The interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/katrina-10-years-later-brownie-youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-job/4548480&quot;&gt;Brownie&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;i&gt;cringe&lt;/i&gt;-worthy not binge-worthy, I skipped over it.</description>
