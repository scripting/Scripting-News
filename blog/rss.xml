Do you remember when you first realized that people weren't talking to you in a response to your post, they were talking over your shoulder to the people who read your post. I guess it depends on who you are, but I don't see any value in providing a surface for spam. These days I block people without much thought if I think that's what they're doing. So, why should you design a protocol, and pay the cost of supporting, something that is a vector for spam and abuse? That's the argument in favor of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; to glue things together. You can comment on my post, in your space, but my followers don't have to see it. That's up to me. I think it would change the nature of discourse, for the better.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT has memory across chats. This just &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptmessage.png&quot;&gt;popped up&lt;/a&gt; on the screen. I'd like to tell it that until further notice I use Node.js and do not use Express, and do use jQuery for my browser-based JavaScript, and I use the debugger all the time, so you can assume that. If this works, I now have a programming partner with memory. And maybe I can somehow get it to read all my blog posts going back 30 years? I have good archives of most of it. Also, of course I &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptcomments.png&quot;&gt;fed this post&lt;/a&gt; to ChatGPT of course. So ChatGPT is not resting on its laurels. That's good. I'd really like a &lt;i&gt;Personal ChatGPT, &lt;/i&gt;and this is on the way to that goal.</description>

			<description>When I started working with Automattic last year, one of the big milestones we were aiming for was getting FeedLand and WordPress working together. Now we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/24/132025.html?title=feedlandAndWordpress&quot;&gt;the first step&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you take a moment to give it a try and let us know how it works. Scripting News readers have helped bootstrap all kinds of cool stuff, we can do it again.</description>

			<title>FeedLand and WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll&quot;&gt;new plugin&lt;/a&gt; that adds a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; to a WordPress site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be helpful if people who are regular readers of Scripting News who use WordPress, set up a test site, give it a try and let us know how it goes. You can help us get to the next level with this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So there are two sides, the FeedLand side and the WordPress side.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The FeedLand side&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?signonscreen=true&quot;&gt;Sign on&lt;/a&gt; to FeedLand, create an account if you don't have one, and subscribe to a bunch of feeds. These will be the feeds in your blogroll.  There are some tips on how to find feeds, in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/24/132025.html#a134443&quot;&gt;next section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The WordPress side&lt;/b&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll&quot;&gt;new plugin&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the people at the Team51 group at Automattic. They have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll/blob/trunk/README.md&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; for how to install the plugin in a WordPress site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can get ideas for feeds for your blogroll from reading other people's feed lists. When you see a checkbox that isn't checked, you can subscribe to the feed simply by checking the box. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt; for ideas. Here's a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?userslist&quot;&gt;recent users&lt;/a&gt;, click on their names to see their feed lists. You don't have to finish this now, you can come back and tune this up anytime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Developers: Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandBlogrollToolkit&quot;&gt;feedlandBlogrollToolkit&lt;/a&gt; to add blogrolls to other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, or need help getting it working, post a note in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll/discussions/15&quot;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I'd like to combine AI and search to make a really great search engine for bloggers. We would contribute what we know (we already do) and in return, along with everyone else, get to benefit from the collection. And when we browse, &lt;i&gt;it knows which blog we write.&lt;/i&gt; So it has a very good idea of what we mean when we ask a question and what we already know. This is totally missing in ChatGPT and is something Google and other search engines have never been willing to do (or even understood, I guess). But this is a huge idea. I'd like to give it &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=blogroll&quot;&gt;my blogroll&lt;/a&gt; too, so it knows which sources I consider credible.

			<description>I was chatting with a friend who went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science&quot;&gt;Bronx Science&lt;/a&gt;, as I did, and we were talking about Isaac Asimov, and I said I thought he went to Science too. So I fired up ChatGPT and asked if Asimov went to Science, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/81199c5a-ca0a-4a2c-b610-e0799722a03f&quot;&gt;it said yes&lt;/a&gt;. Then I asked where he went to high school and it said Bronx Science. But by then I was pretty sure he didn't, so I went to Google and meta.ai, and neither knew where he went to high school. So I asked on Twitter, Mastodon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/112321321415008740&quot;&gt;Blue Sky&lt;/a&gt; and Threads. Not sure why I even care! Oh well. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I don't have time to write about it now but the end of last night's Knicks game was one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VUvcuHwgtw&quot;&gt;most dramatic bits&lt;/a&gt; of NY sports ever. I would like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/&quot;&gt;thank Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; for saying the Knicks weren't cool.

			<title>Quiet mode for the blogroll</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After living with the blogroll on the home page of Scripting News for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html&quot;&gt;about a month&lt;/a&gt;, and having heard from early testers, I felt that it was demanding too much attention when I was reading stuff on the blog. So I made some time last week to experiment with a subtler sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet Mode,&lt;/i&gt; the blogroll doesn't call attention to itself until you click on it. Then its background changes from neutral to white. That's the equivalent of shining a spotlight on it. Also the borders become blue to indicate that the browser's focus is on the blogroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do more to tone it down. So, in Quiet Mode the title moves up and to the left, and is in a much smaller font, boldface, nicely visible and stands off from the list, but doesn't call your attention to it. It's there when you want to know more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You may want to call it something other than a blogroll, btw. If you're using blogs to coordinate projects with others, something I think a lot more people would do if it worked better, instead of &quot;blogroll&quot; you'd might call it your &quot;workgroup.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have switched &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; over to the new quiet mode, it's already the default, but I put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/20/checkbox.png&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/a&gt; just below the blogroll that lets you toggle between the two modes to see the difference and possibly spot problems. The checkbox will go away before long. I just want it there to quickly do an A-B comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zfNS97NUHB4&quot;&gt;quick video demo&lt;/a&gt; of Quiet Mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/304&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment or ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The two concepts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality&quot;&gt;orthogonal&lt;/a&gt;. I do not support the Israeli government any more than I supported the government of my country, the United States, when the MAGAs were in charge. We lost over 1 million Americans who did not have to die imho, because our government was not only immoral and hugely corrupt, but also made no attempt to govern. I am a child of Holocaust survivors and an American born in the USA, and am proud of and grateful to my country. Any American is free to protest the actions of our government or any other government, or really anything. If you don't believe in that then you aren't actually trying to make America great, you're saying something altogether different and incompatible. I am American. I am also deeply offended at other Americans who propose to speak for me. That actually is antisemitic, btw.</description>

			<description>Quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.ai/&quot;&gt;meta.ai&lt;/a&gt;. This is a demo of just one feature, its ability to recalc drawings as you edit the prompt that defines the picture. As you can tell from the demo I love it because it's new, creative, super fun to use and to watch the result. And lovely to see this much progress so quickly. You really should watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; so you can see how what I type relates to the image in real-time. It's like subtitles inverted, with a very knowledgeable, creative and high bandwidth computer network behind it. Living in the future.</description>

			<title>WordPress For One</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/21/beetle.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;More and more I'm getting used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; as the platform I develop for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you, as a developer, could add your own data to a WordPress post. Then you could build editors that work at a higher level. For example, you'd keep the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html?title=markdownIsJustEnoughHtml&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; source for the page. When it was saved the system would re-render the Markdown, turning it into HTML, but you'd still have the Markdown around for editing. And of course there are other kinds of editors that make sense, knowing that the output is going to the web, but you don't have to &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; in the technical language of the web. You might want something more suited to wordsmiths -- ie &lt;i&gt;writers, &lt;/i&gt;if you are a writer. I have that working here, and have been building on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've gone back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/radio/screenshots.opml?permalink=20240219144035&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; and tried to extrapolate, where would we have gone with that product, 22 years later. And now I'm beginning to see in the pieces that are forming the new product I've been working on, something whole, something that works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of it as &quot;WordPress For One&quot; -- you might be writing as part of a larger site, but this is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; writing space, a place you can mold to fit your style, where it gets more comfortable over the years, more you. That's what I've felt has been wrong with the direction the web has been going in, we're getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;boxed&lt;/a&gt; into smaller and smaller spaces, but for some of my writing I want a nice stage with good lighting and full freedom to tell a story that I have to tell, not necessarily all at once, but possibly in a series, over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also want to be influenced by your story. I want &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;Working Together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course I still very much develop for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, and in the back of my mind I want to loop back around to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; (it's my main writing environment), and then I have another product I call Belter I want to finish. And I wouldn't mind trying to make a CSS thing that makes more sense than the tragedy CSS is, and also would love to see a port of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; to Linux, though I don't see doing that myself, but I would like to guide it (so it runs all the old stuff first). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The drawing functionality recalcs while you're entering the prompt, so if you type, &quot;vary gender, age and race,&quot; and as you type each word, the image changes.</description>

How long does it take to switch to writing mode, get the idea down, and return to what you were doing. The less time it takes the more &lt;i&gt;fluidity. &lt;/i&gt;Twitter totally won there. And we, the bloggers, made a tradeoff. We accepted fewer features and writing in a silo because it was practical. It worked, where less fluid software didn't. So they got all the casual writing, and over time sucked the life out of blogging. I think it's time to put the fluidity back, without compromising on features and lock-in.</description>

I had forgotten this. That's how long it's been that he's wanted to hook WP up to the social web. It doesn't look like I posted that to Scripting News. I wonder what other nuggets of forgotten history I'll find there.</description>

			<title>Working together</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Each form of online discussion has a &lt;i&gt;grain&lt;/i&gt; to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt; and I used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/followsthegrain.png&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about how something &quot;follows the grain of the web.&quot; Twitter has its own grain, formed by its character limit, what information is shared (ie number of followers in both directions). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I made a list of some of the social networks I've been on starting in the mid-70s. The list is very long. And each of them had their own limits, rules and features, and each led to a certain kinds of relationships between the participants. Mail lists that gain traction always flame out. It's hard to get people to read your blog. If you make it easier it changes into something else. Instagram, Youtube, TikTok form hierarchies of influencers. I think of those as the networks &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; covers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there isn't a structure that I'm aware of that leads to people working together. It's a puzzle I keep trying to figure out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; to survive climate change and fascism. It would be good to crack this nut. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about ChatGPT is that it's always up for working with you. The critics of AI don't begin to understand this. As an example, I'm going to ask ChatGPT to draw a picture of people working together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/peopleWorkingTogether.png&quot;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't have to wait. It didn't look at my follower count, or my bank statement to decide if it was willing to work with me. I pay the $20 a month, and I've got a persistent always-on collaborator. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking this way this morning is a bit of collaboration I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun&quot;&gt;with palafo&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/patrick-laforge&quot;&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;) on Threads. It's remarkable. We actually did some work together. No sarcasm. It may be hard to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@palafo/post/C5zHWbPOJun&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; but if you're curious about collaborative systems, here's a real example. Serendipitous, unplanned, but we figured something out by combining our experiences. Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/&quot;&gt;Ben Werdmuller&lt;/a&gt;, a person who I've gotten to know recently, is intelligent and asks good questions. He asked one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@ben.werdmuller/post/C50vyIruTCB&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;, how do they get the live audience on SNL to laugh when they want them to laugh. I had an idea and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C50wy5NsYD0&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; it. (This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/1v5hy6/how_does_the_snl_audience_know_when_to_laugh/&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/463e08c0-0380-4e65-9e6c-2742ce91f0db&quot;&gt;checked&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you take away one thing from this post it's that we can collaborate with the machines, and maybe that will unlock collaboration between humans. In fact, in a way they are facilitating the collaboration. If you want to be part of the collective human intelligence, you may be thinking about the machines the wrong way. Maybe they're the most human thing we have, because AI is made up of humans, somewhat like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UPDUpjkHg0&quot;&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/16/cleaningAMess.png&quot;&gt;humans working together&lt;/a&gt; to clean up a mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Yesterday I gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://john.onolan.org/&quot;&gt;John O'Nolan&lt;/a&gt; what I think is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C5y7iVoJP4r&quot;&gt;good idea&lt;/a&gt; for getting his Ghost blogs federating with Threads, Mastodon et al. I didn't expect thanks or even a response, but I wonder if he even heard it. Most of the time, trying to help other people results in not even an acknowledgment that they saw it. If I were him I'd look for a painless, quick way to get maximum interop. Something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.social/&quot;&gt;ghost.social&lt;/a&gt;. I'd give the same advice to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; at Automattic (in fact I think I did). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I think acknowledgment is a key part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html?title=workingTogether&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; on the web. Nothing more than &quot;I wanted you to know I saw it&quot; is often all that's needed to grease the skids of discourse. I've had a friendly disagreement with Manton at micro.blog about this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A blogroll on a Drummer blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;How to add a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;FeedLand blogroll&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;Drummer blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can specify that all the feeds you're subscribed to are in your blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in the blogroll. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new post, it goes to the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items.

In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software. After waiting a whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short periods, but it's most of the time it's been people trying to deconstruct and reinvent other people's work, not build on it. I'm still open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more time.</description>

I don't like that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and everything they (don't) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks (and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.</description>

			<title>It's bigger than a tiny little textbox</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Question: What's between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/14/tinylittletextboxexample.png&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt; and a full-blown content management system?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Answer: A full-featured text editor with a social media feel to it without the limits of twitter-like systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is for, to identity the essential features. This editor supports them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;100% built on WordPress. Why reinvent all the good stuff that's been debugged and scaled and has all that support in the world. As I like to say, one way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/13/biggerThanATinyLittleTextbox.m4a&quot;&gt;seven-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; that explains.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: And don't forget about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social&quot;&gt;the blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.

There was very little to laugh about in this new version, but omg it is such a beautifully presented story. Even if you hated the plot you'd have to watch it just to see the art. And if you're Italian or love Italy, you have to watch it. Anyway now that I know all the twists and how it ends, I'm going to have to watch it again, but I might wait to recover from the experience. It is, at times, hard to watch. But oh so goooood.</description>
