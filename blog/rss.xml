			<description>&quot;When your house is on fire there aren’t two sides.&quot; A few people misunderstood. In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/24.html#a204037&quot;&gt;analogy&lt;/a&gt; there are no arsonists. There is the house and there is fire. If you were reporting on this situation, you don't need to find out what motivates the fire, the only important thing is that if not checked it will destroy the house.</description>

			<title>Bezos blinked</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My op-ed for the Washington Post, if there was such a thing..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't imagine that Bezos cared what subscribers to the Washington Post thought about his decision to cancel their endorsement of VP Harris in the election one week from today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations&quot;&gt;200K people unsubscribed&lt;/a&gt;, and I guess that message got through to him, so he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/&quot;&gt;wrote an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that ran in the Post yesterday, explaining that this was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+principled&quot;&gt;principled&lt;/a&gt; thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If it was really a matter of principle, they wouldn't have chosen this election, and one where his own personal interest was so involved. It doesn't &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; principled, and when you're trying to do something principled, it pretty much has to look that way or you have to conclude that it's bullshit, which it obviously is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/17/dewey.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It's surprising that he cares. The Post was worth $250M when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html&quot;&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; it in 2013, maybe it's worth more than that now, but it's a very small part of his current $205B net worth. If owning the Post would interfere with his other businesses in a negative way, and if the problem could be solved by dropping it, I don't doubt that he would do that. Then why this op-ed? It could be that someone in his family objected, sometimes people react to that in ways that could cost money. It's possible. It's also possible that he's not sure that Trump will win, and being a calculating person, he realizes now that he's created a similar problem for himself if the Democrats win. The Trumps won't care if he lies about the reason, so lying about the reason was the obvious path for him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think what we're really seeing is that owning a high profile news org like the Post isn't something for Mr Bezos. He would probably be better off selling the Post, so he doesn't have to make these kinds of principled bullshit choices, when clearly the only principled thing to do is not abandon American democracy in its hour of greatest need.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I agree with everything he said. Really glad that people with clear mind and purpose are using our medium to do the good we hoped for. Best part was where he quoted Obama agreeing that things don't change when you elect a new president. Change can't come that fast unless we bring a substantial majority of other Americans with us. The vote isn't a way to make change, it isn't a way to express yourself, it's &lt;i&gt;your role in governing&lt;/i&gt; our country. It's not the First Amendment or the Second Amendment, it's the whole Constitution. It's the most power every one of us gets. Even the president doesn't have the power of our votes. You don't get a specific result from your vote, that would be the fascism that we're trying to avoid. It's the consenus that build that makes the difference. And Obama is too modest because he made at least a couple of big changes. First, everyone has a right to health insurance now because we elected Obama. That's no small deal, coming from someone who has depended on health insurance to survive, a couple of times. And second, we stirred the racial pot in this country in a positive way. Not to say we got peace and love as a result. Because there are a lot of white folks who don't want that pot stirred. But that was change nonetheless. The only way we get there, and I've said this many times, is by working together. Blame is powerless. Acceptance is powerful.</description>

The game in Boston on Tuesday was disheartening. It's a new team with the core of last year's team. And when the fans started roaring when there was nothing happening on the court, last night at the (NY) Garden, it was because the Yankees had scored in the World Series game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Madison+Square+Garden,+New+York,+NY+10001/Dodger+Stadium,+1000+Vin+Scully+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012/@35.9504718,-117.3686049,9288091m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m16!4m15!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x33df10e49762f8e4!2m2!1d-73.9934387!2d40.7505045!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c2c6f954005675:0x9e94554f839c09df!2m2!1d-118.2399583!2d34.073851!2m1!2b1!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;2794&lt;/a&gt; miles away in Los Angeles. This is the &lt;i&gt;inconvenience&lt;/i&gt; of being a Knicks fan who hates the freaking Yankees. We have to share an NBA team. The Knicks are much more like the Mets than that other team. That's why it's so incredible to see the 2024 Knicks be able to manage both ends of the court, and completely shut down a team that last year beat them in playoffs, the Pacers, just like last year, but better. A validation of everything. Now the team has to stay healthy. But, even if they don't fly the Nazi flag at Trump's rally tomorrow, you know that they want to, and some of them probably brought them. It's a funny time for the Garden. The owner of the Garden btw is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;James Dolan&lt;/a&gt;. We try to overlook that he owns the Knicks and he seems to be cooperating by staying out of the our faces. But he is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jipel.law.nyu.edu/the-power-of-exclusion-madison-square-garden-uses-facial-recognition-technology-to-ban-the-owners-enemies/&quot;&gt;vile man&lt;/a&gt; to the people of New York.</description>

And when the fans started roaring when there was nothing happening on the court, last night at the (NY) Garden, it was because the Yankees had scored in the World Series game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Madison+Square+Garden,+New+York,+NY+10001/Dodger+Stadium,+1000+Vin+Scully+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012/@35.9504718,-117.3686049,9288091m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m16!4m15!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x33df10e49762f8e4!2m2!1d-73.9934387!2d40.7505045!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c2c6f954005675:0x9e94554f839c09df!2m2!1d-118.2399583!2d34.073851!2m1!2b1!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&quot;&gt;2794&lt;/a&gt; miles away in Los Angeles. This is the &lt;i&gt;inconvenience&lt;/i&gt; of being a Knicks fan who hates the freaking Yankees. We have to share an NBA team. The Knicks are much more like the Mets than that other team. That's why it's so incredible to see the 2024 Knicks be able to manage both ends of the court, and completely shut down a team that last year beat them in playoffs, the Pacers, just like last year, but better. A validation of everything. Now the team has to stay healthy. But, even if they don't fly the Nazi flag at Trump's rally tomorrow, you know that they want to, and some of them probably brought them. It's a funny time for the Garden. The owner of the Garden btw is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;James Dolan&lt;/a&gt;. We try to overlook that he owns the Knicks and he seems to be cooperating by staying out of the our faces. But he is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jipel.law.nyu.edu/the-power-of-exclusion-madison-square-garden-uses-facial-recognition-technology-to-ban-the-owners-enemies/&quot;&gt;vile man&lt;/a&gt; to the people of New York." created="Sat, 26 Oct 2024 14:52:43 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/12/10/thisIsNextYear.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/10/26.html#a145243"/>

			<description>BTW if you're thinking why don't we just go for the Nets. As I've said here many times, there aren't actually any Nets fans to speak of in NY. That was the huge self-parody &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barstoolsports.com/blog/1365086/kevin-durants-reasoning-for-choosing-the-nets-is-the-biggest-crock-of-shit-youve-ever-heard&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; did when he claimed there was some kind of rivalry between the Nets and the Knicks. Really unfortunate unforced error he could have just asked a few people where are all the Nets fans.</description>

			<description>So when the Dodger hit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/video/freddie-freeman-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-right-field-chris-taylor-scores-to&quot;&gt;walk-off grand slam&lt;/a&gt; last night, half of me was ecstatic because the Yankees were beaten, but oops, but I hate it even more that the freaking Dodgers won. This World Series is unique in that I desperately want both teams to lose. What do you do with that??</description>

			<title>Let's bust some new norms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why hasn’t the NY Times run a story that takes Trump at face value and explains to voters what it would be like to live in that United States? It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DBjMQCDsZdy&quot;&gt;An example&lt;/a&gt;. Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade should be imprisoned:  “These people should be put in jail for the way they talk about our judges and justices.” &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A news story on this subject should include calls to all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx&quot;&gt;justices&lt;/a&gt; on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've relied too much on the Democrats to stick their necks out, when in fact all our necks are on the line here. So if you have something to say about this, now is the time to do it. In a couple of weeks it might be too late. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think it's probably too late, anyway. Journalism should have reported, constantly, that the house is on fire. And nothing else. Biden's age didn't enter into it you fools. The much bigger story was and is that Hitler wants to be president, and this time he has a plan. It was true then and it's true now. The next question is what will Biden do if Trump wins. It was tough watching Obama greet Trump at the White House in 2016. I can't see Biden doing that. I wonder what ideas they're workshopping in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_Room&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; Situation Room.</description>

			<title>The million-plus Americans Trump killed</title>

Yes, a lot of them died during Biden's tenure too. But I don't think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled, first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter, then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never said geez I was wrong about this, it's a killer, and btw thanks for saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don't tell me I'm biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he's the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven't voted yet, save us from concentration camps and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration&quot;&gt;mass deportation&lt;/a&gt;. One million Americans dead is far too many, let's not try to top that. Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got a notice that Threads had deleted one of my posts because they said it violated their rules. They thought I was claiming to have written something I had not written. I didn't keep the notice (it popped up when I signed on). I shrugged it off when I got it, but then realized that we are very far away from the web. It has been turned into Disneyland where the cops are algorithms and they err on the side of stopping innocent things. I was just passing on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rohan.ga/blog/early-internet/&quot;&gt;link to someone else's blog&lt;/a&gt;, something I thought an informed person would want to know about (that's the idea behind every link I share). We really do need to dig our way out of this hole, again. This is of course no better than Twitter or Facebook. Not a place to get work done.</description>

			<title>I'm sticking with WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm continuing to develop on WordPress. I see the opportunity regardless of what else is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- and that basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don't think that's very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father's memorial site, for example. Things would have to get incomprehensibly bad for me to consider moving it and where exactly would I move it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for the writers. I think I'm pretty much alone working in this area. And maybe people need some good news? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My new product is a medium size writing tool. Less than a full word processor and more than a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text box&lt;/a&gt;. I think there are a lot of WordPress users who will like it. And I think there's a chance they might notice it. So I'm going all the way with this one. I may lose the bet, but wtf, let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I didn't think the Mets would make it through any of the hurdles, making the playoffs, and beating the Brewers and Phillies. That was amazing. And the energy of this team, their humor and inventiveness, professionalism and perseverance. The Mets of 2024 were a great team, and they give us something to look forward to in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say Mets pitchers walked too many Dodgers, but the walks were a result of discipline on the part of the Dodgers hitters. Most pitchers throw a lot of crap, and the hitters swing at it. The Dodgers are more discerning. If the Mets pitchers had thrown strikes they would have hit home runs. It's another way of saying that the Dodgers, no matter how much we despise them, this year at least, were the better team.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there is a silver lining. I wasn't sure I wanted the Mets to beat the Dodgers once we knew the team from the &quot;other&quot; league was going to be the Jankees. Last time the Mets played them in the World Series, they beat us in Shea Stadium and as a result we had to tear it down and start over. I don't think any of us wanted that, or even to risk having to tear down Citi Field. I don't like to be reminded that the Jankees even exist, much less be forced to watch them play. And honestly between the Dodgers and the other NY team, I want them &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; to lose. Is there any way to arrange that? I don't even want to know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway thanks to the Mets for being such a wonderful team, a constant inspiration. So onward. Next year. And now..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks begin their season &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/sport/basketball/article/3283231/nba-season-opens-boston-celtics-eyeing-dynasty-and-knicks-chasing-first-title-1973&quot;&gt;tomorrow night&lt;/a&gt; in Boston against the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

So I want &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. Mobile people either don't care or don't want it. So it stands to reason we need a different user interface. We can use the same network, we just need a different UI for editing. Since the twitter-like systems already carry links to stories written by people on desktops, there's room in their pipes for our writing too. And it can work more efficiently if the stories are part of the message as opposed to living off-site. Think of it as a web of writing. A writer's web that also carries short messages.</description>

			<description>I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/20/warningMuskCouldPushTrumpOverTheTop.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; this morning about the reality of Musk owning Twitter, which is now completely settling in. He might have enough influence on the election to push Trump over. He wins even if Trump loses, he gets a moon mission project to boot up a Musk Party. It's coming for sure, either way. Probably will pick up what's left over after Trump, who clearly is losing it, and even if he's president, someone else will be pulling the strings. I can't imagine the billionaire will let JD Vance do it. And by &quot;billionaire&quot; I mean Musk.</description>

			<description>A second elimination game for the Mets tonight. I almost don't want the Mets to win, because the World Series opponent from the &quot;other&quot; league are the Janks from the Bronx. I love the Bronx. That's about all I have to say about that at this time.</description>

			<description>It's possible the Dodgers let the Mets win as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/18.html#a144749&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to yesterday, but it's also possible the Mets just &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/live/dodgers-vs-mets-new-york-bats-come-alive-in-game-5-sending-series-back-to-los-angeles-201027428.html&quot;&gt;crushed&lt;/a&gt; the Dodgers, but either way, the Mets are still in it. The series is now 3-2, and returns to Los Angeles tomorrow. So we don't have to tear down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field&quot;&gt;Citi Field&lt;/a&gt; after all. If the Dodgers win it'll be in their own stadium. The Mets were magnificent! Absolutely inspiring. A three-run home run by Alonso started things off. Everyone got on base. Doubles and triples. It wasn't without the concern that our wonderful and lovable Mets would do the usual Mets thing and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they held out. The final score was 12-6. We're still in it. Lets go Mets!</description>

			<description>Bloggers, here's an idea. When you write a piece you're proud of, end it with a sentence like this: &quot;And that's why I have a blog.&quot; It plants a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We've had a lot of mud slung at us, let's start undoing that.</description>

And the most important thing -- they don't break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly. It means it's safe to develop here. It means there's discipline in their development organization. Most companies don't do this, but the ones who do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft's sins, they were incredibly good at this too. It's why I liked working with them, and also why we laughed at each others' jokes if you can believe that. In some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the concept of &quot;development org&quot; -- so I look at it that way. I dig around their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it'll work out pretty well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they're going to break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and completeness. They didn't rush off to the next thing before finishing. I found that in their Calypso API, which I've been building on. Honestly this is my kind of platform, it's what Manila's API would look like today probably if we had continued developing it. I'll see if I can find the docs around here somewhere. Long time ago. ;-)</description>

It should be as easy as reading a file. Give it the URL of a feed, get back a JavaScript object that's as simple as feeds are. It can read RSS, Atom and RDF feeds, but you get the same object regardless of what form the feed was in. I'm up for creating some example apps if you're interested. There is a very simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/example&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt; included in the package and a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos&quot;&gt;demo apps&lt;/a&gt;. It's MIT-licensed, so you can do whatever you want with the code. It would lovely to see it ported. The idea is to plant some seeds in the Node.js world to make it easy for developers to try out new ideas with feeds, figuring the easier it is, the more people will do it. Be creative. Blow our minds! :-)</description>

Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I'd say no. In 2003, I compiled a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/&quot;&gt;things that make a blog a blog&lt;/a&gt;, and it's not about the software you use, rather it's about who's writing it, and whether they're being edited. Now it's a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not. Because it forces you to use their editor. And that's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious&quot;&gt;pernicious&lt;/a&gt; form of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can't easily try out something new. You are not available to other software developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you. I know how well that kind of system works. And that's probably why they lock you into using their editor. If I can't switch without breaking everything, I'm not going there.</description>

It could both save and kill us. That's what's so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people aren't really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it might also kill you because you can't go back to being the person you were before. There might not be a path back. One thing's for sure we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; saving. We can't survive without radical change. We're on a path that doesn't work. Is there any way for us to change radically without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up control. But here's the funny thing about that. We aren't giving up anything because no one has any control. That's a political question in the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control. But he's 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could configure AI so it did what humans can't and won't do, at least our civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which is why I have a blog.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This morning I wrote about why I don't believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets pitcher Tug McGraw. It's on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter how it turns out I won't love the Mets any less if they lose. I think true believers believe in that -- love -- without any expectations, win or lose, or maybe &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering of the post isn't complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I'm working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I'm glad to see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in the things I believe in, not because I &quot;gotta.&quot; I don't like the slogan because it doesn't reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand that their fans don't love them any less because they lost. If anything I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wait+till+next+year!&quot;&gt;Wait till next year!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
