			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/05/12/chairmanMeow.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I just realized that there's another kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification&quot;&gt;enshitification&lt;/a&gt; that we're experiencing now because the twitter-verse has split into so many forks. Bluesky is hot now, but this isn't over yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Developers are deliberately locking their users in by creating new APIs that are not only incompatible with previously existing APIs, but also are difficult for developers who learned earlier APIs to adopt because now they have all kinds of replicated code for different systems. It adds another level of complexity to the developer's code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What each platform vendor wants is not only captive users, but also locked-in developers. Why do you think they all have new languages? Come on is Swift really better than Go or React or whatever. Groups of Mac developers constantly spinning their wheels to keep up with Apple breaking releases. Groups of JavaScript developers. And there are many &lt;i&gt;kinds&lt;/i&gt; of JS devs. When does it end. Ones who build on OpenAI and others that develop on the APIs of other vendors (I'm not even trying to go on that ride, too late in my career.) There's so much confusion, that leads to exhaustion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we're feeling it especially hard when there are such ill-conceived duplicate APIs that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; could have been done with RSS 2.0 and OPML.  Every one of them. Cory Doctorow, who came up with the term enshitification, also wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise&quot;&gt;passionate piece about RSS&lt;/a&gt;. I want to say to my friend Cory, if a system isn't built on RSS at this point, they are certainly trying to lock users and developers in. I don't care if it's ActivityPub or ATProto or Facebook or Meta or X or Twitter (sorry I can't keep up with their names). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to build on a system that's pure inbound and outbound RSS. Give me lists in OPML and the please just let me ignore the rest of your lockin strategy. They talk a good line about wanting interop, federation and standards, but their actions speak otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At a conference the CEO of twitter-splitter Bluesky said her product is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html&quot;&gt;billionaire-proof&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't seem too likely to me that it is. And maybe they're quoting her incorrectly. A billionaire could take it over and the users would have no recourse, the whole thing would blow up even more quickly than Twitter is (and I'm not convinced it has blown up, there still seems to be a lot going on there, I think perhaps people are exaggerating how polluted it is or maybe I'm being shielded by an algorithm). It would be nice to use a system that is truly billionaire-proof. How about building a network on top of something else that is 100 percent RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, RSS is probably the closest to billionaire-proof. I don't get royalties on it, lots of people have tried to make big bucks from it, but so far its only allegiance is to people who want to publish and receive news. If a billionaire could buy it, they probably would have by now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

She didn't start broadcasting until three months before the election. That's not even one season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Elementary&quot;&gt;Abbott Elementary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show)&quot;&gt;Wheel of Fortune&lt;/a&gt;. Of course they didn't know her. That's because the Dems go off the air &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1854036662952620232&quot;&gt;on Election Day&lt;/a&gt; and don't show up again for three years. Meanwhile the other party is on the air 24 hours a day, every day of every year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next time we nominate a candidate, the voters will already know them and like them. No more of the &quot;we don't know her well enough.&quot; That's what mattered. They want a sense that they know who you are. The same way kids of my generation knew who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker&quot;&gt;Archie Bunker&lt;/a&gt; was, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maude_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Maude&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore&quot;&gt;Mary Tyler Moore&lt;/a&gt;. That's where trust comes from. We may not have liked Archie Bunker's politics, but we knew who he was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time so when we choose a candidate the people will already know and like them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-setback-for-trump-as-gopers-privately-tell-him/id1728152109?i=1000677605316&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; where Greg Sargent and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-cabinet-team-of-outlaws-gaetz-hegseth-gabbard-rfk&quot;&gt;guest&lt;/a&gt; kept saying &quot;we gotta figure this out.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/27/successionPoster.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The answer is staring you in the face. Dems are only on the air for a few months every four years. Of course the other side spins you like crazy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You all are clinging to the &quot;gotcha&quot; model of journalism. There are no more gotchas. We've known that since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape&quot;&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of the new Democratic Party will be comfortable in their own skin. They tell you what they think. Fetterman, AOC, Tammy Baldwin. There will be many of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying. When you say nothing people think you agree with them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's get the Dems back on the air before the inauguration. I'll kick in $100 to get it started, and I'll tell everyone I know to fund it too. There's no time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/21/wozAndJobs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Woz and Jobs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What matters with social networks is what you can get done there, not so much the features of the network. Bluesky has the same features today it had a month ago. The difference is we had an election in the US, I guess that was the catalyst. The presence of Elon Musk so close to Trump says there is a need for a Musk-free place. I've kept my account on Twitter. I started there in 2006, and I love the web more than I feel it would do any good to erase my presence there. It's pretty much against my religion to deliberately erase bits of the web. And whatever you think of Twitter, it is most definitely part of the web.</description>

			<title>Bluesky feature request</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky devs.. How about a compromise. Support inbound RSS. Let me enter the URL of an RSS feed in settings. I'll ping a fixed location when the feed updates. Would allow the same flow to go to other systems. This would help a lot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Imagine a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any blogging tool that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that could be created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.) &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood basis for interop. It's a brilliant competitive move, if they really intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their competitors to follow suit. I don't doubt that Mastodon would do it. And Threads might even do it if they're feeling competitive with Bluesky. They've already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that's been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should take a small fraction of the time to adapt.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn't be tremendously surprised if they actually did it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Feedback on sez.us sign up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why I haven't created an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sez.us/&quot;&gt;sez.us&lt;/a&gt; yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info later, after I've created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to the next screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then they ask for my phone number. That's when I hit the back button. I already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren't good there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don't mind providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up front.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also I don't like white on black letters. It's hard for me to read. All the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an option if it's important to you, but please default to black on white.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer asked&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, in and out.

If it's bought by someone who wants to use it the way Musk has, they can, without any recourse by the users. As they said in the old days, if you're getting something for free, you're the product, not the customer. We helped Musk build a way to excercise political power against our interests. You may think Bluesky is a way of fixing that, but it probably isn't. They're digging a deep hole, probably too deep to climb out of at this point. They did some innovative stuff, perhaps.

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/15/maybe-bluesky-has-won&quot;&gt;Excellent piece&lt;/a&gt; on how Bluesky leaves users with the impression that it's open and decentralized in ways it is not. If it's bought by someone who wants to use it the way Musk has, they can, without any recourse by the users. As they said in the old days, if you're getting something for free, you're the product, not the customer. We helped Musk build a way to excercise political power against our interests. You may think Bluesky is a way of fixing that, but it probably isn't. They're digging a deep hole, probably too deep to climb out of at this point. They did some innovative stuff, perhaps. But they ended up at the same place, it appears, as Twitter did." created="Sat, 16 Nov 2024 20:06:17 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/04/15/theEggman.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/16.html#a200617"/>

My goal is to speed up development and reduce wear and tear on me. Once we're confident it really works as advertised, we'll open up the testing further. There will be a form you can fill out to get in the queue. The choice of the first testers will be highly subjective.</description>

			<description>BTW, start thinking of WordPress as a highly networked, deployed, debugged, widely supported &lt;b&gt;network operating system&lt;/b&gt;. It meets all the criteria. It also has storage. And can publish. And unlike other social web systems, it is textcasting-ready since it comes from the world of blogging where we competed to give writers the features they needed. We can build lots of apps on this foundation.</description>

			<description>There isnâ€™t a single social web network that I like pouring my creativity into. I feel like Iâ€™m being used not appreciated. Thereâ€™s nothing in it for me. I had a similar feeling for Twitter, but they were the only one. Now there are a bunch, and I honestly don't care about any of them, esp now that the election is over. I think this whole idea of feeding the greed of a bunch of tech people is over. If there's a good place to gather, with a small number of people I relate to as people, then I'm up for that, but none of these services meet that need.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT can't remember my coding conventions. It always falls back to using features of JavaScript I told it not to use. I indent my code according to the way it works in an outliner, so I can't use their code without having to manually modify it. I haven't forgotten that I'm the human and it's the computer.

			<title>Are you the nerd of the year??</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you ask for something with Bluesky they tell you about how a user account is like a website, you just have to make it work a certain way, that some devs have mastered, and I guess I could too, but right now all my attention is focused on WordPress and getting it to work well with ActivityPub so my editor can get directly into the Mastodon network and possibly with Threads too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what about Bluesky which is growing like a weed now??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might be easy for the right person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Come up with an interface that makes it so that a WordPress blog is just a user on the Bluesky network.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They have a nice API, I've just spent a year implementing on top of it. I imagine for someone who knows both WordPress and Bluesky this might be a weekend project? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Do it, and blow our minds! There's a lot of content out there in WordPress and a lot of people publish on it.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the best part of it is that it totally drives adoption of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; which is my not so hidden agenda. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And for the people who are starting to think it's only an ActivityPub thing, think again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you do this you might not win the Nobel Peace Prize but you will be Nerd of the Year in my book! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

On August 12 of this year, I tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3kzjvirjq3d2q&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the NYT makes Trump sound like a reasonable candidate that a sane person might vote for, remember this day.&quot; I included a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/trumpIncitesMob.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the front page of the NYT on Jan 7, 2021. One in three Trump voters still &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/froomkin/status/1856384929476624841&quot;&gt;watch mainstream news&lt;/a&gt;, which follows the lead of the NYT, and if they had been straight with us, perhaps enough people who like Trump's style would have realized the danger, and voted in a conservative way, ie to conserve the Constitution. Because of how they covered it, we now get to re-run the 2016 experiment all over again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trump-won-what-now-with-heather-cox-richardson/id1583132133?i=1000676185735&quot;&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/a&gt; points out in Jon Stewart's weekly podcast (a must-listen) -- we have more experience too, and perhaps will know better how to deal with Trump and know that &lt;b&gt;his bark is often worse than his bite.&lt;/b&gt; I have to say as the new reality sinks in, I'm not as scared as I was on Election Night last week or even Election Night in 2016. A lot of people will sell out this time who didn't before. But the problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,  and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears. You think inflation was bad? This will be far worse and it's happening now, and nothing we can do at a human scale will make it go away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're dealing with a very unusual drought in the eastern US now. Fires are breaking out where we never used to have them. Yeah this shit is real, and even people who don't believe in science are feeling it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As someone once said, you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/xdc8t4/never_let_a_good_crisis_go_to_waste/&quot;&gt;never waste a good crisis&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of other people feel compelled to move. Unfortunately some are moving to the wrong place, as they always do. Making change isn't easy, but is possible, if you understand how people move. As they try to figure out what the Dem's failed at, that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Skate to where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1bvv11l/i_skate_to_where_the_puck_is_going_to_be_not/&quot;&gt;puck will be&lt;/a&gt;, not where it was, as another famous philosopher once said. And people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors (which I said, sadly, but then put that fact to use to get various standards to fly by without debate). There is a method to human madness, in other words, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Update: My guess is that they haven't released enough code to run a Bluesky of your own, because all the answers from people who say they know say the same thing -- &quot;It doesn't work that way.&quot; You &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; write your own, but if we were to do that, why use their one-off API, use a standard instead, and we might have a chance to interop with other systems in a meaningful way. I don't blame them for wanting to cash out, but I do blame them for conning people into believing it's some kind of escape. Until I hear otherwise Bluesky is a dead-end, not worth investing your hope in. If you're migrating from Twitter this is no better. Keep looking. But I promise to let you know if I get any info that changes my opinion, so if I've got it wrong, people from Bluesky, just answer the freaking question in the post at the top of this page. Thanks.</description>

We could have led here because most of the innovators in this space vote Democratic, but the leadership doesn't listen. The voters could get to know all the stars of the parties. People were right when they said they didn't know Harris. It's time to let the leaders rise from the net, not just from the insiders. This is how you do it.</description>

One way to do it is with my product &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. It manages news streams for feeds you subscribe to. I think every publication should share news from feeds they depend on, experts they quote, other news sources they read. We can build our own networks this way. The advantage of this approach is that it is truly decentralized and not at all complicated to use. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news stream&lt;/a&gt; I provide for readers of my blog. It's the most popular feature on the site. With FeedLand you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.feedland.com/newsproducts.md&quot;&gt;create your own&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Democratic mistakes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've actually written a lot, but haven't wanted to publish most of it. So many reasons why the Dems lost. Maybe I should just list them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden shouldn't have run again. There would have been a primary. Given the result of the election this week, we should have found out what support each candidate had with voters. We didn't get to choose the candidate. That said Harris ran a fantastic campaign. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden should not have shut down his campaign website. Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. &lt;b&gt;We were not part of governing&lt;/b&gt;. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama. This is probably the biggest single mistake the Dems keep making.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We needed a prosecutor at the top of Justice. I don't know what Garland actually did, but I'm sure it will all be swept out by whoever is Trump's AG. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Men's votes need to be sought and welcomed, specifically. So much has been done to alienate male voters, which is why so many voted for Trump. We could have had a bunch of them this year, if we had only spoken to them with respect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if we can reboot the Democrats as an opposition party given all these problems. Whatever comes next is going to perform very differently from the party that lost this election. If we try to do it again the same old way, it will fail even worse. I think everyone knows this by now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In 2016, on the night of Election Day, when it was obvious Trump would win, before taking a Xanax and going to sleep, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, that my friend Chuck Shotton &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social/post/3labvjcfh2j2k&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; I should run again. Rather than doing that, I'll quote the important part. &quot;I don't think it's about economics, I think it's about change happening too fast. And the Trump voters had the power to bring it to a screeching halt, they saw the chance and took it.&quot;</description>

			<description>First thing -- &lt;b&gt;Don't shut down the campaign&lt;/b&gt;. We must keep communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down. Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing. And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero after election, whether we win or lost.</description>

			<description>Blame is pointless. It may be emotionally satisfying at some level, but it is division, and that's why we keep losing elections. We don't see it but we create our own divisions. This must stop.</description>
