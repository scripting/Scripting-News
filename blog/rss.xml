			<description>There are two quotes that make me laugh in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;Think Different&lt;/a&gt; piece from last week. One of them is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#:~:text=They%20took%20paradise%20and%20blew%20big%20holes%20in%20it%20that%20users%20couldn't%20find%20a%20way%20out%20of.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;They took paradise and..&quot; At first, if you're roughly my age, you read &quot;They took paradise and...&quot; and recognize it as the beginning of a famous line from Joni Mitchell's &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Joni-mitchell-big-yellow-taxi-lyrics&quot;&gt;Big Yellow Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. The other is a subtle touch of sarcasm, that I usually try not to indulge in, but let pass through as I edited this piece. See if you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; it.</description>

It's time for Mastodon to adopt these features across the board, so when writing in Masto you can use linking, style, titles, 10K character limit. Raise the bar.

			<description>If I were running Bluesky I’d have a quiet project to make a lite Bluesky server that peers with the mother ship, highly factored, in a Node package, open source of course. Get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil&quot;&gt;snake oil&lt;/a&gt; phase behind them, where they’re claiming to be decentralized, but aren’t.</description>

			<description>I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.com/blog/keep-exploring/&quot;&gt;what Vivaldi says&lt;/a&gt; about the web. It makes me want to do more to re-stock the web with interesting, inspiring &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; ideas. Maybe we could make our blogging software work better with their browser.

			<description>Everything Trump is doing to steal the next election is proof of why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Anderson&quot;&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; was right to deny him a place on the 2024 ballot. The Supremes gave him four years to prepare, to learn from his mistakes, now he'll do it from the top seat. It seems certain to work.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVadolr8eFs&quot;&gt;Short excerpt&lt;/a&gt; of the ICE commercial which aired several times on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPIX&quot;&gt;WPIX&lt;/a&gt; during yesterday's Mets game. There aren't that many drug trafficker, predatory gang members in the US for ICE to deport. And they completely misrepresent what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city&quot;&gt;sanctuary city&lt;/a&gt; is. The commercial is paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Shameful.</description>

			<title>The Mets have arrived</title>

And the Mets, my team since 1962, are really exciting right now, after a month of being lost. They have great rookie pitchers who are full of youthful enthusiasm and they kick ass on the mound. They have veterans who understand their job is to lead and they take that responsibility seriously, and they get on base, steal bases, and hit home runs. And they have workaday athletes who get on base when the team needs a hit. And the most expensive player ever in any sport who's finally playing as part of the team and not someone who misses the old team he used to play on. And they still have the most ridiculously dorky mascot, a caricature of a human with a baseball for a head, and his wife who also has a baseball for a head. Where do they come up with these ideas? Doesn't matter it's the M-E-T-S of New York town who we will now step right up to meet, and greet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Glad to finally get the whole plan down in one place. Each piece of the puzzle took a while to come together in concept and then in implementation. I'm still working on all levels, last week I added a feature to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; that makes it fit in better with the (new) timeline and WordPress (20+ years). It takes a while to change your thinking from WordPress being just another blogging CMS, to being an open platform that hosts &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;web writing&lt;/a&gt; in a way that's open to competition. We're on the same page. It's still a competitive environment, but there are rules to competing, you don't cash in the interop that took patience and respect to develop and maintain. That's been the pity of the open web, lots of opportunists who are willing to stink up the ecosystem to squeeze a few more bucks for themselves from things &lt;i&gt;they didn't create.&lt;/i&gt; Let your competitors in, and the users, if they have their heads screwed on right, will respect you for it. And even if they don't, still do it, because it's the right thing to do. That's why, at my age, just turned 70 earlier this year, I'm in a position to help revive the web, because I've made enough money, now it's time to make sure the gift that I got from the open web is available to future generations, no matter how greedy and selfish the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/08/29/the-wealthy-and-dominant-giants-of-tech/&quot;&gt;giants of tech&lt;/a&gt; are. People may question Matt, and that's cool, as I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a142100&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, but also remember he's stood up for your freedom, and that's also important.</description>

			<title>Bronx Science, in retrospect</title>

			<title>Think Different about WordPress</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs asked you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different&quot;&gt;think differently&lt;/a&gt; about computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjgtLSHhTPg&quot;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; to think differently about WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to make you wait to hear what it is. I want you to see WordPress as comparable to Bluesky or Mastodon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've done this before -- asked people to think differently about things, like public writing, with blogging. In the 90s I was running around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Vallley&lt;/a&gt; trying to explain to everyone that blogging was going to change everything, all I got was blank stares from people who said &quot;we don't do that.&quot; They of course eventually did do it. But at first the ideas seemed foreign, unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and podcasting. We needed to seed these things, get the ideas in front of people with actual products, with real utility for users. And eventually they came around. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm going to ask you to think differently about WordPress, something you thought you already fully understood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Internally, the software, WordPress, Mastodon, Bluesky, do a lot of the same things. But because WordPress is so long-lived relative to the other two, it's more complete, scaled, it federates easily, lots of people do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;important features&lt;/a&gt; the other two don't, although some Mastodon instances are more relaxed about character limits, linking, titles on posts and editing. These are important features. But because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/home&quot;&gt;mother ship&lt;/a&gt; doesn't support all of them, it's hard to represent it without the limits. This can be fixed easily, btw. Just being analytic about it. I like Mastodon and ActivityPub because they provide interop, and that's the name of the game. Make your product but don't lock users in. Interop is your way out if you need to get out. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress has excellent support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, esp using a little-known feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/rssCloud/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. It enables realtime notification of new or changed feed items. It's been around since 2009, and like all of WordPress, it's thorougly debugged and scaled. I use it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. If you watch the blogroll on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; on the web, you'll see it in action. Or if you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, leave it running and watch the new items show up in realtime without you having to do anything. That's rssCloud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;WordPress has a deep and powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js/tree/master/docs&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, well designed, documented, and they don't break it. Developers who know me know that the last part is the most important. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; must remain unchanging. That means you have to put in a lot of thought up front, and then live with your mistakes, providing &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=continuity&quot;&gt;continuity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The API has barely been used by developers. Huge amount of potential there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's open source, of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It has a large support industry built around it, you can get a lot of help in setting up and running an instance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I, Dave Winer, am part of this now, have been for a couple of years, working relatively quietly, building out what I think WordPress needs to get started in this new direction. I am going to help bootstrap a great developer community around all these capabilities. This is something people didn't count on. I have an incredible track record of establishing popular APIs and developer communities. I know how to do this, even wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to how to do it, which apparently has helped other developers create and work on open platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've done three things that will help the bootstrap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apps&lt;/b&gt;. Like MacWrite and MacPaint, someone has to go first, to share basic ideas about how the user interface will work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;b&gt;storage service&lt;/b&gt; where the user owns their writing, so it can be edited by any app they give permission to. This means that app developers don't have to be resellers of storage. This is the biggest economic limiting factor to a large innovative, truly entrepreneurial developer community. Every other network arrangement requires you to raise money or be fearful of having huge support and monetary overhead if you attract too many users. When the Mac market booted up it had none of these limits, the users bought the hardware, we made the software. The web has &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; had the equivalent runtime environment. I'm going to run the server for you to get the bootstrap going. My treat. Until we can get help from infrastructure owners to host the service. And if you want to host it for yourself, it's open source, so you will be able to, without anyone's permission.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content&lt;/b&gt;. We won't have to wait for new writers to start using my service. Thanks to RSS there will be plenty of feeds in a form that is surprisingly like the data that flows through the other systems. We will carry writing from Substack and Ghost, for example. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the WordPress world I have to tell you how I feel about the 800-pound gorilla, Automattic. Whatever you think -- key point -- &lt;i&gt;they didn't lock you in.&lt;/i&gt; The community, which I'm just getting to know is very circumspect about everything and that's good and right. It's based on the reality that you never know when or how you're going to lose your freedom, so you always have to watch out. I have looked at this from the inside, from the API and the history, and I've gotten to know a few people at the company, and I trust certain things about them. I don't think they'll necessarily listen to you, or me -- and they can get in the way, but I'm willing to take a chance that they won't.  They've kept their open source promise and they run a stable platform. Linux is that way, it offers that kind of stability, and so does WordPress. Much of the world, myself included, haven't paid much attention to WordPress and we have only used a small fraction of its potential. I'm going to try to build on and unlock for other developers, a whole new side of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing you should know -- I'm not in it for the money. I just want to help the web heal from all the abuses  it has taken over the years. They took paradise and blew big holes in it that users couldn't find a way out of. They undermined open formats and protocols. They lied to the users, all the time, over and over. Now I don't object to making money, but I'm putting it out there, you can compete with me, I want you to compete with me, as long as you don't try to cut off the interop. And I'm not naive, believe me, I expect that will happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/einstein.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Everyone has heard of WordPress, right? I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages. And arrange them chronologically and in relation to other messages and people. But WordPress does it better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Big bird in my pool</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I did an unusual podcast about three huge birds fighting over a fish in a nearby pond. Usually I write and talk about technology or politics, but this was such a compelling story and I didn't have any photos or video, so I did a verbal story. Hope you enjoyed it. Well now I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I went out to my pool, there was one of the big birds, in the pool. He couldn't get out. The pool is fenced in, as it must be, to keep animals and children from drowning, and the fence was too tall for the bird to fly out, or so it seemed. When it spotted me, it freaked out and tried to squeeze through the fence, which was impossible, the holes in the fence were too small for his sizeable body. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bird did eventually manage to fly out, thankfully -- maybe I'll do another verbal podcast to explain why that was such an accomplishment. But for right now I just want to share the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/bird.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The big &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU&quot;&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; in the pool. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every &quot;page&quot; on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web. So for example, an iPhone app isn't on the web just because it has an information page that is.</description>

			<description>I'm working my way through Mr Robot, for the third time I think. If you want to know what I do, it's like what Elliot does, for about four hours pretty much every day. I used to work longer hours but I've found this amount of work is optimal. I make more mistakes after about 1PM. Anyway Mr Robot is a very good thing to watch for the times we live in. The technology is already a little outdated, but they thought of that, there are some scenes where they use old PCs from the 80s, with total respect. I like that. And the utilities he uses are pretty much the same ones I use these days. And the context of a world in technological meltdown, I think that's a very realistic scenario. I don't see how our networks can't avoid breaking down. And our health care system, which these days is pretty much the same thing.</description>

			<description>I think perhaps I should have one day every week where I never link to anything. Just to provide a demo of what the web would be like without linking. Which is most of the sites that say they are part of the web. I think that's a lie we should stop tolerating. Or maybe I should just stop offsite linking for one day a week. That would be interesting wouldn't it. Or I could charge extra for the version with the links. (It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; done that at times.)</description>

(It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; done that at times.)" created="Tue, 26 Aug 2025 16:40:59 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/08/26.html#a164059"/>

			<description>I asked, yesterday, on various social media sites, for people's opinion on what the term &quot;on the web&quot; means. I'm going to compile the answers on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/web/what.opml&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt;, and then ask some follow-up questions. If you have an opinion, post a comment on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lx6ww3lqx22q&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/115087015889672419&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.com/@davew/post/DNwtUao3FZL&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1959803988733288674&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I've been exchanging emails and voicemails with &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/dpknauss/&quot;&gt;Dan Knauss&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime WordPress developer and one of the hosts of WordCamp Canada which I am speaking at in October. Learning a lot about the community and culture. I wonder, have I ever been part of a community that's over 20 years old? I can't think of one off the top of my head. I have gotten this far without knowing much about the WordPress community, other than what I've heard via Matt and what I've been able to infer from that. I've known Matt since he was a teenage boy wonder in the tech industry working at CNET and then as an entrepreneur. I think my point of view is a new one, I don't bring much baggage with me. I am generally sympathetic with Matt, having been the leader of the blogging world when it started, and found it a pretty thankless place, a position I was happy to relinquish in 2003 when I went to academia.</description>

			<description>There's a fresh release of the docs for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/&quot;&gt;WordPress API&lt;/a&gt; we use in WordLand. I actually liked that the docs were old and kind of dusty. It says that the engineering culture is to not mess around with things that developers have already built on. A lot of platforms break developers without much thought. I learned a long time ago that when you do that, you lose the interest of developers, understandably.</description>

			<description>I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience. I wrote about this a few years back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/phoenix/&quot;&gt;Developing Better Developers&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Trump's secret was comedy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump is a comedian. He makes people laugh the way Joan Rivers or Don Rickles did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's verbal slapstick, which is for some reason I don't understand immensely funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Newsom is making us laugh by imitating Trump imitating Joan and Don. It's working. He must keep doing it, and he should evolve the schtick, he should make Trump match &lt;i&gt;him. &lt;/i&gt;And where Trump is promoting depraved policies with his comedy, we can count on Newsom to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law and all the progress we've made. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He can invite famous comedians on his podcast to play opposite him, sometimes the straight man, playing their SNL roles. So much potential. He's got the attention, don't throw it away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Politics was boring, it's not boring anymore. But there's no reason excitement and entertainment can't be good for us too! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump's secret is comedy and Newsom is stealing his thunder&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone.</description>

I wasn't in any way intending on provoking a conversation like that here. So I'm going to delete the comments that have gone off in that direction, and please don't post any more. I don't mind you having that conversation, but do it somewhere else where I don't have to read it. Thanks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere that's the only structure for discourse we've created. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can do better. I have to create my own system to prove it, so much work, but worth it, I expect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We now look for feeds from wordpress sites, and copy the site ID and the ID for each post as channel-level &lt;i&gt;wpSiteId&lt;/i&gt; and item-level &lt;i&gt;wpPostId. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdaveverse.org%2Ffeed%2F&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. This will make &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Edit%20This%20Page%22&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; functionality possible in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; product I'm building now. This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql&quot;&gt;FeedLand level&lt;/a&gt; (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)</description>

			<description>Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make&quot;&gt;Make your own world&lt;/a&gt;. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)</description>

			<title>What podcasting is</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A standard format for recording. MP3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dermotcasey.bsky.social/post/3lwtrlfyo6s23&quot;&gt;Dermot Casey&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'd add Dave to this list.

They just allocated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/&quot;&gt;$170 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.</description>

			<description>I had an idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalvoices.org/&quot;&gt;Global Voices&lt;/a&gt;, at least in concept, could help us prepare in the US for what's coming. I wrote: I'd love to have is an &lt;b&gt;idea-sharing network&lt;/b&gt; where i could drop this idea in a box named &quot;helping the US stay free&quot; and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying &quot;if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!&quot; That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades.</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/10/09/mrBurns.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.bingeworthy.org/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-dropout%2F&quot;&gt;The Dropout&lt;/a&gt; on Hulu. It's hard to watch at times, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes&quot;&gt;main character&lt;/a&gt; of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell&quot;&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.</description>
