			<description>We could follow the clues in the TrumpLand with more gusto. They know their numbers are bad and likely to get worse, they did the things that made it the numbers bad. And at the same time they don't seem to care? If this were a mystery show, like Dallas or Succession or Severance, Lost perhaps, what would you think?</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/baselineplayground/index.html&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt; of what a story page might look like on our baseline site for WordLand. I did this off on the side as input for the WordPress theme. I find it easier to work on style in a standalone page without much tech that can get in the way of fast iteration.</description>

			<title>How blogs show their site title</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're working on the &quot;baseline&quot; theme for WordLand, the default -- the one that shows the user's writing in a WordPress context. I did a survey of news sites and blogs to see how they show their titles:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-says-ny-budget-will-create-50m-rental-aid-program-championed-by-tenant-groups&quot;&gt;Gothamist&lt;/a&gt; puts the name in the upper left corner, leaving room for some buttons and a menu in the right corner.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/redditor-accidentally-reinvents-discarded-90s-tool-to-escape-todays-age-gates/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; does something similar, name of site in upper left corner, with an array of buttons flush right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/04/30/three-coequal-timelines-of-government/&quot;&gt;Empty Wheel&lt;/a&gt; does the same thing. (I sense a pattern here.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-lawmakers-should-reject-fake-chaplains-in-schools-bill/&quot;&gt;Missouri Independent&lt;/a&gt; centers the title in much bigger type than the previous examples, the buttons are arrayed above it (more buttons).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://evgrieve.com/2025/04/east-village-mainstay-cafe-mogador.html&quot;&gt;EV Grieve&lt;/a&gt; puts the name in the upper left corner without much fanfare. Proves that it doesn't have to be eye-catching, it's the attitude and the content I love. One of my longtime favorites. It's an East Village neighborhood blog, running in Blogger for ages.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/2025/04/uncomfortable-ideas/&quot;&gt;Seth's Blog&lt;/a&gt; is a WordPress site, managed by Automattic. The left sidebar includes the title of the blog, and has a list of things he wants you to read, and how to get on his mail list, etc. So effectively the title is in the upper left corner, and the equiv of the buttons are arrayed vertically in a column. The functionality of his blog is probably closest to what I have in mind for WordLand, but into spartan beginnings. It's easy to add stuff, impossible to take away.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/#atom-everything&quot;&gt;Simon Willison's Weblog&lt;/a&gt;, another great example of the kind of writing I want people to do with WordLand. He puts the title in the upper left corner, with a single button flush right. He deals with the recent articles thing by putting a list of three posts, linkblog style, at the bottom. I like this placement, btw. Positioned as an afterthought. If you're lingering here, you might like this? I pretty much always ignore this kind of stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2025/04/29/model-train-at-the-casey.html&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt; does the same thing everyone else is doing. Title at the top left, an array of buttons flush-right at the same level. What's uncommon about his style is that the name of his blog is tiny, 13px. But it also is very visible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/25/04/0046739-trump-is-a-hallucinating-&quot;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt; does not include the title of his blog on a story page. This is remarkable. But he does have the author name very prominently placed, it's the very topmost text on the page, impossible to miss. So amazingly the title is visible, even though it isn't there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/&quot;&gt;Pluralistic&lt;/a&gt; puts the title in big type flush left, with a subtitle, and the buttons are below the title, before the headline of the post (lots of white space separating).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT use-case for reporters -- fact-checking. Feed a draft of your story into ChatGPT and ask if it spots any factual errors. There may be some false positives, so you can ask another AI chatbot, or investigate yourself elsewhere. It may miss some. But it couldn't hurt and it might help.</description>

			<description>New howto: &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/feedland/editingSubscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;Editing subscription lists&lt;/a&gt;. I'm doing a project with a friend who hasn't used &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. I want him to maintain a subscription list which will then be the source for a Bluesky account. Any time the OPML changes, of course, the channel adjusts, so they have full power to add and remove feeds. &quot;Just enough FeedLand.&quot;</description>

Usually I don't criticize a service when it's down, because I can relate. We like to help each other when there are outages. But Bluesky is special, because they claim to be decentralized. If it were, it wouldn't go down unless the internet itself had. And since the internet, amazingly, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; decentralized, that's not likely to happen. It was designed that way when it was developed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET&quot;&gt;Arpanet&lt;/a&gt;, a project of the US Department of Defense. It was designed to survive a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Inspiration&quot;&gt;nuclear strike&lt;/a&gt;. Bluesky is nice, but it's fragile, and their hype says otherwise. That's why they're special. They should straighten this out so we can properly get decentralization into &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; networks. Bluesky could easily add a layer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; on top of what they have, so that news flow could survive a disaster.  In 2025 this is a realistic concern, as it was in the 1960s. Also it would be nice if other network experts would support this, esp if they're on Bluesky. This is not personal, if they wanted to get the RSS layer built, I would help them do it. We should all pitch in because then it would really be our network, and not owned by anyone. Live up to the promise, now.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; defines a network of services and readers. Each one can go down, but the whole network stays up. That's all that Bluesky has promised, and that's why a layer of RSS on top of Bluesky would deliver a huge portion of the stability they've promised and would need to survive a disaster. It could be done in a matter of weeks, if they decided to do it. I would help.</description>

I worked through the whole tree of possibilities with ChatGPT and it came to the conclusion that the source was an out of date package, and it was confident if I replaced it with the one &quot;everyone else&quot; is using, the problems will go away. Now this is the moment when human judgement prevails. I'm going to experiment in a very small app first, to make sure I have the approach right, then I will cautiously make the change on my test WordLand server, and if it works there, then I will figure out how to install it on the main site. It couldn't break all that much because for some reason the WS code stopped working, completely, with no code changes anywhere.</description>

			<description>Well it looks like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/27/130611.html&quot;&gt;new email app&lt;/a&gt; is working. I got some really nice lookin emails last night, hope you did too. Subscribe &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And there's a basis on which to build. I will now proceed to turn off the old email app that has been serving us so well since 2017 or thereabouts. Goodbye old friend. Hello new world!</description>

			<title>Dems get on the air!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m sick of saying this &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lnunfkdru22h&quot;&gt;over and over&lt;/a&gt;, the Dems need a regular snark-filled irreverent presence on social media to condemn every freaking fascist thing the Trumps do. They had it with the Kamala accounts, but they shut them down on Election Day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s so freaking simple. Not having a raging presence on social media in the future will be seen as like a successful company not being listed on the NYSE, or a country not having a rep at the United Nations. Aside from the cost of keeping a staff online 24x7, it's free, and serves as its own money-raising channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Repubs figured this out in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe what the Dems need is some entrepreneurs and comedians at the top to actually get through to voters that say &quot;Hey we're the Dems, we're here and we love America and we love you, Americans!&quot; And actually make a stink when they try to kill Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another purpose -- tell people when the next pandemic is here. You know the Trumps aren't going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Lots of news reports about Trump's polls. But it isn't surprising that in the transition from a democracy to autocracy the people would become increasingly unhappy with the change, until we basically give up, and the polls from some pollsters are always this way, but the polls from others tell a different story. Fox News still runs polls the old way, as does the NYT and others. But that will change, as the lawyers have, and the Washington Post and NY Times have, in their editorial functions. And they just arrested a judge in Wisconsin. Makes you think maybe it doesn't matter if the polls say what they say, if there isn't something behind them.</description>

They had keynotes and panels about stuff I was working on at the time, in the 90s and 00s, blogging, RSS, podcasting, bringing blogs to politics. He wouldn't take my calls. I wanted to be on stage to talk about what I was working on, and to set the record straight on what we had created. Instead my competitors got top billing and I was not allowed in. It felt corrupt to me, as if someone was trading favors behind the scenes. My hope is now SXSW, or whatever replaces it, will be more open-minded about who they include in the show. I'm still working and still have a story to tell.</description>

			<title>Nightly email switchover</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If all goes as planned, if you're subscribed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;, you should get two copies of the posts for April 27, one sent by the old software, and one sent by the new. The new version might look better in your mail reader app. That was the point of this transition. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBkVybd_vaWT4oen5uNAEKxK8ztFUvAStcCq0Y8m-0VSsTNQ/viewform?usp=header&quot;&gt;Google form&lt;/a&gt; where you can let me know how it went. Did it work? How many emails did you get? Does the v2 email look better than the old version? In general do you want to comment?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had to do a rewrite because when I originally wrote it, I misunderstood how CSS styling works in some/most email clients and it required a very deep rewrite of the software, it was actually harder to do the conversion than it was to write the software in the first place. And the app was running on an old version of PagePark and depended on Dropbox, and had broken in many ways over the years. But I never had the time to zero in on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now was the time to do it, because I want to do an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; email sender for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;. And in order for that to have even a small chance of working, I needed to do this transition, to get fully up to date on the best practices for HTML email in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yet another plug for ChatGPT. It's like having a library of medical journals for a general practitioner. I'm sure they have this, if a GP has a question about which specialist to send a patient to. And then they probably have good reference materials for the specialist too, to be sure they're using the latest proven techniques for treating disease. Believe it or not we have nothing like this in software development. Which means we don't interop, and don't use prior art and are constantly reinventing each others' work because there's no way to find out about it. No conferences, no journals, nothing but hearsay and O'Reilly books and I hear they aren't very good these days. Enter ChatGPT, and all of a sudden if you have a question it has the freaking answer. It's as if medicine went from the pre-internet days to now, in just a couple of years. Only more so because medicine was considered a discipline, where developing software never has been. Now at least us practitioners have the tools if not the respect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;signup page&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;subscribe.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;. It's the same software now running on my latest server software, and served via HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why is AWS breaking Node devs?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been getting warnings on all my Node.js code that uses AWS api's that come September they're all going to break. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm working on my mail list stuff this week, trying to get the HTML to work for a lot more people than it was working for, and it's a very depressing process, but I did the work, but I don't plan on looking at this again for another five years, if then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But lurking in the background is the threat by AWS, and I consider a threat, that if I don't rewrite my code in a non-insignificant way, before September, it's all going to just stop working. I took the time the other day to actually look at what's involved, and I see that they changed/broke their API to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;. Great. Another stupid exercise in fealty. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they're going to regret doing this, because I don't have the time to go so deep in the bowels of pretty much my entire codebase, and potentially break everything, and then have to debug it, when I have so many other things to do, and I'm getting older, and I just don't have the energy to devote to make-work for Amazon. The arrogance of it, and how diseconomic it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They never promised they &lt;i&gt;wouldn't&lt;/i&gt; break all their developers, but geez who would've thought they &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; to? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think they're actually going to be able to flip the switch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/s3/issues/1&quot;&gt;what other developers think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Amazon APIs are the worst, so over-complicated, you have to understand everything before you can do anything. But once they work, they keep working. That's the only reason people put up with it. I've switched almost everything but S3 and SES to Digital Ocean because their docs and example code are great and they seem about the same price as Amazon, but my time is all I have, and Amazon doesn't use it well and ultimately that's going to hurt their business, and it seems September is when the shit is going to hit the fan for many, definitely for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This is different from the breakage that came in the Twitter API when Musk took over. No one was paying anything for this. But I pay a lot for AWS, more every month, as my storage costs go up. I think someone in AWS in a position to make big decisions has no clear idea where the costs are for their customers or they wouldn't do this. Imagine a company of gas stations deciding to change the shape of all the nozzles on their gas pumps in September. &quot;We gave you plenty of times to adapt!&quot; they might say. Yes, but -- as long as we have to change why not change to your competitor's service? The strangeness of their APIs is their lockin. I don't think they have factored that into their plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm rebuilding my nightly email-sending code from the bottom up. Something I never properly understood is that most mail clients don't include your CSS files, so people were seeing the writing and images with no style. What an embarassment. As often is the case in 2025, I have ChatGPT to guide me through getting this right. The secret is inline styles. And there's no simple way to do the conversion, except element by element. Seems like an OS could do this for us somewhere along the line. Now I have to think about how to test it without trying to just switch it over, trying to avoid breaking everyone at once. But the nightly email might start looking a lot better for some real soon, and for others, only slight almost no noticeable differences.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT can level the playing field</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a company that I have an account with because they're the only ones who provide the service I need, so I have to stay with them. They have made my telephone unusable, they call me all the time from varying phone numbers, wanting me to do things, or with a &quot;courtesy reminder&quot; that I could spend more money with them. My number is a cell phone btw. On my user profile on their site, I unchecked &lt;i&gt;phone&lt;/i&gt; as a way for them to contact me, only leaving email checked. They appear to be ignoring this. My question is this -- how do I get their attention and get them to stop calling me. The constant interruptions are interfering with my life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was a ChatGPT prompt. It gave me lots of options, but two were outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, they knew their privacy account, and a form on their website for reporting privacy violations. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They suggested I use commands in my cell phone to block unknown numbers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hadn't thought of doing this until today. Usually the big companies have all the power. They can force you to call them back and wait on hold and then it's not clear they'll even understand or respect the request. ChatGPT also suggested the FTC (heh I doubt if it can do much with Trump as president) or the state Attorney General (we still have a government in NY). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So think about it next time you have trouble with a megamonolithic company that's bullying you. We may have a tool at our disposal that levels the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's the philosophy of the web. Instead they captured the web, amputated all its good features, and locked it in the trunk and then cut off its air supply. That was inevitable given the path they went down. Yes they changed the world, and in turn are creating a lot of misery.&quot; If anyone writes the history of tech in Silicon Valley in the early part of the 21st century, I hope they focus on the damage done, not just the money made. Don't glorify the fortune, it's our freedom that's paid for it. And the amazing thing people will discover if they look closely is that the open technology cost very little to develop, so you don't need the backing of VCs to create open systems, you just have to be right at the right time and have the ability, focus and ambition to create enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html&quot;&gt;base technology&lt;/a&gt; to bootstrap the idea.</description>

			<title>My programmer friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning from Oaxaca in Mexico. We are here with my sad and depressed programmer friend, back from his European tour of glee club train compartments, receptions and cheese races with Europeans named Gouda, happy and carefree while my programmer friend, pictured here, thinks about returning to the good old United Snakes of Americans. As he sits on the beach, admiring the sunrise over the Pacific Ocean, he considers taking a job at a local Burger King. He enjoys their hamburgers even if he is not enjoying life at the moment. His eyes are tearing up as he remembers the tragedy that befell him and others in the Great Gouda Race of Luxembourg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/23/myProgrammerFriend.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;On the beach, dreaming of hamburgers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The runner of life and freedom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Start with the dark imagery of the Ridley Scott commercial for Apple in 1984. A woman athlete is running toward a screen carrying a big hammer, getting ready to hurl it at a huge screen with Big Brother's head, lecturing a huge hall filled with lifeless people listening. He has dead eyes. The runner represents life and freedom.  The overall image is dreary and lifeless but she is a bright light of hope for the future. Inspire me with this image. I want to be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/23/wouldntItBeNice.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;He has dead eyes.

			<description>If you're a young person contemplating a career in tech, great! It's fun, and you can help people doing this. But please don't listen to the VCs and entrepreneurs who say it's all about changing the world. Instead think of it this way -- you're going to create tools for people who may change the world, in collaboration with lots of other people. No one person is that smart and experienced that they know what's best for the world. The stories you heard about great inventors probably aren't true. And the ones who actually changed the world, may not have changed it for the better. Look at what happened with Twitter as a cautionary tale. Imho it would have been better if the founders had made less money, and opened the door for lots of competition right from the start. That's the philosophy of the web. Instead they captured the web, amputated all its good features, and locked it in the trunk and then cut off its air supply. That was inevitable given the path they went down. Yes they changed the world, and in turn are creating a lot of misery. You don't want to do that, brilliant young tech person, right? Let's make the world better, one little evolutionary step at a time. More about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/21/141055.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Don't try to change the world</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley encourages entrepreneurs to think in terms of changing the world. I was one of them when I arrived there in 1979 at the age of 24, with world-changing software ready to go (or so I thought). A few years later, I shipped a way of writing that was only possible on a computer, and in a small way I suppose it did change the world. I kept innovating, but over time I came to realize that one person trying to change the world is usually futile, but what's even worse, you might actually manage to change the world, and that's going to be a disaster for you and the world. As Elon Musk is doing right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk is the perfect cautionary tale for &quot;be careful of what you wish for.&quot; No one person should change the world. We are a creation of evolution, and we also are creators of evolution, but evolution is the result of lots of infinitesmal events, not some great god-like creation that young people tend to dream of. That's what he's doing wrong, trying to force his vision on all of the rest of us. We'd be crazy to wish for what he wants, and we're not that crazy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty good idea of what he wants because like him, I think in terms of what you can do with networks of computers and people. And I understand their weakness, and also believe in the good intentions of 99.99% of the people, so even though our networks are not perfectly secure somehow we seem to get by. But Musk has gotten inside, and is doing what he wants, and the rest of us don't get a say, and he's of the 0.01% you absolutely &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to have the keys to the treasury or nukes of the United States in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of wise people over a few hundred years set up a system where we all get a say, and it's gotten us by pretty well. When one person takes control, that's disaster, because no one, not even Musk, is an immortal god. He's got huge blind spots. If you try to rewrite every bit of code too fast you end up with a broken system. He'll leave and we'll have to deal with what remains. And hopefully after we get over that, we'll figure out how to not let a future Musk get in there again. And that's going to involve a fair amount of pain for the billionaires. If you all want to start helping to solve the problem, now would be a good time to get involved, Mr and Ms Billionaire. Thanks for listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/09/03/201849.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a141000&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; -- there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clip.cafe/sleeper-1973/what-happened-everybody/&quot;&gt;great joke&lt;/a&gt; in the Woody Allen movie Sleeper. It was about Albert Shanker playing the role of Elon Musk, who wasn't born when the movie came out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But it was an O'Reilly exec, Dale Dougherty, who drove it. I suppose perhaps Tim was saying, effectively, that Dougherty never told him what he was doing. But the information of his involvement was available publicly. At the time, we had the web (obviously) and good search engines. And O'Reilly Associates was a journalistic organization -- he could have asked someone to research it for him. Also the tech guy who ran the project was an O'Reilly employee. Maybe Tim didn't know. But he sure took it out on me personally. A lot of doors were closed to me because of this clash. But I don't apologize for anything I said. It &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a company thing. If Tim wasn't aware of what his #2 guy was doing, sorry that's not on me. But everyone involved knew it was O'Reilly doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- if ChatGPT had existed at the time, he could have asked for an impartial opinion. I'm going to try it now. Here's the prompt I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In 1999 or 2000 (not sure of the exact date) there was a fork of RSS, turning it into a dialect of RDF, a format that was being promoted by the W3C. They called it RSS 1.0. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It never really took hold, never became widely used, because the earlier version of RSS, v0.91 was being adopted at a very high rate because it was being supported by all the blogging platforms of the day, and by major publishers, including Salon, Red Herring, Motley Fool and Wired. Later the NY Times would support RSS 2.0, which was an evolution of RSS 0.91, and then the entire news industry followed their lead, and RSS quickly became the most popular way to read news on the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the question. Was O'Reilly Associates involved in the RSS 1.0 fork? Tim O'Reilly, at the time, said it wasn't involved. But Dale Dougherty, the #2 exec at O'Reilly lead the effort, and the technical lead was an O'Reilly employee. Would it be fair to say that ORA was involved. Would the fork have happened without their involvement? Try to be as impartial as you can.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have asked ChatGPT to give me a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/680644ab-ee60-8012-b3b5-77ddc2300958&quot;&gt;shareable version&lt;/a&gt; of its answer -- but I find that often people say they can't read it. But you have the prompt so you can ask ChatGPT or any other AI app, for it's (hopefully) impartial response. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: I fed the same prompt into &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/share/e347df31-c906-4db1-bb16-909f9e15541f&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/bae87a853d69&quot;&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Another view of me via ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who look down their noses at ChatGPT and its cousins tend to say it's not art. Hardly the most interesting thing, but as I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/28/124753.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;, art lives mostly in the mind of the viewer, it's the effect it has on the viewer -- that imho is the art. BTW I can tell when people have actually used the product, and most of the critics haven't. Sorry but until you use it you won't know how obvious that is to someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been interested in using ChatGPT to mash images together. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/20/200843.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I asked for a rendering of my headshot through a self-portrait of my niece. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)&quot;&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; with music but with images. I say here's a photo of me, and here's a drawing someone else did. Can you render the image of me in that style? As I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/20/200843.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; with my niece's portrait of herself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've also been doing stories that started with an image of Mark Zuckerberg, calling him &quot;my programmer friend&quot; and taking him through all kinds of adventures, none of which could shake his depression. It was like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordle%20kitty&quot;&gt;Wordle Kitty&lt;/a&gt; from last year, only these only went out via Facebook. I wish I had them in an easily shareable format, but next time I may start a group for them, or something else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a cartoon of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Hegseth&quot;&gt;Pete Hegseth&lt;/a&gt;, the US Secretary of Defense drawn by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deadder.net/home&quot;&gt;Michael de Adder&lt;/a&gt;. I thought wow that's different. I wonder what ChatGPT would do if I asked it to render my headshot in the style of that drawing? While it was doing the work, I tried to imagine what it would do with it! Would I be wearing a military uniform? Would I salute the viewer? Would it change my expression? Here's the drawing, and below it, the rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/04/21/hegseth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Hegseth as drawn by de Adder.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2025/04/21/winer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;My headshot rendered in the style of the Hegseth drawing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I was glad to see that I could just click Next without answering any question, and they got worse, more invasive, esp considering who the president is, and who he brought with him, so I just closed the page and wrote this post. I would, if I had it to do over again, not answered any of their questions, or maybe stopped at the standard Census questions from years past.</description>

			<description>One reason I want to bring blogging and social media together is so I don't have to think about where I will post stuff. This is really important. I want my blog to be a complete record of everything I write publicly. The way our online writing world has been siloized, basically no one has that. We're going to try to fix that, and not with just my software, but by setting some new standards for interop, extensions to RSS, so that there's no exclusivity to making software for writers or publishers. That's what I mean when I say something is &quot;on the web.&quot; If your system is not 100% replaceable, today, they you are not on the web and should not claim it. If you're thinking about freedom, btw -- this should be part of your big picture. So many smart people don't want to know how our networks work, and that makes you a victim. And it's not that hard to understand, no matter what people have led you to believe.</description>

			<description>I keep coming back to this -- ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and isn't that what we want? To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.</description>

			<source:outline text="I keep coming back to this -- ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and isn't that what we want? To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this." created="Sat, 19 Apr 2025 15:48:48 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/04/19.html#a154848"/>
