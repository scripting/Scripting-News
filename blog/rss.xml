Staffed by the team that ran the Harris campaign social media center during the campaign. They were snarky, fun, irreverent, and never apologized for representing the people, and they did it well. This is a moment. I no longer have to beg for this. It exists. So the first step has already been taken, thank goodness!!! Now it's up to &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; to spread the news that there is a place to find the heartbeat of the Dems. I'm going to study it, RT it, and keep the flame lit the best I can.</description>

			<title>We had it all on the web, and we will again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When we flatten out the differences between the different social networks, we'll start with their RSS feeds, if it works, ultimately there will be no need for different social networks. And again, if it works, we'll bring back the features of the open web that Twitter left out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a much better approach to federation, delivers the benefits long before hashing out the diffs betw ATP and ActivityPub will take. And we really have the choice that Bluesky says they will deliver, and yes, it will also be billionaire-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is art?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/27/131121.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; four new ChatGPT-created drawings, created with the latest upgrade of ChatGPT's drawing functions which are better than previous versions. The usual controversy is rekindled on the networks. The concern as always is that it learned how from human artists, puts artists out of business, and human artists create art, machines can't, and since this is created by software, it isn't art. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This gives me a chance to write a piece I've been wanting to write for a while. The meaning of art imho comes from what it says to and about the person observing it, what it does to them, how it changes them, what they experience. For most people, most of the time, they don't have any idea who created the art beyond their name, nationality and when they lived. If you see enough of their work, you learn about the work, not the person. What you learn from art is always going to be about yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father once told me, in all seriousness, the cliche about an abstract work of art -- it isn't art, my father said. I said to him, Dad that you feel so strongly about it means to you it most definitely &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; art. I believe if he were more truthful about his response, he would say what's behind the feeling, he's experiencing dishonesty, stolen valor, the artist is a profiteer, the person who made it a &lt;i&gt;con&lt;/i&gt; artist not a real artist. Pretty similar to what people say in 2025 about art-making machines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Is software art?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe it is. When people say my software thinks like they do, what's really happening is the software has gotten out of their way, they've incorporated the way it works into the base of their spine, so they can remain in the world they're writing about, and forget that they're using a piece of software. They perceive that as the software thinking like they do, which is fine -- it's the goal. But it's quite possible they have a totally different experience that takes them out of their suspension of disbelief by not working the way they expect, the same way it did the last 100 times, or it failes to open a file, or whatever might cause them to leave their own world and have to deal with the one I, and generations of software developers, have created, which can (as I know) be excruciating, humiliating, and whatever else you may feel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A new ChatGPT drawing tool</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT's drawing function has gotten a huge upgrade. I've been doing tests for the last 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First I gave it a screen shot of WordLand and asked for a nice colorful poster for the product. Then I had it make a movie poster for Mutiny on the Bounty with different actors, and As Good as it Gets, and then a stunning rendering of an El Salvador news photo in the style of Edward Hopper. It refused to do an R Crumb rendering or Doonesbury, but it was OK with Hopper.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/wordlandPoster.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;WordLand poster by ChatGPT. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/mutinyOnTheBounty.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Belushi and Jeff Bridges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/asGoodPoster.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;As Good as it Gets starring Jackie Gleason and Melissa McCarthy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/noemInElSalvadorPrison.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;An Edward Hopper rendering of &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/27/noemActual.png&quot;&gt;Secretary Noem&lt;/a&gt; at the El Salvador prison.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Join a parade today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This morning‘s &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/26/join-a-parade-today/&quot;&gt;early morning missive&lt;/a&gt; from WordLand..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Talking with friends about What To Do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I actually have an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all try to lead a parade, with a big viral idea, if only everyone would follow me, it might just work. A lot of us have that feeling. My advice — it doesn’t work. Lose it. Instead, find a parade you can join, and add your energy, talent and experience to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have a tremendous oversupply of would-be parade leaders, we need to build momentum, and it doesn’t really matter what it is or who leads it. As long as it’s something the press can cover. A movement that begets more motion. A huge march in DC. Demonstrations at Tesla dealers. Blogging in a group. Helping an existing group route around an outage. Making a great list of causes others can join. Reading a blog and finding the thing the blogger is looking for. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There’s great satisfaction in joining a righteous cause that’s working, my bother, my sister.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This goes back to something observed in standards work. The standard is set by the person who goes second, not the one who goes first. The person who chooses to interop instead of blazing a new incompatible trail. We should celebrate people who support others as much as we do the one who goes first. You need both, and the thirds and fourth adopters to create a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At a time like now when there’s no room for error or individual ego, as Ben Franklin’s so wisely said during America’s revolution, we must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: One way facebook can cripple a nascent movement, by the algorithm not showing you parades you might like too much. Remember Zuck is trying to ingratiate himself to trump. I find I’m seeing posts of vital interest to me over 24 hours after they were posted, when 165 people have already liked it. Suspicious behavior. We need to own our own social net. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: This philosophy led me to build on WordPress as a foundation, instead of building my own, which I am fully capable of. It’s working much better this way, so far. Could the be a way toward our own social net? Possibly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Doc's approach to WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Watching Doc Searls use WordLand to post to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's using it the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4100j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; worked for blogging in the late 90s early 00s. Every day is a new page, which contained as many items as you liked. When you add a blank line that starts a new post. It's Markdown kind of a approach to structuring text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a point where you click the &lt;i&gt;Flip Home Page&lt;/i&gt; button. You can do that once a day. Each day is a fresh start. Each day gets its own archive page. The software can automate some of that, but it's trivial to do it by hand. A nice daily ritual. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The RSS feed we generated looked for two Returns in the text, that started a new &amp;lt;item&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Manila eventually adopted Blogger's approach, but I always liked this way because it said a blog post can be a very small thing. That was certainly the way I write. Some ideas don't require a lot of writing, so why should they take up so much space? I'm trying to make sure that as WordLand evolves, it treats little things and big things with equal respect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically Doc is doing manually what Manila did for you, but it's not a lot of work, he just clicks the + icon to create a new post, when he wants a fresh start. He has to choose a site from a popup, and then he's ready to write. The advantage is he has them all arrayed for him to make a change where ever he likes. I have that when I write in Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's not getting the benefit of the RSS treatment in Manila. Both WordPress and WordLand see that as one post, not N posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Below is a screen shot of Docs blog, and below it, in contrast is a page generated by Manila in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/26/docsBlogScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;A screen shot of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/25/there-they-go/&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; in the life of Doc's new blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/26/scriptingscreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/08/28.html&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; in the life of Scripting News in 2001.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the michegas. My advice -- please -- do your protesting, resisting, DEIing, organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself with love even if the world isn't. So in that spirit for those of us who love cats -- a &lt;a href=&quot;https://prisonjournalismproject.org/2024/10/23/cats-came-to-my-california-prison/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).</description>

We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/&quot;&gt;ISOJ conference in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves&quot;&gt;Rosental Alves&lt;/a&gt;,  that his audience wouldn't like me. He is gentle generous person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was something I wanted to see. But in the Q&amp;A period, it all came out. Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white man and in their minds I couldn't have failed. Do they really believe that? Swimming upstream isn't easy for anyone. The experience at that conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories, when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but a lot of them didn't come from billionaires and VCs. I don't study the creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative &lt;i&gt;people.&lt;/i&gt; I tried to write the truth, didn't always succeed and sometimes I had to retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to what I believe. The &quot;white men bad&quot; thing was an excuse for people to say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from &quot;the woke&quot; which is a term I despise, what's wrong with being awake, what's the alternative, being asleep? dead? -- these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing, really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain is hard to forget.</description>

I decided to go, because a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was something I wanted to see. But in the Q&amp;A period, it all came out. Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white man and in their minds I couldn't have failed. Do they really believe that? Swimming upstream isn't easy for anyone. The experience at that conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories, when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but a lot of them didn't come from billionaires and VCs. I don't study the creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative &lt;i&gt;people.&lt;/i&gt; I tried to write the truth, didn't always succeed and sometimes I had to retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to what I believe. The &quot;white men bad&quot; thing was an excuse for people to say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from &quot;the woke&quot; which is a term I despise, what's wrong with being awake, what's the alternative, being asleep? dead? -- these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing, really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain is hard to forget." created="Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:13:58 GMT" type="outline" image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/25.html#a111358"/>

			<description>I was just thinking about themes for WordPress, and thought to look up Manila themes, and found we have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.userland.com/newsItems/viewDepartment$New%20Radio%20Theme&quot;&gt;whole website&lt;/a&gt; that's still &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.userland.com/about&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; (thanks Jake!) where you can see the catalog of themes we had for Manila and Radio (thanks Bryan Bell!). I want something like this for WordPress themes that work beautifully with WordLand-authored blogs.</description>

			<description>I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy editor would. I hope we're heading there. And if they have this, put it behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an experienced copy editor to do imho.</description>

			<description>We're getting into WordPress in a new way, the need for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/64&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt; came from users. I didn't know they had this feature in WordPress. If you asked me if it did, I would have said yes, I'm sure it does, but where and what is it called? i could've gotten that too via chatgpt, but i would have had to think of it. that's where having sharp users makes a world of difference. When people thank me for my generosity, they don't get it. I want something out of it, your experience and your mind. It's one of my main raw materials.</description>

			<description>With all the good stuff happening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; I haven't found time to wind down feedland.com and feedland.org. The servers are still working, though not performing as I'd like them to, but it doesn't seem I'm going to get the time to do a graceful transition before my self-imposed March 31 deadline. So I'll come up with a new plan, and if you're using either of these services, enjoy! and keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/forewarned-is-forearmed&quot;&gt;backing up&lt;/a&gt; your subscription list.</description>

			<title>Paving cowpaths</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2020/04/10/cow.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;A funny thing. A few months back someone told me that I had been gone from the podcast world for too long for anyone to listen to me. I thought how weird, I didn't go anywhere at all, I stayed exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; I was, all the time. Virtually every day. If people cared to know what I think they could have found out pretty quickly because I am of course an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB&lt;/a&gt;. I talk about what I think all the time. (And besides, why do you care where you get ideas from, I don't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idea was about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcasting/index.opml#1733322866000&quot;&gt;feature for podcasting&lt;/a&gt; that would open up doors for influencers and ad hoc networks of podcasts, instead of a few dozen weak (imho) attempts to build synergy, I trust that invisible hand Darwinian ecosystem builds better networks, because they are real, not contrived. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Give the people the tools and see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Users and developers party together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the opposite of the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; approach to technology, instead it's &quot;paving the cowpaths,&quot; the process that has always fascinated me and been the method to my madness. Make the tools, give them to the people and sit back and hope something happens. When it doesn't try to show the way. And try out lots of these kinds of ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This method really works, and it isn't destructive, it's totally constructive. (Actually it does destroy what was there before, but in a merciful way, they get a chance to jump on the train, even if they rarely do, but NPR got on early with podcasting, and the NYT with RSS.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I did not invent &quot;paving cowpaths&quot; -- it's been around for a long time, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1905885-the-mythical-man-month-essays-on-software-engineering&quot;&gt;mythical man-month&lt;/a&gt; and the like. It's pretty much the same thing as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrapping&lt;/a&gt;, which I also advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're right. It is a small piece that can be hooked into lots of places, as is WordPress a big place that can host lots of apps many of which haven't been written yet. Products that look outward that can be hooked up in a million ways to everything, and leave the door open for those who follow. Such products are rare in our world. People always try to own their users by locking out competitors. I found a perfect spot for me to put some software, and I am having fun watching people use it, and coming up with new features that build on what we have. I think the writing tools market for WordPress will be huge, and I firmly believe that will turn into what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, which you could also think of as just the web. Ben thinks of it as the &quot;indie web,&quot; and that's fine. It's all just the web. Anyway, I should have put something here a long time ago, but I didn't look inside WordPress until a couple of years ago and I really liked what I found.</description>

People always try to own their users by locking out competitors. I found a perfect spot for me to put some software, and I am having fun watching people use it, and coming up with new features that build on what we have. I think the writing tools market for WordPress will be huge, and I firmly believe that will turn into what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, which you could also think of as just the web. Ben thinks of it as the &quot;indie web,&quot; and that's fine. It's all just the web. Anyway, I should have put something here a long time ago, but I didn't look inside WordPress until a couple of years ago and I really liked what I found." created="Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:46:04 GMT" type="outline" image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/03/21.html#a154604"/>

			<description>Mini-spoilers follow. I'm a Severance lover, it's definitely one of the best shows ever, and I feel even more so after the season 2 finale which I watched last night on AppleTV+. I think there are two types of Severance users. One whose focus is on the evil and the other whose focus is on the love. If you think nothing happened in the finale then you're the first type, if you are the second type, this episode was incredible rich. And we learned what the goats were about and that's not nothing.</description>

I discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right.

This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to ingest everything it can find. Worried about hallucinations. But with a product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests are not problems with WordLand itself. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/62&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where you can report on your experience. Remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/commentGuidelines/&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks!</description>

			<description>I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeffcnichols.net/2025/03/20/the-writers-web-aka-blogging/&quot;&gt;Jeff Nichols' piece&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't agree that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;the writer's web&lt;/a&gt; is blogging. I think it's bigger. Blogging is &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the writer's web. Today's writing network is much more powerful, the software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn't exist last time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better because it's of the web, with &lt;i&gt;no limits. &lt;/i&gt;We've got the beginning of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing and reading environments, and we don't need federation because the web takes care of that.</description>

So Twitter made subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky, etc mostly can't get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking about it and while they do, we're losing everything that's important to us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can't all be masters of our own silo'd domain. We need a web for words that's simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn't lose the essential features writers need. I don't know what we need to win, but I do know what we need to get started.</description>

			<title>Using ChatGPT for tech support</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong. It has infinite time to help, and won’t mind if the problem turned out to be a random browser plug-in that was misbehaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It often suggests trying things you might not have thought of.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use it myself esp as often is the case there’s no one who can or is willing to work for me for free. I’m already playing it $20 per month, and for that I get as much time as it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Really good for organizing your approach to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A piece that Paul Krugman should write. How what Musk is doing to the US is worse than the 2009 near-collapse of the world economy. People who think he's going to bring down just the US, should recall how close we all came to falling into the abyss. But this time there will be no one to save us.</description>

			<description>The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things that don't belong to them. There's no policing. The richest people are the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people's creations. That's the common theme. Now they're in DC, going for all of it. The whole thing. But they're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0&quot;&gt;dog that catches the car&lt;/a&gt;. They don't have the slightest idea what to do with what they're taking. How could they? It's incomprehensibly vast.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415&quot;&gt;data behind&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/16/blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh/&quot;&gt;WordLand blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few days ago. I'm publishing these so people get an idea of the structures we're working with. It's basically a WordPress post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS, Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out, there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2, Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol, Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol designer, don't try to plan for things you don't have a working model of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together will work much better. And only add things you're willing to live with forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the format we work with inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, and more important, in the new APIs, that build on and simplify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpcom&quot;&gt;excellent API&lt;/a&gt; that Automattic had already produced.</description>

			<title>John Palfrey on the moment</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn't happened yet. A lot of people weren't yet aware. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt;, who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I'm going to publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the places I'm hooked into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out loud in public: &quot;we believe in the rule of law in America&quot;? That seems not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this topic is what is striking me most at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing, to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with impunity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves just one. This is not &quot;fancy law stuff&quot;. This is &quot;4th grade civics stuff&quot; -- separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we don't teach civics enough in America...).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It is actually *not* more complicated than that. It can't be that hard to say out loud: &quot;we value the rule of law in America&quot; -- no matter your politics or party.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Get back on the air</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Dems highest priority should be to get the Kamala Harris campaign back on social media, 24 by 7, with the truth and snark, irreverance, disrespectful of the Repubs, as a matter of principle. They were great. Perfect. We need a voice for the Democrats on the social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would someone please send this to AOC, Jasmine Crockett, Bernie Sanders, Mark Cuban, James Carville, anyone else you can think of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems only problem is there is no voice, no pulse, no heartbeat. Even without this, they almost won the last election. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything you like about government came from the Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We miss you. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22on%20the%20air%22&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; on the air! No time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Poking around on old servers I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsonify.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;this cute little app&lt;/a&gt; that jsonifies an RSS feed. Not sure why I did it. Postscript, it only works for one feed, mine. I replaced it with a template in the feeder app which was a useful version of the cute little app. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/?template=jsonify&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjeffmilner.com%2F%3Ffeed%3Drss2&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; of it viewing the contents of a feed in JSON using a special template.</description>

These are the same categories you can edit in the WordPress user interface. But I learned that you need to be able to add categories when you're writing. You want this functionality to be close-by. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/16/twoColumnScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Two columns&lt;/a&gt; in the Categories dialog.

			<title>Blogging is due for a refresh</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Websockets have replaced long polling. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SQL is fast and the tools are much better.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from  twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to get a list of old school bloggers who are still at it. How would you go about that? I decided to give it to Gemini, limiting it at first to 100 bloggers. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/finding-old-school-bloggers-who-are-still-at-it/&quot;&gt;prompt&lt;/a&gt; I wrote. For a while I was wondering what &quot;deep research&quot; was for, but as it's starting the work, I'm thinking of resources that would fit in -- like blogtree.com -- a fascinating site, gives a clear picture how blogs emerge out of the community of an earlier blog. Anyway it's working on it while I write this post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An application ChatGPT is great it. You're staring at some code, it's really straightforward, you've done this a thousand times, but it doesn't work. Stare at it some more. Try re-entering it. Change the names of things. Still doesn't work. Copy and paste the problem code into ChatGPT and in an instant it tells you without you even having to ask that your comment isn't properly terminated, so the runtime was never seeing the code, and nothing I did made the slightest difference. The information was there. I had been staring at it, but humans see what we expect to see. Machines don't have that problem, at least not in this way (thinking of hallucinations).</description>
