It sounds like the problems were introduced when I did a rewrite of the tab code, and it's probably due to some code catching the click before it gets to the tab code. Once found, it's easy to fix. If you're running Brave or using an Android tablet, could you give it a try per Rich's description, see if you can reproduce. Also curious if there are error messages in the JavaScript console. Thanks!</description>

			<title>Random WordPress idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caveat: This very likely already exists. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Random idea for my friends at Automattic. How about a theme for a WordPress site that's good for technical subjects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should have good default styles for code. Handle screen shot images gracefully. Basically a way of using WordPress for documenting the kinds of things we write up on GitHub because their editor is designed to work well for technical stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking out loud. A good test case would be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't look too great after years of no-updates (more than 20 years) and browser slippage? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It started life as a Manila site, transitioned to WordPress, and now I believe it's a static site. At one time it looked good in WordPress. It could totally use the kind of treatment &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt; got, but obviously it's serving a different purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am going to ask for a discussion about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page for RSS&lt;/a&gt;, because I think it misses the significance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, how it became a big thing. It had little to do with the quality of the technical work, there wasn't much of that, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798834000&quot;&gt;quality varied&lt;/a&gt; as has been pointed out many times. What made it happen was a vision by some exec at Netscape (whose name is never in the writeups, probably because it isn't on the Wikipedia page), a pitch, and a leap of faith by publishers: Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. And if they hadn't, there wouldn't have been anything worth fighting for. I never would have gotten involved, and blogging might not have been part of RSS, as it was. Then, a few years later, the NYT. And then everyone. It's an interesting story, imho -- and it would be good to make the story available to future would-be innovators. Don't design a perfect format and expect the world to beat a path to your door, it doesn't work that way. You have to keep coming back to the problem, try a new approach, gain some traction, and hope you're not going down a blind alley. The actual story of how it happened belongs on that page.</description>

			<description>I know Elon Musk isn't popular, but I saw an older interview of his where he said something important that most people don't realize about technology. Sometimes we lose abilities we had in the past. His example was space travel. In the sixties we went to the moon. A decade later we could only put people in earth orbit. A few decades after that, not so much. I've seen this in software and networks. In some ways they have become far more powerful, in terms of bandwidth, CPU speed and the cost of storage. But software-wise, the runtime that we develop for today is a shadow of what it was in the 80s. We gave up a lot in going to the web, and made some terrible decisions, collectively, about languages and styling. JavaScript is horrendous for building complex systems, the worst language imaginable, but we use it as the default. And CSS, it's disgusting how hard it is to control, at things it claims to be good at. If only we were using C or Pascal, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;. When you study how these systems evolved, the discontinuities and how they were usually the result of a company trying to own something they could have let everyone build on (the Mac UI for example, and the networking built into every Mac). I've made some of these mistakes myself, so I'm not saying it's about quality of individuals. It's just that we don't think enough about what we're doing, and before you know it some things are tossed aside that were really good, and replaced them with systems that are grossly inadequate.</description>

This tab, the one I'm writing into now, is for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I have one for my development work, general notes, not project-specific. And tabs for all the projects I've been working on in the last few days or in some cases weeks or months. From a writing standpoint, it doesn't matter whether they're on different sites, the idea of a site is not even in the user interface of my editor. In WordPress it's everything. The usual caveat: unless I'm missing something. I imagine people use browser tabs to work on more than one document at a time? I keep thinking there's a lot of stuff we can do to make WordPress work better for writers, I'm trying to be nice about this, but it doesn't work at all for me as a writer. I want it to work. I still can't believe there aren't a dozen different approaches to writing in WordPress. Seems like a fair amount of innovation is possible. I'm a writer who also is a developer. This has been bugging me for the last year or so. Why do I think WordPress is so important? 1. Obviously it has a huge installed base. If there's an opportunity to create something that even a small number of them would like, it's worth doing. 2. WordPress is the only product out there that supports &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. So If I want lots of outlets for basic text writing, you have to start somewhere. Luckily there's WordPress, sitting there, ready to be recast as a social media app. If you know me, you know I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; puzzles like this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="I always have multiple tabs open in my outliner. This tab, the one I'm writing into now, is for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I have one for my development work, general notes, not project-specific. And tabs for all the projects I've been working on in the last few days or in some cases weeks or months. From a writing standpoint, it doesn't matter whether they're on different sites, the idea of a site is not even in the user interface of my editor. In WordPress it's everything. The usual caveat: unless I'm missing something. I imagine people use browser tabs to work on more than one document at a time? I keep thinking there's a lot of stuff we can do to make WordPress work better for writers, I'm trying to be nice about this, but it doesn't work at all for me as a writer. I want it to work. I still can't believe there aren't a dozen different approaches to writing in WordPress. Seems like a fair amount of innovation is possible. I'm a writer who also is a developer. This has been bugging me for the last year or so. Why do I think WordPress is so important? 1. Obviously it has a huge installed base. If there's an opportunity to create something that even a small number of them would like, it's worth doing. 2. WordPress is the only product out there that supports &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. So If I want lots of outlets for basic text writing, you have to start somewhere. Luckily there's WordPress, sitting there, ready to be recast as a social media app. If you know me, you know I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; puzzles like this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 04 Jan 2024 21:22:51 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/01/04.html#a212251"/>

Only five players on the court at once, they play both offense and defense, and they aren't wearing armor like football players, you see their faces, whether they're cool or hot, emotional or stoic, up or down. So when your team trades two of its best-known players for three players you've never heard of, to a team that's rebuilding, first you feel sad, and then you wonder what the new teams will be like. One of the traded players, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;Immanuel Quickley&lt;/a&gt;, is a young, happy warrior with a deadly offense, but he was a Knicks bench player because they already had an All-Star quality player at his position, point guard, the quarterback of a basketball team. He led the second unit, and probably had a lot to do with the Knicks' success last year. I watched the Raptors game last night, and while the joy seemed to be gone from his demeanor, he was their starting point guard, and now he gets a chance to prove himself. The Knicks got something they needed, desperately, now that their defensive leader, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson&quot;&gt;Mitchell Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, is injured and out for the season -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby&quot;&gt;OG Anunoby&lt;/a&gt; -- who fit in so well into the starting lineup, in place of the other player the Knicks traded, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett&quot;&gt;RJ Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, who never became the producer we hoped he would. The new Knicks starting five are a much better team than they were before the trade, or so it seems after one game. I admit, I had gotten bored with Knicks this season, but yesterday's game was interesting and exciting, and even better &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/knicks/news/new-york-knicks-2024-game-recap-minnesota-timerwolves-julius-randle-og-anunoby&quot;&gt;the Knicks won&lt;/a&gt;, against one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves&quot;&gt;best teams&lt;/a&gt; in the NBA.

			<description>BTW, I wrote a wizzy writing tool for WordPress. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/01/blogbrowserscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted something simpler for posting to feedland.blog. I think it could work even more smoothly, it was a first effort. One thing I don't understand is why aren't there a dozen such writing tools for WordPress. It has a great API, really easy to work with. It's a very versatile product, yet people seem to stick with the built-in writing interface. Curious.</description>
