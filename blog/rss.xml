I think I understand the game much better now. I do sometimes make mistakes, and always pay for them. The thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling when you press Return to see the result of your first guess. It's like opening a present, only better. If you get two green tiles, you can bask in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I've never gotten it in two, and I don't usually try, and when I do it's usually a mistake, I would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love, self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five green tiles open up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg&quot;&gt;one at a time&lt;/a&gt;. That's the feeling that keeps me coming back day after day.</description>

			<title>Whatever verse you like</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.masto.land/@dave/111517322418415422&quot;&gt;Mastodon post&lt;/a&gt; to a bunch of people who somehow I got cc'd to. I figured I should share it here too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let's start with feeds and build as much of a Mastodon as we can, without inventing anything new and see what we come up with.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That way we know at every step we're standing on a solid foundation of interop.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the same time invest in the feed support of every contender, no matter what &quot;verse&quot; its part of. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;John Spurlock has done an exemplary implementation of RSS 2.0 feeds for Bluesky. That &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; should be copied everywhere. He did it in about a week in July and it's great. We're building all kinds of stuff on it. Wish it were in Mastodon, and wish Bluesky would bake it in.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Forget about clubs, what we want is interop, maximally as widely as possible to force the silos to get on board. They won't unless they have to.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about the Fediverse?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fediverse&quot; is another kind of silo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our social media apps should be rising up out of feeds to interop with each other now, not sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By then Facebook (or Meta or Threads) will own us as much as Twitter did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Doc &amp; FeedLand &amp; artcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I pinged Doc the other day saying he should do an artcasting feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doc is in addition to being a prodigious blogger, also is a photo taker and story teller, so he is perfect for artcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/07/29/doc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was then going to think about what would be the easiest way to get him going, and quickly realized the fastest way is Bluesky because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock&quot;&gt;John Spurlock&lt;/a&gt; did it right and his feeds coming out of Bluesky are totally artcasting-compatible. Just like that. (Artcasting is one of those cases where almost everyone was doing it the right way. Absolutely no one invented it, it was just obvious how it should work, obvious to enough people.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to talk about it with A8C people first, because it's also an opportunity to support it in WordPress, or to create a small app that interfaces to WordPress, so it can lead here too. But Doc beat me to it, he posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social/post/3kfnwb6dbf72b&quot;&gt;beautiful picture&lt;/a&gt; of a building site his new hometown to Bluesky, and it appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:dsearls.bsky.social&quot;&gt;his RSS 2.0 feed&lt;/a&gt;, and of course it &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?item=594431&quot;&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social&quot;&gt;in FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; when I subscribed to his feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I added it to my collection of artcasting feeds, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.feedcorps.org/artshow.opml&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?readinglist=https%3A%2F%2Flists.feedcorps.org%2Fartshow.opml&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedcorps=true&quot;&gt;FeedCorps&lt;/a&gt; and his name shows up in the list in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://artshow2.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;artshow app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is how we do it, keep turning the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interop my friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In the hands of someone who knows how to squeeze money from the US government, as Musk surely does (and Trump had no idea) -- it could be worth many more billions than he paid for Twitter.</description>

In the hands of someone who knows how to squeeze money from the US government, as Musk surely does (and Trump had no idea) -- it could be worth many more billions than he paid for Twitter." created="Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:50:38 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2023/12/02/whatIsElonMuskDoing.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="3080321" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/whiteRabbitFromAliceInWonderland.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/02.html#a165038"/>

			<description>You can live in places where people do awful disgusting things, I know, I've lived in New Orleans, Berkeley and NYC. Twitter is so huge, this idea that it could disband just like that, well it isn't happening. Maybe it's time for us to say clearly what we expect of a social network and try to influence how they run them. We have these great tools for organizing, one of these days we're going to use them for good, in a serious way. And at this point the users have a lot of power relative to what we've had in the past.</description>

			<description>I'm cleaning up some loose-ends in the Scripting News redesign, esp in the phone version. After that, I'm going to start applying the same techniques to FeedLand on phones. Our timelines look fine in that context, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/scriptingMobileScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>If I could devote myself fulltime to AI development, first thing I'd do is teach a bot how to generate CSS with high level commands from me. After 15 years of wrangling CSS, I still create messes that are impossible to unravel, the only way to fix it is to start over, and then that gets out of control, and on and on. It would take some patience to establish some basic design patterns, but once designed I could say things like &quot;a little less margin on top of the tabs&quot; and boom that would happen.</description>

			<description>Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/786af3a9-c35c-499f-8e97-f4b7017415ab&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;? It fell off the air when Twitter blew up their API. I keep wanting it back, because I keep watching shows that should be in its database. I miss it. Then I realized it's not that different from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot;&gt;group of explorers&lt;/a&gt; who are putting their app choices into feeds. The Bingeworthy database is people, shows and ratings. The simplest relational database possible. It would be easy to represent each user as a feed, where each item is a rating. The link for each item would be a pointer to the Metacritic page. And then give each feed a category of &lt;i&gt;bingeworthy. &lt;/i&gt;From there, we explore.  BTW, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/a5b3ac43939954c4af6759a9ce27989f&quot;&gt;SQL code&lt;/a&gt; that creates the BW database.</description>
