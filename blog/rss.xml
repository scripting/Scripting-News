			<title>Trump and Trudeau chat</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/191367/trump-treasury-default-bond-market&quot;&gt;New Republic&lt;/a&gt; is beginning to think like Musk and Trump. But they have to think a bit more and ask how does this all tie together? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember you have to consider events that would normally be unthinkable. And believe that Trump isn't actually president of the United States in any sense of what that meant in the past. He is sitting in the seat of the president. He has the powers of the president, but he does not represent the interests of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's going to use the US Treasury and the power of the dollar as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#:~:text=A%20reserve%20currency%20is%20a,of%20their%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves.&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt;, to buy himself a few toys to play with, like Canada, Greenland, Gaza and Panama, to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, here's the text of an imaginary conversation between Trump and Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: Hey Justin, how's it going?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: You know, not so good.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: I get it. Have you considered my offer?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: Yes. Either we surrender and become the 51st state, or you won't honor Canadian deposits in the US Treasury. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: That's right my friend.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: I don't see how we have any choice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: I'm afraid that's correct. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: Semi-sarcastic: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and Canada. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: You can leave out the Canada part. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trudeau: You can't blame me for trying.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump: Have a nice day. 😀&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nYgfV2oJA&amp;t=130s&quot;&gt;scene from Goodfellas&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates what's next for the former independent country of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's past time to wake up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At some point soon we’re going to have to stop business as usual. Remember when we realized Covid was deadly and we’d have to radically change our lives to survive? Most of us did that. We’re going to do that soon re the overthrow of our government and looting of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude everything is normal. It’s not. We’re going to have to start shutting down all the services we can to make the point to our fellow citizens that we, the United States, are not coming back from this without major change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Musk roots the world economy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, that's just a theory, but I need to get your attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can do anything, install or uninstall anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mostly journalism has been reporting &quot;He has our social security numbers.&quot; Sigh. That's not nearly the problem folks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete debt. Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows those guys. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don't believe me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It's clever because it doesn't require soldiers, not one shot will be fired. My guess is that they already have this power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, here's SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table named inventory. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;delete from inventory where rand () &lt; 0.2;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the greatest depression ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21&quot;&gt;ask ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world economy. It's where people store their money.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz's&lt;/a&gt; statue unveiled in San Francisco &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue.

If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz's&lt;/a&gt; statue unveiled in San Francisco &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072&quot;&gt;random snarky slogan&lt;/a&gt; my test script picked out was really &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;appropriate&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; because of their famous coverage of the Musk Coup, so I also added its feed to my blogroll so I could &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/blogrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;see what I bought&lt;/a&gt;, and was actually not surprised that they've been hit by the same disease all online publishing has, the need to bait the clicks, and of course not very much of it is hard-hitting.</description>

			<description>The AI world would have done much better with a president like Biden than we will with Trump. AI is a very potent tool for surveillance. Completely changes the game. And if it were just Trump and not Musk we'd have a chance, but Musk and Thiel fully understand the power, and probably already have all the code written, they just need the database records to scan and now they have all of them. Eventually we'll be talking about the &quot;peaceful uses of AI&quot; as we do about nuclear tech. But just saying that will get you punished.</description>

Eventually we'll be talking about the &quot;peaceful uses of AI&quot; as we do about nuclear tech.

It was used to shame a Democrat who was doing a great job of explaining the danger, Sen Murphy of Connecticut. I switched to basketball in disgust, thinking these people, CNN, they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&quot;&gt;not serious people&lt;/a&gt;. This problem isn't on the Dems, it's on all of us, and it always was. To pin it on the Dems is to say it's hopeless because right now they're just our representatives in Congress and some of our state governments. We have a big problem and we probably can't dig out of it, but if we have any hope at all, orgs like CNN have to stop being such idiots. Every so often I see a spark of brilliance over there, and then one of these things happens. What's more depressing, Trump or CNN? CNN by a lot. And the NYT and all the rest of the broken media. We are all in the same boat.</description>

			<description>In January I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/myAppList/&quot;&gt;an online diary&lt;/a&gt; where I list each of the apps I manage, as I work on them. When I work on one, I move it to the top. The notes are brief and to anyone but me might seem cryptic. But at least you can follow what I'm doing. No I don't plan to do an RSS feed for it. It's just a place to keep track of all the things I work on, for people who I work with, and most important, me.</description>

Make readers think of what life will be like without them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have done this a long time ago, when Reagan said, arrogantly, the government is the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That should have been rebutted, strongly and regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to learn what they actually do, all of them, at least understand what we're going to live without.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to try it out. &quot;I want to tell a story about a typical person who works for the US government. It shouldn't be a glamorous job, but an important one. It should improve people's lives, health, happiness, fulfillment. Pick the role at random, as well as gender, age, race, geography. Write a 100 word job description, and  provide a realistic looking profile picture. Nothing about their personal life, or actual name, but it's okay to talk about the required education and experience for the job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what it came back with: &quot;An Environmental Health Officer (EHO) plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health by identifying and mitigating environmental hazards.

If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he's doing to our system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk's chaos becomes more and more real.</description>

If not now, keep this in mind as Musk's chaos becomes more and more real." created="Wed, 05 Feb 2025 15:35:10 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/16/blackLivesMatter.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/05.html#a153510"/>

			<description>I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/devs.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;Developers account&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky to follow Tim Bray, Simon Willison, Techdirt, Manton Reece and Cory Doctorow. I took my feeds off the list, and added other developer accounts I regularly read. I'm trying to bootstrap something here, to see what can be done, and feel it's important to take myself out of the list for now.</description>

Sanewashing was just the tip of the iceberg, you can't blame it on the press, we didn't demand they get their shit together, we didn't try to change the subject so they'd have to tell the real story. We had a lot of tools available to us that we didn't use because we are lazy and selfish. BTW, if you want to follow the power, don't look at what governments do, look at what the other oligarchs do.

			<description>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22&quot;&gt;Suggested User List&lt;/a&gt; that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course &lt;i&gt;publicly owned&lt;/i&gt; now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.</description>

We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time, when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start trying to get their attention, which hasn't happened yet, it's going to be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis isn't good. But we should get our shit together asap because it's our only hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless.

			<description>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.</description>

			<description>A bit of advice for Dems in Congress. Go home and have town halls, and listen. And stop listening to the consultants and each other.

			<description>I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.</description>
