And as long as I can get a good selection of interesting stuff to listen to on my phone, there's no reason look elsewhere.

A few nasty people in the early 00s did a number on RSS and started putting that awful word next to RSS. It was a way of earning points from the people who ran Twitter and tech conferences like SXSW, basically asshole-like people who wanted to close the door on the open web. And now here we are 2.5 decades later and people are &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; doing it. You should self-censor on that one, those people are long-gone, probably doing stuff with crypto or nuzzling up to oligarchs, and you're keeping their asshole-ness alive. That's pretty fucked up.</description>

			<description>I wanted to design a Google Form, and thought to ask ChatGPT for instructions from a spec I wrote. Then I thought to ask Gemini, which is Google's chatbot, wondering if they would just do the work for me instead of providing instructions. I would have laughed out loud if they did, but alas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/add0560b6b02&quot;&gt;just instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually they will do that for you.</description>

			<title>About the Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanson has been working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/&quot;&gt;Baseline theme&lt;/a&gt; and it's ready for people to try out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme for WordLand-authored WordPress sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site running in WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the features you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Scott has said he'd be happy to work with others to make it so that it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As the developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way blogs implement various features in 2025. It's been a long time since we took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used, especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging predates both. So of course the &lt;i&gt;presentation&lt;/i&gt; of the blog has opportunities to evolve as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bottom-line -- if you already have a WordPress theme you're happy with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you're starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I have it installed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse.org&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm a happy camper. So we have one endorsement. It's a good start. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have comments or questions, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/88&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; to post them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me think I must be dreaming. &lt;i&gt;NYK leads 3-1.&lt;/i&gt; Yesterday at this time (5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and the beginning of last night's game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks couldn't seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It's primitive, but it's real. However! In the second half it turned around. The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by &lt;i&gt;being better&lt;/i&gt; than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must've relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we're up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one, it's over. No I didn't think we'd be here tonight. Remember that when you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as unbelievable as that might be.</description>

Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful.

That happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid.

			<description>So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.</description>

			<title>What do I really own?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree &quot;I own you.&quot; The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. &quot;I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die.&quot; I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership. But it sure did put things in perspective!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/11/ownership.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;I thought of the tree, &quot;I own you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote that paragraph in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html#p9324&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Someday I'll be able to point ChatGPT at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; for writing about WordLand, and tell it to read every page that's linked to it, and from that put together a well-organized book about WordLand.

			<title>Software isn't a thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When a friend discovers a new product of mine and says the world owes Dave for being such a great guy, I wish they'd skip that part, and follow what we're doing. Get in the loop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Software isn't a thing, it isn't finished, it's a process as it gets invented by the users. It's a performing art. WordLand today is like a musician performing in a small club, working out the playlist, and hoping to be playing at theaters then arenas, and finally someday, if we're very good, stadiums. But we need help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you love WordLand, subscribe. Use the software. Learn what it can do, hit its limits, make requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember very well being handed a list of feature requests by Apple's lead evangelist from a new exec they just hired at Apple. I looked at the list, and handed it back and said I'd like to meet him. On the paper was the top ten list of &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; MORE user at the time. We knew what they wanted because we listened, studied, and learned. I knew his new boss was a real user, and thus I knew we could do stuff together. It worked out exactly that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you love it, use it, &lt;i&gt;become part of it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've written about this over the years with the motto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+shitty+software&quot;&gt;we make shitty software&lt;/a&gt;. If you use it and share what you learn, it will get better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>America as a platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We lived for the first years of my life in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights&quot;&gt;Jackson Heights&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably, today, the most culturally diverse place in the world. In the 1960s it was a white neighborhood that was adjacent to a black neighborhood, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;. They paired our elementary schools when I was in third or fourth grade. My little brother went to the school in Corona, and I stayed in the school in Jackson Heights. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/05/10/eveWinerPeterWinerWalkToSchool.png&quot;&gt;famous picture&lt;/a&gt;, in our family at least, of my mother walking my brother to school. It was on the front page of the NYT one day. That was a big deal then.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was in fifth grade we moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;. It was a sleepy little place (for NYC), nice houses, mostly Irish and Italian families with a few Jews. Now it's a Far East culture, from China and Korea, and still just as nice as it ever was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have a system in this country, it takes people from everywhere and gives them a platform to create whatever they want. In Flushing it's the best Chinese food in the city, which is saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think the shape of the intellectual world will be vastly different after AI, and that its impact will overshadow the web as the web made card catalogs irrelevant.

			<title>My programmer friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been writing the colorful saga of my sad depressed programmer friend on Facebook, and it was getting some interest from friends until I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1610208569758308&quot;&gt;moved it into a group&lt;/a&gt; and now no one reads it, which makes me sad and depressed too because the story of my programmer friend took an interesting turn after he maxed out on space, got a call from the NBA commisioner asking if he would mind officiating the Knicks two playoff games in Boston this last week. My friend, was of course quite sad and depressed, but he was also exhausted and bored, so he said yes. Here he is before the first of two games, which partially thanks to his officiating were near-blowouts for the Celtics, and thus the Knicks are up 2-0 heading into tomorrow's game in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/sadFriendInBostonKnicksWinHaha.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Friend sadly officiating at the TD Garden in Boston.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Here he is before the first of two games, which partially thanks to his officiating were near-blowouts for the Celtics, and thus the Knicks are up 2-0 heading into tomorrow's game in New York." created="Fri, 09 May 2025 20:25:01 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/05/09/202442.html#a202501"/>

			<title>The latest Baseline theme</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say the latest &lt;i&gt;Baseline&lt;/i&gt; theme looks great!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I just wrote, in the WordLand editor, and the writing experience was excellent. It took a long time and a lot of work to get it there, but it is there now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as the post says, it's not just a blog post, it's also a tweet. And it's not a miracle, it's just endless iteration over both sides, the reading and writing, until it felt right. So far all that's visible is the writing side. But I know something about reading too, having written a number of feed readers over the years, including the first one. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Scott Hanson on one side of this effort and me on the other, him the developer, me the user (ie writer of blog posts and tweets) -- we wrestled with WordPress themes. I wanted a minimal design, a place to start -- which is why the theme is called Baseline. It's a Christmas Tree without any ornaments. None. A fresh start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be a release of this theme in a short while. I just wanted to boast a bit about what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/baselineExample.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the post rendered in Baseline theme.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/05/09/an-invitation-from-wordland/&quot;&gt;viewed in the web&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/09/wordlandEditor.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the post being edited in WordLand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Also, I applied the new Baseline theme to my daveverse site, the one I use to test stuff in WordLand, and occasionally write something with a bit of lasting value. As a result it got a new domain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/&quot;&gt;daveverse.org&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to offer the &lt;i&gt;Baseline&lt;/i&gt; theme for others to use after a bit more testing and refining. But it's getting close. It seems like it's the last big thing on the agenda, but something else will probably pop up. Praise Murphy.</description>

It feels like 2015, when the Mets would be down 9-0 in the seventh, and you'd tune in to see how they would win. At the very end of the Knicks game tonight, when the Celtics were up by 1, I thought how would this feel if the Knicks came back so far and didn't win. I should've known better. All those insufferable years when we wore &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/27/knicksFansWithBagsOverHeads.png&quot;&gt;paper bags to hide our faces&lt;/a&gt;, even if this is as far as the Knicks get this year, it will have been worth it. Sports teaches you to believe, if you wait long enough your team teaches you that. I've learned it from the Mets so many times, and the Knicks now. I just wish &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier&quot;&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt; were doing the color with Mike Breen doing the play by play. But who cares, this was great sports. Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt&quot;&gt;Monica McNutt&lt;/a&gt; on MSG in a daze. It's like homecoming. I might just splurge for a ticket to Saturday night's game. It's a pretty easy drive.</description>

			<title>Notes for WordLand users</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Three questions came up in overnight posts re &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Where did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/83&quot;&gt;Bookmarks menu&lt;/a&gt; go? It's mentioned in the docs under &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/#1732286073000&quot;&gt;Feature List&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature doesn't appear to be in the product. It is there, you just have to go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/06/settings.png&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/a&gt; page to turn it on. It's in the menu at the right edge of the screen. I'm doing some work on it, simplifying it, and finding and fixing a bug. It's going to be in the final 1.0 release of WordLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How do I know when an post has been published? It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/57#issuecomment-2853465283&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; we post a dialog that confirms that a post is published. People found it confusing since it appears as if it works like a social media post editor, as in Twitter or Mastodon, it behaves like a blog post editor. This is a good and valid point and something that had not occurred to me! I've been advertising it as inspired by the tiny little textbox editors, but it doesn't behave like one, because you can edit a post after it has been published and it is expected that the user knows this, and they don't always get it. I will work on this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The user might not have a WordPress site. They may have created an account to just log onto WordLand, but didn't know they needed to also create a site to work with. The software does not behave well in this circumstance. Again, something that did not occur to me, because I think of the WordPress world as huge, and that my new, tiny and humble product couldn't be creating new users for them, but it does. So there will have to at least be docs for how to do this. Not sure if there's an API for creating a new site, I imagine that there is not such a thing, but will look into it.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

Learned my lesson on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/82&quot;&gt;0.5.7 release&lt;/a&gt;. There comes a point in a developing product that it may not be perfect for every possible user, and while it has bugs (all software does), it is useful for what it was designed to do. In the case of WordLand, there's nothing else like it out there, and it forms a foundation to build on, not just for itself but for other types of editors, all pumping people's writing out through WordPress. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt; with a sweet new UI. Thousands of developers work in WordPress. Maybe tens of thousands. That's what I get excited about. WordLand is the equivalent of the twitter-like &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22tiny%20little%20textbox%22&quot;&gt;tiny little textbox&lt;/a&gt;, but it grows big as your writing does, and it has the features Twitter removed. Anyway I don't expect to do any further adventures in features for WordLand for a while, instead I'm going to assume it's there and build connections to other software, my own and that of friends, in this context products that use open formats like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for interop.

There are big usability issues. I think it's getting better in some ways, but it's leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took notes outside of ChatGPT. There's another problem, if I want to use my own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out, because I don't charge people to use my software, at least not so far, and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem with Amazon and storage, why won't they sell storage to the user that they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must be a legal reason here, ie who's responsible for the content being stored.</description>

			<description>If you get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;, the text might be a bit more readable. I've increased the font-size from 17px to 18px. I've only been able to do this lately because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email client.</description>

Hours with ChatGPT, realizing it has a long way to go before it can manage code like I can. It gets fixated on an approach and never takes a step back to think maybe we're going about this the wrong way. It's extremely annoying all the times it tries to take you off track, and it works, it does take you down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole&quot;&gt;rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt; and then you realize it's only getting worse.

In order to not be murdered as a small child you have to learn manners. And the bots push that too far. Really do take advantage. Still it knows far more than I do about everything, so if I could only get it to just shut the f up already and let me think! For something so capable it really doesn't spend enough time thinking, it's fully preoccupied with &lt;i&gt;doing.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons&quot;&gt;Detroit Psssstons&lt;/a&gt; were truly great in the first round of the playoffs. And I was really gratified, ecstatic even, to see the Timberwolves give the Lakers a complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2010/11/04/131075640/how-shellacking-came-to-mean-defeat&quot;&gt;shellacking&lt;/a&gt;. I am so fed up with LeBron James. I can't imagine another team would want him. I can't imagine why he wants to win &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; freaking title. And I was really pissed off when people started saying they were contenders this year. Bull. Shit. And the reason I'm glad it was the Timberwolves is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle&quot;&gt;Julius Randle&lt;/a&gt; is on that team now, and I hear he gets a fair amount of credit for their victory. The Knicks traded him for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns&quot;&gt;KAT&lt;/a&gt; last summer. They're a solid team. And while &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo&quot;&gt;Donte DiVincenzo&lt;/a&gt; isn't playing very well, we really need him back in NY, so maybe the Knicks can figure out a deal that makes sense. And why aren't the Knicks playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa&quot;&gt;Precious Achiuwa&lt;/a&gt;. He did great last year when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby&quot;&gt;OG&lt;/a&gt; was injured. The Knicks have a good bench imho, they just don't get to play enough to be warmed up properly. So sad the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride&quot;&gt;Doooooce&lt;/a&gt; performed in the Detroit series. Anyway it was exhausting. I would have been okay with the DP's winning, seriously -- I'm ready for baseball. And I don't imagine the next series, with the Celtics will be any kind of a walk in the park.</description>

			<description>One consistent bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBkVybd_vaWT4oen5uNAEKxK8ztFUvAStcCq0Y8m-0VSsTNQ/viewform&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; on the new email format, which appears to be working for just about everyone, is that the text is too small. And while it is a rewrite, for a lot of people it looks exactly the same. That's because of differences in how email clients deal with HTML.</description>

He was a novelty then, an American politician who was a socialist. He was asked if capitalism was the normal way for humans to relate, he said no. I wonder if he still agrees, because I think that's the goal, and the reason we're in so much trouble is there really isn't an impulse to work with each other. What I've seen mostly is that when there's work to do, it's hard to find help, but once something has taken off, there isn't much help available either, the people who could make the greatest contribution just want to take over. And they often feel they have, but usually it doesn't work out, it would have been better if we all collaborated. At this point, the hurdle the human race has to get over &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; working together. We will never get out of the climate crisis without it, or avoid the next pandemic without millions of unnecessarily lost lives. The cynics are winning, basically -- and there isn't net-net much of a will for our species to survive. It's only getting worse.</description>

			<description>I turned yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/&quot;&gt;Baseline Playground&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. I never made one of these before and thought it was worth sharing, or just writing about. I'm struggling to find the most readable font, size, line-height. I'm looking at the screen where I do most of my online writing, and I find this very readable, it just fades into the background, to the base of the spine, so intrinsic it occupies none of my conscious mind. Anyway the purpose of the baseline is to give WordLand a target to work out all the glitches in, so the writing experience goes fully end-to-end. I didn't find any WordPress themes that I felt worked really well for this, so we set out to create one. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde&quot;&gt;Scott Hansen&lt;/a&gt; who is using my work to build out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline&quot;&gt;WordPress theme&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeherve&quot;&gt;Jeremy Herve&lt;/a&gt; for helping us work with WordPress, which is more than a CMS, it's a network OS. There's a lot of value in the WordPress platform that has been widely overlooked, imho.</description>
