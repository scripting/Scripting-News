We now look for feeds from wordpress sites, and copy the site ID and the ID for each post as channel-level &lt;i&gt;wpSiteId&lt;/i&gt; and item-level &lt;i&gt;wpPostId. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feeder.scripting.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdaveverse.org%2Ffeed%2F&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. This will make &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Edit%20This%20Page%22&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; functionality possible in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;social web&lt;/a&gt; product I'm building now. This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql&quot;&gt;FeedLand level&lt;/a&gt; (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)</description>

			<description>Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make&quot;&gt;Make your own world&lt;/a&gt;. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is becoming more and more of an enemy. It's still my go-to place for most planning and research, which is a very large part of how I use the web. But when it tries to be a human it's a really shitty one, no manners, and very little respect and basically a fucking idiot in many ways, imho ymmv.</description>

			<description>My mother would have been 93 years old today. She died in 2018, seven years ago. As time goes by, I feel her importance in my life more and more.

			<title>What podcasting is</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Posted on Facebook eleven years ago. Still relevant today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. They all had to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A standard format for recording. MP3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, none of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript: The EFF filed suit against the patent troll, but didn't listen to what I said here, which is really fucked up because they didn't create podcasting, I did. There's a tremendous lack of respect for generosity in tech, yet without generosity there's no interop, only silos. Either you made billions from something, or you don't exist. That's why I stopped supporting EFF long ago, even though I gave them what was to me a significant amount of money when they started up, and why they get involved in so many wrong-headed ideas.  They don't respect tech, they respect money.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dermotcasey.bsky.social/post/3lwtrlfyo6s23&quot;&gt;Dermot Casey&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'd add Dave to this list. Things that are obvious in retrospect are never obvious before people like Dave put them together.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The purpose of the National Guard occupation of American cities is to control who votes. It doesn’t take much disruption to turn a blue district red. They just allocated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/big-beautiful-bill-immigration-border-security/&quot;&gt;$170 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fund ICE. They don't need all that money for border enforcement. It's meant to fund the transformation of the US into a Russian-style oligarchy. That's fear-inducing, but Ukraine has been fighting against becoming a  Russian-style oligarchy for decades, with ups and downs, but so far, considerable success.</description>

I wrote: I'd love to have is an &lt;b&gt;idea-sharing network&lt;/b&gt; where i could drop this idea in a box named &quot;helping the US stay free&quot; and have it find it's way to the right people in Ukraine who are saying &quot;if only I could talk to people in the US trying to figure this out, we know so much about this!&quot; That's the thing. How to connect know-how with the place that needs to know. To make our resistance more effective use the lessons learned in Ukraine over the last decades.</description>

It's hard to watch at times, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes&quot;&gt;main character&lt;/a&gt; of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell&quot;&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.</description>

			<description>I want to switch cell providers, so I used ChatGPT to figure out that Consumer Cellular is the best choice for me. I finally get around to filling in the form, and it complains about my zip code. &quot;No service.&quot; Yes I know, there's no cell coverage where I live. I still need a freaking cell phone. Called them, the sales person says maybe it's a problem with your computer. Geez Louise. It's a problem with &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; computer. How many years have they had to fix this stupid bug. I could see if I was buying a landline. But this is a &lt;i&gt;mobile&lt;/i&gt; device. That means it moves. To places with cell coverage.</description>

			<description>What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. You could view a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.</description>

I don't want it giving me answers to questions I didn't ask, because it's trying to navigate in my mind, and it has no information about that, so it's basically always wrong. I keep looking back on problems that took hours to solve because it drove the process and I went along with it. I want to tell it in advance to not make suggestions, to just answer questions. I call this &quot;behave like a computer, not a human.&quot; Because it's a fanstastic computer, but not a good partner.</description>

Then I realized that sometimes in software I'm climbing a cliff that's too tall to climb in one session, so I have to carry a tent and backpack with food and water. I hate this kind of programming more than anything, because it comes from not having a high-level enough runtime to support me in big corner turns. Or not having invested enough time in creating a layer I can build on. Anyway I'm in the middle of one of those corner-turns now. Hell has not broken loose although at times it looks like it might have. I'm being sure not to create another mess that needs to be cleaned up in the future. Not stressful, but I'd rather be doing anything but this. :-)</description>

Also, most projects have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md&quot;&gt;worknotes.md&lt;/a&gt; file, and where there are dates in the source code, the refer back to dates in the worknotes.md file. Not always, but most of the time. Some of the code is very complex, I work really hard to make it simple so it can be worked on, but in some cases it's impossible to make it read casually. But it's all there, all the tools I use to write the code.</description>

My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; is this: &quot;Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information..&quot; The response was basically: &quot;I'm sorry Dave.&quot; Groan. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482&quot;&gt;the details&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I find it's better when developers are free to work with each other, without interference from a big company like Apple. That's why &quot;platform without a platform vendor&quot; was the most important thing about the web. That and the utter simplicity of HTTP and HTML. We lost our way in the early-mid 00s when Twitter took over at the center of the blogosphere. Now you couldn't just work with other developers, first you had to work with Twitter and accept its limits. In one swoop we lost all the features listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; page. I am betting everything on the idea that we can build a collaborative environment like the web was before, and that the Mac had the promise of being before that and at the same time create a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt;, far beyond what Twitter and twitter-like systems can do.</description>

			<description>One more bingeable, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lights_(2023_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Blue Lights&lt;/a&gt; from BBC on HBO Max. I love police dramas, esp British ones. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Peaky Blinders&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Fall&lt;/a&gt;, another British crime drama, and, amazingly they all take place in Belfast, believe it or not, and don't count the number of times people say &quot;wee&quot; in the darndest places in BBC Belfast crime dramas. Do Brits really say &lt;i&gt;wee&lt;/i&gt; all the time? How did I not see that coming.</description>

			<title>It hasn't hit us yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Theory about why we don’t fight to save the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Many of us haven’t personally felt much impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No hyperinflation yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The police still respond as they always have, wearing badges, faces uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The shelves are full at the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The electricity is on, as is the internet. Buses and subways are running. The airports are open. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Obamas and Clintons are still free, living in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not felt yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we’ve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We’ve had no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn’t feel like anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a difference between reading a site in a web browser and it being part of the web. As it turns out what became Web 2.0, all built as silos, could more accurately be called Anti-web 2.0. Underneath all the silos, the heart of the web is still beating.

I'm head-down on other projects and can't do it myself but as I explain in the writeup, it would plug in beautifully to stuff I'm doing and it would all be open, so a new kind of feed reader is possible. And we could find news from other bloggers that the journalists aren't reporting on, the same way we relied on blogs in the early days to learn about what was going on on the web. It's time to do that again.</description>

			<title>I want the web to be like Harvard</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the beginning I wanted the web to be like Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's one of the reasons I went there as a research fellow in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't satisfied with the web, the density of minds wasn't up to my expectations, so I thought if I brought the web to the minds, that might work better. I wanted to work on communication systems for people trying to work together to solve big problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I chose Harvard over MIT, because the web was already strong at MIT, and they weren't friendly to my cause, they were busy trying to reinvent the web when it imho didn't need that. I hoped instead, Harvard, more a school of the liberal arts, would be more open to innovation in communication between people as opposed to between machines. I felt, in 2003, that was a solved problem on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It didn't happen there either, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; did come out of that period, and some of it was lasting, but eventually the university wasn't on board with the web as a community for intellect. Instead what came out of Harvard in that period was Facebook, which is a great accomplishment. I am a FB user to this day and appreciate how well it works at keeping friends from long ago in contact. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still want an intellectual community on the web. That's why I'm putting so much effort into rebuilding it as a writing environment. All this because the writing products of Silicon Valley are always will be silos. As heroic as Ghost has been in supporting ActivityPub that is not the web. The barriers are too high and the features too limited. The web is the web, it's well defined and well understood. And that's where we have to go, and I want the minds to be there or else it wasn't worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>UI in AI is the next frontier</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/08/07/rickAndMorty.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/08/07/chatgpt-5-is-even-more-of-a-bastard-than-4/&quot;&gt;quick review&lt;/a&gt; of ChatGPT 5, after trying a simple programming exercise with it. It was an awful collaboration because it lied to me about its capabilities, leading me to develop a feature in my software to support the capability that it later admitted that it didn't have. I've never had a programming partner do that to me. I've had people who never showed up for work. Or people who were in so far over their heads that it would have been better if they had never shown up. It lied repeatedly, and when cornered it had the audacity to gaslight me. &quot;I understand why you feel that way.&quot; Oh nothing pisses me off more than that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/250807/p29#a250807p29&quot;&gt;other people&lt;/a&gt; don't review it based on its functionality, after all it isn't just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/02/big-tech-ai-spending?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;&gt;money sink&lt;/a&gt;, or a technological breakthrough, it's software that we pay actual money for that is meant to help us in our work. I don't know if it's by design that it's such an asshole. I have a feeling that people are going to focus on this eventually. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is not human, it's like the world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Rick%20and%20Morty%22&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/a&gt;. And we're meant to be one of the many versions of Rick and/or Morty, but which is the real one? Before we lose sight of that, let's keep our heads on, we're still the ones discovering stuff and being creative and entertaining other humans, not the machines. It'll all work a lot better when they're programmed to behave like computers, not these vain and corrupt pseudo humans. Still a breakthrough in search. Really sticks it to Google. Yaaay. That's good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm more worried about AIs killing us by overwhelming our nervous systems than taking our place at work. Has anyone actually used any of the software an AI has written? I know people who have never written software before are in awe, as I am about &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22&quot;&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt; characters I make up, but how does the software it builds rate? If it lies to itself like it lies to me, the software doesn't work at all, even slightly. I'm pretty sure &quot;garbage in garbage out&quot; applies in the new world of software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/09.html#a191740&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'd love to understand how one can be a programmer and not always be searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can think of, ours depends on telling the truth. You can't lie to a compiler is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tech industry doesn't get its relationship with paying human customers. Had a problem with my cell phone service. I started getting emails saying it was shutting off my service because my credit card was being denied. Went to the account on the web and it looked fine. The messages kept coming. I reached out for help. The people couldn't understand what I was saying. I eventually gave up because I didn't understand either. I might have two accounts, I don't know, in some ways it looks like two, in other ways just one. I presume &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; have a way to find out, assuming there are actually any reasoning empathetic human beings who care about doing quality work. If we were talking to each other human to human, not as peripheral devices for a computer network, we might have figured it out in five minutes, instead of having the customer report it on their blog after weeks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bullshit&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt; that did not uncover the truth. We still don't know how many accounts I have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The company is Google. They're good at dealing with imaginary customers not real ones. If they ever understood how to communicate with people, they have forgotten. And of course there's a real possibility that all my conversations were with &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; ChatGPT. If that's true, no wonder we were running around in circles never getting the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>New version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;feedlandSocket&lt;/a&gt;. It's now an NPM package you can include in Node projects. The demo is more useful, and there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q-ks3uytZI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of what it looks like as it scrolls through the JavaScript console. WebSockets + feeds. A fairly important component of an open social web system.</description>

			<description>I recorded a good podcast yesterday about how I develop new stuff like podcasting, and how it only works if there isn't a huge dominant platform vendor to FUD the project. That's why RSS worked, sort of -- we did get FUDded by the RDF folk, who had a few famous people on their list of co-authors, and it put a big scar on RSS when it was just starting to grow. We cleaned up their mess after a while, and then it boomed, thanks to the New York Times. This is what usually happens, in markets that are controlled by a big company. Google has that effect, so does Apple as does the W3C. They force everything to stop and go through a process that simply doesn't work, it doesn't yield innovation in the market, because it wasn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/10/howToBootstrapFederated140.html&quot;&gt;bootstrapped&lt;/a&gt;.  That's why I don't like the idea of &quot;Podcasting 2.0&quot; whatever it is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@adam@podcastindex.social/114978962778121264&quot;&gt;Adam Curry says&lt;/a&gt; on Masto that it's all a big misunderstanding, but that's what the RDF people said too. Who cares what the name is. Everyone cares, when it comes to the name of a standard or protocol. And when you have an Apple or Google or IETF  trying to confuse people about what you're doing, well you can't make any progress on interop. They freeze everything because users and developers will wait for them. Of course that's what &quot;Podcasting 2.0&quot; is all about. To make all the ideas flow through &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasting2.org/&quot;&gt;one place&lt;/a&gt;. And whoever they are (ChatGPT &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/07/isTherePodcastingTwoPointOh.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's Adam Curry btw) they didn't even bring the power of an Apple or Google to the table. They have nothing other than their aspiration to own the name of an open format and protocol that made the world a little happier for a while. For that of course someone has to try to own it. That's basically what I said, in a very long-winded way, in the podcast. I also talked about ways we could move forward anyway even though there is a 800-pound would-be gorilla trying to own our playground. Maybe I'll just release the podcast as-is and ask you all to indulge me for my need to say the same thing far too many times with so much vigor. :-)</description>
