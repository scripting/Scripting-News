I was explaining how I wanted to see a whole market of editors. You could see them as &quot;For WordPress&quot; but there's another way to look at them. They're plug-in replacements for the dreaded &quot;tiny little textboxes&quot; we see in twitter-like systems. Those awful little things. We know so many ways to make better editors. Now imagine that we store your Mastodon posts in WordPress documents (we do). And you see how the pieces start to fit together. Think of WordPress as the command line of the social web. And it really will be the web, not a promise of someday maybe being the web. It's like a Wordle puzzle. You have to move the parts around until you see a picture develop. Another fun thing, WordPress has a great simple REST api that's been around since 2017, and it covers most of the product functionality and is debugged, scaled and stable. It probably is the simplest API for ActivityPub. Now does that blow your mind? This is how you know this is the web, because your mind keeps exploding once you realize the things you could do just by connecting two things together and it works because they interop. Matthias has been working on this stuff since 2008. Our paths didn't cross until earlier this year.</description>

			<description>There have been reports of people having trouble using &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;.

It would be helpful if people with accounts could do a short test post.

			<description>A bunch of new people are trying out FeedLand news products. I haven't looked at them in a long time. I'm glad they're looking, but most of my demo news products were broken. Oy. It was hard to untangle. It should be a lot easier, and next time I can dig in and do it over I think it will be. Anyway as I convert my demos, I'll list them here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mlbriver.com/&quot;&gt;mblriver.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://politics.newsriver.org/&quot;&gt;politics.newsriver.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggers.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;bloggers.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dave.podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;dave.podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Here's an idea. Why doesn't Apple make a laptop with a light shining out to highlight the user's face so they look better when they're on a Zoom call. I bet someone makes a device like this to clip on a laptop. Right??</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is great at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG&quot;&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt;. Describe the icon you want and in a few iterations you have it, even if it's not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I would have killed to have this a few years ago, before FA came out. This is the best of both -- use FA if they have the right icon, design your own if they don't. It also makes me think that now perhaps SVG-based user interfaces are within the realm of possibility. CSS is no way to design UIs. I have a podcast in the pipe about this. If you want to know what I mean, look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/misc/quickdrawApiSummary.pdf&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/19/152802.html&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>To people who read my blog. If you have a quick thought about something you read here, it's ok if you send me an email. It should be short and not personal, if it adds some info or perspective that might be interesting, or if you just agree feverishly (not so much if you disagree, please) drop me a line. My return address on the nightly emails is my real email address. And you can find the address on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=about&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. Also sometime soon I think there will be a way to read my blog inside WordLand, so you can post a response to something I wrote, on your own blog, and I can get a link to it. I think this is the best of both worlds. You maintain the integrity of your blog, all your comments are in the same place, and if I think my readers would benefit, I can link it into my blog. I don't think we need comments, in other words. I think our blogs are powerful enough with some new code.</description>

It's from 1996, I was reporting from a tech conference I was at where there were all angry men on stage threatening everyone else. They may not have known they were doing that, but it was awful. And so different from the web we were just beginning to understand at that time. I'm going to start going through the posts that I remember making a difference at the time. No better way for me to remember what the web is, going back to these memories when it was all fresh and new, before the leaders of tech realized what was going on. Google didn't ship for another two years. It probably wasn't even in development at the time. Yet I think the last section is a good anthem for the web, for those of us who think it's time to cut pop all the bullshit off the stack and get back to our roots.</description>

			<source:outline text="I've gotten a lovely response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;Que Sera Sera&lt;/a&gt; post I linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/09/13/001819.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's from 1996, I was reporting from a tech conference I was at where there were all angry men on stage threatening everyone else. They may not have known they were doing that, but it was awful. And so different from the web we were just beginning to understand at that time. I'm going to start going through the posts that I remember making a difference at the time. No better way for me to remember what the web is, going back to these memories when it was all fresh and new, before the leaders of tech realized what was going on. Google didn't ship for another two years. It probably wasn't even in development at the time. Yet I think the last section is a good anthem for the web, for those of us who think it's time to cut pop all the bullshit off the stack and get back to our roots." created="Mon, 15 Sep 2025 15:07:23 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/05/13/modernTimes.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/09/15.html#a150723"/>

			<title>feedland.org or feedland.com?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This question has come up quite a bit lately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't know that there are two places you can use FeedLand, feedland.org and feedland.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of history here, and some uncertainty about the future, so there's not much I can do other than explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First you're welcome to use either of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;feedland.org is running on a simple small server on Digital Ocean, and feedland.com is on Automattic's VIP network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If feedland.org gets overloaded, it gets slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;if feedland.com gets overloaded, it adds more servers and should stay about the same at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You should pick one and use it and not have two accounts, but people accidentally create them, because in some places we point to .com and in others we the default is .org. It's because we haven't gotten it together yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are also performance issues on .com -- ones that we still need to address. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's about all I can say at this point. At the same time I'm working on a whole other product while all this is happening, and I'm not that young, and really can only work so many hours a day before I have to stop. A fact. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I'm really glad so many new people are trying FeedLand. I use it myself in so many ways. And it will be deeply integrated with WordLand in the next release. I'm not kidding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A very smart application of AI. Google could add it to the debugger. When my program crashes deep in jQuery code, with no stack crawl, it could suggest what the problem might be without me have to try to describe it for ChatGPT. The Google AI debugger would be able to look everywhere any anywhere in the virtual machine. Much faster than I can. As a programmer I hope they're working on this. Or maybe it's already out in testing form?</description>

The name of the product was Really Simple Something. I said it was the first I heard of it. I did a little digging using ChatGPT and found they can do this, it’s not illegal or unethical. But it’s also true that you could invent a new format and call it HTML even if it isn’t what we think of as HTML today . The W3C would have no recourse. If you wanted to make a new CSS to compete with the existing CSS, no one can stop you, and you can call it CSS. Not a good way to run the internet imho. But that appears that's how it works. So as much as I didn't like what they did, esp the fact that the first I heard of it was a public announcement, and had no time to prepare or maybe even help them do something better, I guess we have to accept it. RSS has been through this before and came out okay. I just wish it would stop at some point. It's a useful thing, deserves &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/09/11/123936.html#a124132&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; and support, not just from me, but from everyone, esp people who run companies that depend on it. You benefit as much as I do. End of sermon.</description>

			<title>Embrace the creativity of others</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in October 1996 after attending a conference of the tech industry that as it turns out was in its final stages. This was one of the last times it met. I was coming from the web, and wanted to see if anyone else was ready to change how we work with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been following that ideal ever since, people seem to misinterpret it for subservience or weakness, or a pretense to cover another kind of greed, when it's really sincere, and all about strength. Sometimes people say yes, and when that happens magical things happen. I swear to god. I've been there. I've done it, it's not something you can do on your own, by definition. It's rare when people actually help each other and thereby create something. It's why the Beatles are such a great story. Someday I still hope to be part of a group like that. Right now, it's still &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; everyone for themself.  That is breaking. Read the news. But I believe if we did start really collaborating and not just talking about it, things would change very very quickly. Things would happen that can't happen until we work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had it figured out in 1996, but still haven't figured out how to make it happen, and time &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; running out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I had a great time, and learned a lot. It's interesting that while I am not a member of the WordPress community, there is a big intersection between that community and one I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; belong to -- the web. WordPress was founded on the principles and idealism of the web. It's baked in. So it might be the largest community of users, not exclusively developers, who have the same values as the web, which are very very powerful values. I'm rediscovering them and it's wonderful. It means I can plug your app into my server and they work first time. It's the &lt;i&gt;just works&lt;/i&gt; part that makes it the web. It makes you suck in your breath and go, I'm there now. One interesting thing that came up was the subject of altruism, which is something I reject re myself. It doesn't work if what I do is altruism, because we all must be somewhat committed to the success of our competitors, because if we don't we are locking people in. It's so important that users have freedom of movement. If they don't things stagnate like our 19 years of Twitter. I'm going to be Nathan's show again, and again if he'll have me, to check in on the progress of my humble project to create a new layer, combining WordPress and all the other good stuff that isn't hooked up to it yet. I could not have hoped for a better introduction to The Land of WordPress.</description>

So it might be the largest community of users, not exclusively developers, who have the same values as the web, which are very very powerful values. I'm rediscovering them and it's wonderful. It means I can plug your app into my server and they work first time. It's the &lt;i&gt;just works&lt;/i&gt; part that makes it the web. It makes you suck in your breath and go, I'm there now. One interesting thing that came up was the subject of altruism, which is something I reject re myself. It doesn't work if what I do is altruism, because we all must be somewhat committed to the success of our competitors, because if we don't we are locking people in. It's so important that users have freedom of movement. If they don't things stagnate like our 19 years of Twitter. I'm going to be Nathan's show again, and again if he'll have me, to check in on the progress of my humble project to create a new layer, combining WordPress and all the other good stuff that isn't hooked up to it yet. I could not have hoped for a better introduction to The Land of WordPress." created="Fri, 12 Sep 2025 14:47:32 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/09/12.html#a144732"/>

			<title>It's really simple</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reminder: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;Sept 18&lt;/a&gt;, one week from today, is the 3rd anniversary of the 20th anniversary of the release of RSS 2.0. I often forget to mark that day. It's not an event that's marked by others very often, but in my humble opinion, it deserves more respect than it gets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Around the time of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; I decided to swing back and see what more we could do with RSS. It had been sitting there basically going nowhere for most of those 20 years. I want to be clear, there were good and useful products created and supported, but there was none of the innovation that would have happened if it hadn't been so severely injured by Google and the many VC-backed startups hacking away at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A format like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; has to be loved. And if you make it too complicated or vague, with too much political shuffling of the deck what you get is ActivityPub. That's what RSS would have become if it went down the path the tech industry wanted to take it down. We have a perfect artifact to look at. An A-B comparison. Couldn't be more stark. And, after almost 23 years, RSS is still simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, around the 20th anniversary, in the leadup to it, I decided if no one else was going to invest in RSS, I would, and let's see what comes of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The result was &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; which is fundamentally different from all the other feed readers in that its subscription model is patterned after the twitter-like social media apps. Everyone's subscription list is public. I can look at your list and you can look at mine. You can also put categories on the feeds you subscribe to and route them to other servers doing other things, through the magic of the web. And get this -- you can even subscribe to a category of my subscriptions. Lots of power there, but still it's simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FeedLand is the perfect back-end for a twitter-like system, for the feeds part. And for the words, the perfect back-end is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I only discovered that about 1.5 years ago. And I had to see what it looks like. No more &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny little text boxes&lt;/a&gt;, WordLand is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;real editor&lt;/a&gt; that supports the basic writing features of the web. How do I know? Because it saves its data in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. That has come to be the defining format for the text-based web. One which has been totally ignored by the twitter-like systems. Markdown is like MP3. If you're mixing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/20/141957.html&quot;&gt;sound into feeds&lt;/a&gt; you use MP3 of course. It's there for you to use. As was Markdown. If you're mixing text you're mixing Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So while everyone was dancing on Twitter's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster_fire&quot;&gt;dumpster fire&lt;/a&gt; of a social network I decided to build on something much bigger. The web. RSS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. WordPress and FeedLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;i&gt;Really Simple Syndication&lt;/i&gt; is supposed to make you smile, while most techie formats make you want to pull your hair out. RSS reads pretty well even if you know nothing about feeds and XML. I wish the browser people hadn't insisted on masking it with ugly CSS style sheets. I like lifting the hood of a car to see what's there even though I don't know what many of the things in there do. I learn by doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;RSS isn't ugly, it's brilliant, and shouldn't be fear-inducing, hence the promise: it's really simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Brent &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he cares about desktop software but not about phone and tablet versions of same. I found that liberating. It's always been a pain in the ass to do something beautiful on the desktop only to have to destroy its utility by squeezing it into a space with no keyboard or pointing device that's more accurate than my finger (I have huge fingers, and a normal size phone). I found it liberating, but -- I'm working on the design of an app that should work well on either a phone or a laptop, and I've had that in mind the whole life of the product. But now I realize in a new way that it's a choice. It always was, but it didn't &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; that way.</description>

			<title>Bullet points from yesterday's podcast</title>

It got a shitty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/22/movies/film-review-a-sickening-catalogue-of-sins-every-one-of-them-deadly.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT, which usually means I won't bother with something, but this time I decided to give it a try. The reviewer, Janet Maislin, didn't like the acting of Brad Pitt. I thought Pitt was an unlikeable jerk, but I also thought that was the role, but maybe I was wrong. I didn't care. I also couldn't figure out what city it was. It wasn't NY, but Maislin says it was. Usually in a movie set in NY, I recognize many of the locations. There are only a few places movies are shot in the city. But again, I didn't care. What keeps me thinking about it is the story. I'm not going to spoil it. Don't read any reviews before watching it, they pretty much all get in the way of the storytelling.</description>

Most women are infertile since some unspecified disaster, and the ones who can reproduce exist only to reproduce. There are women who clean the house, and do a few other things. There are certainly other books, movies and series worth tuning into, but these are the ones I recommend now. Handmaid's Tale is also a book, which I have read, but the show on Hulu goes into more detail.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://socketdemo.feedland.org/&quot;&gt;New demo app&lt;/a&gt;. FeedLand communicates back to the client app via websockets. This is absolutely the easiest way to get flow from feeds to apps running on servers or in a browser, or other desktop app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;Websockets&lt;/a&gt; is a mature &lt;a href=&quot;https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt;, and incredibly useful. I'm now working on a toolkit for it, along with all the other projects going on in parallel, so other developers can hook into &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; to get the flow of new items. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://socketdemo.feedland.org/&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; shows you the JSON version of every news item as it appears on the wire. There's no limit to the kinds of apps you can build for this. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Chuck%20Shotton%22&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; Chuck Shotton has a market-predicting LLM app that gets its news this way. Nothing to install on a server. FeedLand does all the work. I expect to have a toolkit out sometime in the few weeks.</description>

This is absolutely the easiest way to get flow from feeds to apps running on servers or in a browser, or other desktop app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;Websockets&lt;/a&gt; is a mature &lt;a href=&quot;https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt;, and incredibly useful. I'm now working on a toolkit for it, along with all the other projects going on in parallel, so other developers can hook into &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; to get the flow of new items. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://socketdemo.feedland.org/&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; shows you the JSON version of every news item as it appears on the wire. There's no limit to the kinds of apps you can build for this. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Chuck%20Shotton%22&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; Chuck Shotton has a market-predicting LLM app that gets its news this way. Nothing to install on a server. FeedLand does all the work. I expect to have a toolkit out sometime in the few weeks." created="Sun, 07 Sep 2025 17:15:37 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/09/07.html#a171537"/>

			<description>Another application for websockets. You could actually put a web server on your desktop without exposing your home network to the world. I can't wait till I have time to play around with this.</description>

			<title>New version of FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a new version of FeedLand, v0.7.0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/68&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where we discussed the testing of the new release. It worked everywhere we installed it, so it seems fair to open it up to people running their own FeedLand instances. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only features it adds are ones needed to use it with the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, coming soon now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if you have the time, it requires an update to the database, so it's not the usual thing. It explains at the beginning of the thread what the change is to the database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/sep2025transition.md&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for doing the upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're installing a new instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.md&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; are the same as always.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble, post a note on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/68&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Scott Hanson for validating the new version. It's always important to have someone to check my work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>About feedland.org</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/09/05.html#a145720&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; on scripting.com about feedland.org was not the whole story. In the end I thought it made more sense to start the database over from the start.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were a few users who subscribed to feeds that were constantly updating, and they never came back to use FeedLand. So as soon as I started it back up it started loading new items at a very high rate, and after a couple of hours it was still going. There aren't that many people using feedland.org, so I thought the best thing to do is to start over and hopefully people will figure out how to resubscribe to the feeds they want to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I felt that people might be able to use a few tips on how to get going again, so that's what this post is about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign off and on&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First thing you should do is sign off and sign back on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You will still have the credentials in your browser, but the server doesn't know about them, so when you try to do something that requires you being logged in it will fail. But if you sign off and on again, that will take care of that problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To sign off, choose the command in the system menu at the right end of the menubar. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once you're signed off the only option will be to sign back on. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/06/signoff.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restore subscription list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How to restore from a backup of your subscription list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From the first menu, choose Subscribe/From an OPML File.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/06/subscribeToOpml.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/248&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the support site for questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I upgraded &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt; to a new version of the system software, still being tested. In the process I started a fresh items table. This means for the next day or so your timeline may have a lot of items for a few feeds, as it catches up with every feed it keeps track of. The server was down for a couple of hours while we did the upgrade. Still diggin! ;-)</description>

It may already be too late. Look at what's happening politically in the US now and ask how tolerant the government is going to be of an open web. We always had to deal with the possibility that they would shut down free speech here. It has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt;, didn't work in the 90s. But the guardrails that existed then possibly don't exist now. The same things that are forcing CBS for example to become a controlled press, may affect the web too, but you won't read about it in the NYT or hear about it on Maddow because they have low regard for non-professional people writing on the web.</description>

			<description>ChatGPT might not give you the best answer. Yesterday I hit a problem with the MySQL hosting service, and as we worked it out, ChatGPT and me, I ended up contacting the ISP's support asking them to restart the server, something I cannot do through the control panel. They don't do that, and made a couple of suggestions which didn't seem to make sense based on what ChatGPT had told me. So I tried what they suggested and it worked, and went back to ChatGPT and asked what it thought, and it said yes of course that worked, and would you like me to show you how to do it even better. I guess it takes a path and never goes back to see if there isn't a better one. We've been through this before. Anyway, always be circumspect about it's advice, it's not just hallucinations you need to watch for. That said, with help from both ChatGPT and Digital Ocean, I now have a better setup, and it should run without the problem we hit yesterday.</description>

			<description>AI is as good at writing software as it is in creating competent visual art. It's only amazing in terms of how much more a novice can do. It doesn't mean what they create is interesting in more than a gee-wiz way, and the novelty fades pretty quickly I've found.</description>
