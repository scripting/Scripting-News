			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/09.html&quot;&gt;September 2004&lt;/a&gt; was the month when podcasting became a real community thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html&quot;&gt;Twenty years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;podcasting got its name&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them &quot;audio blog posts&quot; or some variant thereof. You can see it in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; graph. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;special feed&lt;/a&gt; to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;Apple's podcast&lt;/a&gt; database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. &lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

With billions of windfall from the success of Twitter, why argue over nickels and dimes. That's what I always wondered about the thinking behind Medium.

			<title>Bluesky vs Mastodon as open APIs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Neither one is in a particularly strong position. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like &quot;fediverse&quot; get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working &lt;i&gt;together. &lt;/i&gt;It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a &quot;market of one&quot; and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder, I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the success of the company.</description>

			<description>Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook&quot;&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook&quot;&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sun, 01 Sep 2024 16:45:43 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/09/01.html#a164543"/>
