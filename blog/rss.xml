			<description>This period is often a time of innovation in the world of blogs, podcasting and feeds. For me this year, I'm using the time to do more work on CSS and basic user interface stuff for &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and for news products like &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, which has been surprisingly popular. The new stuff will start showing up first in that site, pretty soon. The goal is to build on its popularity, to bootstrap a new platform.</description>

			<description>I also want to write a bit more about RSS support in Bluesky, what it means, and ideas for next steps. BTW, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/25/emailToJayAtBluesky.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the email I sent to Jay Graber, the CEO of Bluesky, on Dec 12, asking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; support, which was released publicly ten days later on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/22.html&quot;&gt;Dec 22&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I made a change to how images are served from this blog, to see if the images are still blocked by GMail. Previously we redirected to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/santa.png&quot;&gt;S3 file&lt;/a&gt;, so we could use HTTPS and but not have to have the bits flow through one of my Digital Ocean servers, which after this change, they now do. For most of you this will be blah blah whatever blah blah zzzz, but some people may find it interesting.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;We can now subscribe to Bluesky feeds in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/23/subscribeScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Subscribe sub-menu&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;i&gt;To one feed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Enter the URL of a Bluesky profile page. For example, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/neilhimself.neilgaiman.com&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to Neil Gaiman's profile. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When this feature came out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/22.html#a193746&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it didn't work with FeedLand because we were looking for full URLs pointing to a feed in their feed discovery link and they provided a relative URL.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fix was in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;feedHunter package&lt;/a&gt;, it now looks for relative URLs and makes them full before trying to find the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I understand why they used a relative URL, they're getting ready to federate and it's probably simpler for them to just specify a relative URL.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I think this is going to be a problem -- in the world of feeds, software usually expects full URLs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is what a Bluesky feed &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fbsky.app%2Fprofile%2Fdid%3Aplc%3Apn5qdowybxjewkcq6zzenvtq%2Frss&quot;&gt;looks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/23/blueskyfeedinfeedlandscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; in FeedLand on Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In the reporting on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2&quot;&gt;Colorado Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; and the 14th Amendment, I've not heard the most basic reason why Trump can't be President. Here's why. He took an &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/&quot;&gt;oath&lt;/a&gt; to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He did the opposite, he attacked the Constitution. So how can we ask him to take the same oath again, the one that he violated the last time he took it. The Constitution is very wise, it's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou&quot;&gt;Maya Angelou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371&quot;&gt;taught&lt;/a&gt; -- when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. That's why he can't be president again. He can't be believed when he takes the oath, and if he can't take the oath he can't be President.</description>

Here's why. He took an &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/&quot;&gt;oath&lt;/a&gt; to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He did the opposite, he attacked the Constitution. So how can we ask him to take the same oath again, the one that he violated the last time he took it. The Constitution is very wise, it's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou&quot;&gt;Maya Angelou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371&quot;&gt;taught&lt;/a&gt; -- when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. That's why he can't be president again. He can't be believed when he takes the oath, and if he can't take the oath he can't be President." created="Sat, 23 Dec 2023 01:17:22 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/22.html#a011722"/>

I'm much better at it this go-around than the last time. Generally I can get it done in three or four moves. If it takes five it's because I made a mistake or took a gamble on the second move that didn't work out. These days I don't even try for the second move, but this morning, on the first move I got four out of the five letters, and got the correct position of two of the four. It took a couple of seconds to see that there was really only one answer, so I decided to risk it, and there was this moment we yearn for when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg&quot;&gt;letters reveal&lt;/a&gt; one at a time, all green, a final correct move, in two. First time I've ever gotten that result. I wasn't even sure it was possible. Well there it is. Almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/22/9999.png&quot;&gt;perfect&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Conversation vs publishing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Conversation has a place, but I think we've explored that pretty well, and now I want to create better publishing and reading systems, that are as fast as social web systems, but place less emphasis on replies that can be seen by everyone, because that often is not really conversation, it's spam. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think ultimately we'll be disappointed with federation for all the reasons we're frustrated with earlier social web systems. People trying to get attention for their ideas, which often are spam or trolling. I also think this means RSS will be more valuable going forward because it's great at publishing, checking all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to build with and around WordPress. I think of WordPress as a basic platform the way I saw Twitter between 2006 and 2022. Now the question is what are the steps to use WordPress as the back-end of a social communication system. Behind the scenes, its database has all the capabilities we need to provide the tools writers need. And it has excellent RSS support. It all runs at scale and has a mature yet simple API.  That is all we need to form a hub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ChatGPT is my CSS advisor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who don't program must not have any idea how much of a boon ChatGPT is to us programmers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; coding far in advance of my previous capability. When I know something is possible, but I haven't the slightest idea how to specify it, I just ask, in my own words. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, a very common thing to want to do is to put a : after the text in the first column every row of a table. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/b19c1c8d-3e19-4039-86aa-803eb7cf46d6&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; how to do it, in English, as I did above. This is what it came up with:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tr td:first-child::after {content: &quot;:&quot;;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you see it like that you can almost figure out what's going on if you squint and close one eye. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And it works. I literally shrieked when it did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I am the boss of CSS.. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's possible they'll decide that the Constitution applies to every officer of the United States government except the president and vice-president, I'd love to hear the reason, and if they do, we'll know that we've already lost." created="Wed, 20 Dec 2023 13:53:41 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/20.html#a135341"/>

			<description>If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I'd like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There's nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we're on leads, and don't give people a reason to hope that it's not as serious as it is.</description>

			<title>They're letting us have RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Assume that FB doesn't really want to interop, so that's why there's a year timeline on developing AP functionality. No rush. Let's keep growing and later on we can have an app store that only lets certain sites into our world, subject to our turning them off at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assuming this is true, RSS is their worst nightmare. It's implemented in a week, if you're really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vociferous&quot;&gt;vociferous&lt;/a&gt; users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they're pissing in the wind. I am doing CSS coding far in advance of my previous capability, when I know something is possible, but I haven't the slightest idea how to specify it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember they said RSS is Dead. I always felt that was aimed at me, but it was aimed at them too, even more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing to do, build -- intelligently, slowly, showing interop at every step. Watch out for people who take stuff out with out putting back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>There's actual news tonight</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/231219/p55#a231219p55&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; tonight, when there's some &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/19/us/trump-colorado-ballot-news#trump-colorado-ballot-14th-amendment&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, and it's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;What they're not saying is that the US has the tools to defend itself from enemies like Trump, and finally we're starting to use them. Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html&quot;&gt;last resort&lt;/a&gt; to keep a nightmare out of the government.  An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters. But -- better late than never. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if they want to have a civil war, okay -- better to do it when the military is under constitutional control, at least theoretically. Tell the Republicans to try again, now before any primary votes have been cast. This candidate is prohibited from being president, as if he were born outside the United States. Not qualified. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Music at The Colony</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;The Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. It's small venue that &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/&quot;&gt;goes way back&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/19/levinBrothers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Levin Brothers band at The Colony, Sunday night. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt;, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin&quot;&gt;Pete Levin&lt;/a&gt; on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To me, music is as software probably is to most people who use it. I love it, but I don't have much of an idea of how it's made. The last few years I've been reintroduced to it in a new way, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention&quot;&gt;thanks&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE&quot;&gt;Get Back documentary&lt;/a&gt;, which gave us a view into the Beatles' creative process, something I wish I could have seen when I was much younger. The Beatles were the music my generation grew up with, but I never really even understood that there was a difference between a John song and a Paul song. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second great influence has been Andrew Hickey's &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;500 songs&lt;/a&gt; podcast. Now I have so many more stories to go with the music that my life was formed by. And I have a feeling that attending this event on Sunday will turn out to be a similar influence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, what music should I go see next? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The concert was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nippertown.com/2023/12/18/concert-review-the-levin-brothers-the-linda-12-16-2023/&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;The Colony&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. It's small venue that &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/&quot;&gt;goes way back&lt;/a&gt;. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back." created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:05:07 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a130507"/>

				<source:outline text="I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt;, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform." created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:29:05 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/19.html#a132905"/>

And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for Brent's account on Bluesky, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho.

			<description>One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account to feed we do with sites that support &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html&quot;&gt;feed discovery&lt;/a&gt;. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for Bluesky. I expect we'll do that for FeedLand via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter&quot;&gt;FeedHunter package&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>The last episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png&quot;&gt;Oh The Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

People joke about how we spend our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it's true, I do it. Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online. How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of the links generated by their CMS are broken.)</description>

He's a great talker and story-teller and philosopher, and a great human being. I had never heard him interviewed before, or read anything written by him, but I watched all his TV shows in the 70s. The people in them were people from my neighborhood, but funnier. Why should it be surprising that the stories this man told in real life were the same ones he told in his scripts. Now I want to find more interviews with him. Great stuff.</description>

			<description>No matter how hard we try, no matter how much we want to make a difference, for most of us, all the difference we make happens when we're alive, there is no lasting value to our existence after we're gone. Most people know that, but some people (like me) struggle against it.</description>

			<description>I'm starting to scope out if it would be possible to create an Electron version of FeedLand. I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/e825efea-c271-4c24-8594-01a03c21f3af&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with ChatGPT about that. We did not arrive at a plan. FeedLand uses MySQL, I can't convert to another SQL, we have to use the same codebase in all versions. If, after reading the chat, you have ideas, please post a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/282&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Disneyland on the internet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/111591319022264255&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trying to wrap my head around the idea of Facebook in the Fediverse. This is a company that strives to deliver Disneyland on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who cares if a node blocks them, what's really going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVF4kebiks4&amp;t=50s&quot;&gt;bake your noodle&lt;/a&gt; is when they run access to the fediverse like Apple manages their App Store. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that is how it's going to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're also going to implement Facebook-only APIs, and you're going to want to support them, because they give you access to many millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might be better for the Fediverse if they're just bluffing, but don't be so sure you're going to like the way it works once they're fully in (if they ever are).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/16/threads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;How ChatGPT visualized Threads as I described it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/07/140505.html&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, I'm beggin you -- get those RSS 2.0 feeds in there asap, and hook up with Mastodon now.

			<title>You're supposed to know</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you all know, I was a math major in college. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the weirdest choice for me because, until my first semester of college, not been interested in math. I thought it was boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out math &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt; boring, the teachers were boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a math professor in freshman year, at Lehman College, in the Bronx, who showed me first that I could do it, and then led me to the discovery that hey this is amazing. So I majored in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't do great, B-minus average. But there was one class I got an A in, a summer class (in New Orleans), and it was the only class I took. I think that made a big difference, I could just focus on this one subject. My mind has always been like that, I like to zoom in on things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I remember one day, almost 50 years ago, the professor was standing in front of the class, fuming, angry. We had all turned in proofs that didn't work and that included grad students, he pointed out (I was an undergrad). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He said this: &quot;You're supposed to know when you've proven it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Might be the most important thing I learned from all the math. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not math if your proof doesn't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years later I'm a grad student in Computer Science, and a teaching assistant for a class in assembly language. First semester I was learning it along with the students, although I had already had a class in assembly, you don't really learn it until you teach it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I promised to post example code on the door of my office for students to copy if they needed help on an assignment. I did. When I got back, one of my office mates, whose name I remember to this day, was, like my math prof at Tulane, fuming, this time at me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She said this -- you have to run your code before you post it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was fire coming out of her eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was right. I was shamed. And obviously never forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same story really. A proof that doesn't work isn't math. And code that doesn't run isn't software.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>So, with the &quot;Bloggers&quot; category not yet ready for prime time, I've replaced it with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=all&quot;&gt;All category&lt;/a&gt; from FeedLand, changing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/14/newstab.png&quot;&gt;title to News&lt;/a&gt;. I know it's confusing. I think there's going to be a fair amount of this kind of shuffling in the weeks and months ahead, as we try to fit news and blogs together in interesting ways. You can read the Bloggers category on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, even with &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; no longer on the home page of scripting.com, it still gets more hits than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;. There's something there to look at. I want to do more to integrate the blog and the news. To make some kind of new publication that has a bunch of voices, yet doesn't spin out of control.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/wNEiUxkuAijRBY4L7&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: What if I asked you for a list of your favorite blogs? It could be a podcast, or a tech news site. Something you think every Scripting News reader should see when there's something new? Just curious to know what news sources people think are the most interesting, valuable.</description>

I started watching the new one, and all of a sudden the two princes, William and Harry, are actual people. I have a lot of trouble with that, because of course I remember when they were born. However I'm pretty sure I'll go all the way through. There are a lot of hours of entertainment in The Crown and a few scenes that are truly spectacular (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;). I remember the really good ones of course, but there's an awful lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schlock&quot;&gt;schlock&lt;/a&gt;. One scene I had not remembered was a pretty good illustration of how fucked up people can be. Princess Diana had just gone on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqe-SuyAyWI&quot;&gt;tour of NYC&lt;/a&gt;, her first international tour on her own, and it was (surprising to her) a huge success. Another British invasion. The people of NYC loved Diana (at least in the show, I don't remember this, I was living in California at the time). So she comes home, and the royal family, instead of cheering her, were angry with her for being so charming. Go figure. Her husband, Prince Charles is yelling at her and he asks her if she ever considered how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla&quot;&gt;Camilla&lt;/a&gt;, Charles' one true love, would feel about Diana being so popular. Diana is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gobsmacked&quot;&gt;gobsmacked&lt;/a&gt; (as am I). Why would she think of that. How totally fucked up is that. Why should anyone, being themselves, being happy, worry about how anyone else might feel about their happiness? I've been in Diana's position a few times, achieving success, much deserved, and was reminded that this upset people who (apparently) didn't want me to succeed? I have even been asked that question. If you ever feel that way, that someone else's happiness is meant to make you feel bad, remember Carl Sagan's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; video. Really, &lt;i&gt;no one cares&lt;/i&gt; if you are offended by someone else's happiness. Remember, none of this stuff amounts to anything in the big picture. We're very small, all of us put together, in the grand scheme of things. So if you're happy, good for you! And one other question -- is re-bingeing actually a word?? &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: 0.6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I addressed the How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write. I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love my writing. Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We weren't very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440&quot;&gt;hear from them&lt;/a&gt;, and that's especially lovely.</description>

We have to think more broadly. What are the benefits we want from interop in social media. Federation isn't itself a benefit. It's an idea hatched by techies who aren't thinking about how people actually use these systems and which features are valued and which are problematic. Imho, what's valued is the ability to publish something quickly, and without much fuss, and follow others, again easily without having to have a deep understanding of how these things are architected. No one but us programming plumbers cares. I think the idea of &lt;i&gt;conversation&lt;/i&gt; not only is overrated, but it's where all the problems are, where all the abuse happens. If we focus on the benefits, quick dissemination of news, and the power of the individual to choose their sources and share them with others -- that's where the juice is. Imho of course, ymmv, praise Murphy, I am not a lawyer and my mother loved me, even though at times it was hard to tell. &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: 0.4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Along the way he wondered how I find something to write every day. The answer -- I don't find things to write, it doesn't work that way. I don't sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write 1000 words and it doesn't matter what it's about. If I have something to say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say, because I'm always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get there. A lot of trial and error, let's see if this way of putting it works, or that one, etc. There's a slogan for this -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html&quot;&gt;Narrate Your Work&lt;/a&gt; -- and my work is narratable and creates its own record because I do my work right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it. And if I can get the people I need to listen to me, ie read my blog, then we can work together (a recurring theme) to make great communication systems out of the web and avoid flushing our future down the toilet, which we always seem to be doing.</description>

			<description>Another time I blog about is when I figure something out that I've been trying to understand for a long time, in some cases my whole life. That still happens. The other day I found myself talking with a friend about love, why when someone says &quot;I love you&quot; it doesn't mean what it seems to. Love comes from understanding someone well enough that you know what they desire, what they ache to have, and you to try to help them get it. See all the qualifications in that. Try. Help. Them. In other words, you can love someone when you know them. And you don't give them what they want, you help them get it. You can't love someone who your whole idea of is based on a dream you have about them. That's different. Anyway, lots more to say about all this. It's a recurring topic. It might be the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; topic. Someday they'll invent an AI that can analyze my writing and tell me if I've ever written for any other purpose than being worthy of love.</description>
