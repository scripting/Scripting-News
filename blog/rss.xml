This time, unlike the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; it was tried, it worked. We're in the post-coup world now. He showed us exactly what he would do if he could and we somehow collectively acted as if he hadn't shown us. Sanewashing was just the tip of the iceberg, you can't blame it on the press, we didn't demand they get their shit together, we didn't try to change the subject so they'd have to tell the real story. We had a lot of tools available to us that we didn't use because we are lazy and selfish. BTW, if you want to follow the power, don't look at what governments do, look at what the other oligarchs do. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.</description>

As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He'll probably do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com. Goodbye Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubye. Not sure if moving your DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He's taking advantage of centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally centralized. A journalist couldn't report this, because what proof do I have? It's because there's a pattern here. And it's pretty obvious the tools he's using.</description>

			<description>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22&quot;&gt;Suggested User List&lt;/a&gt; that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course &lt;i&gt;publicly owned&lt;/i&gt; now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.</description>

			<title>It's as if we got cancer</title>

You hope the cancer doesn't kill you, and swear to never smoke again if you're lucky enough to survive it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time, when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start trying to get their attention, which hasn't happened yet, it's going to be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis isn't good. But we should get our shit together asap because it's our only hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.</description>

			<description>I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy.</description>

			<source:outline text="I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy." created="Sun, 02 Feb 2025 19:58:52 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/02/02.html#a195852"/>

			<description>Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner&quot;&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this, say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</description>

			<description>Even if Congress doesn't do anything to rein in Musk and Trump, the stock market will have something to say on Monday, one assumes. And this might be one time to hope for a market crash.</description>

			<description>I rewrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oursocialweb.org/&quot;&gt;oursocialweb.org&lt;/a&gt; home page. It needed to focus on linking. The term web is being thrown around too casually, without regard to what the web is, the same kind of dilution that's happening with podcasting. But the &lt;i&gt;social web&lt;/i&gt; idea is fairly new, and it's really important that we get this right.</description>

Will there be any tech companies that aren't wholly owned by Musk, Inc. Will owning things even mean anything? Or is this the beginning of the rule of the tech bros, world wide. I can't imagine what they're planning for us. In the meantime, me divesting my Tesla, which seemed so urgent just 24 hours ago, now seems like a powerless gesture. I heard it said that now feels like the moment in Covid when you realized everything was about to freeze, and you'd better head to the supermarket right now, and when you got there, you found you weren't among the first to see it this way. I was very reassured by the blog post that Krugman did. It's nice to hear a sane voice out there.</description>

			<description>Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/01.opml&quot;&gt;month&lt;/a&gt;, starting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml/2025&quot;&gt;new year&lt;/a&gt; in the archive on GitHub. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml/2024&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt; is complete. We've been following this pattern long enough. I wish GitHub had existed in 1994, and I wish we understood how to use it sooner than we did. Onward!</description>
