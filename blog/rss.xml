			<description>Goldberg said they are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/797774d7-4770-46b8-863d-b7c62da4261c&quot;&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, they're journalists. Well then my question is what good are you exactly and why are you using up all the airtime? Why is NPR even bothering to interview you. He said it clearly, he was just trying to save his conscience for after the Nazis came to power in the US. We have bigger issues than Jeffrey Goldberg's conscience. Why doesn't NPR and The Atlantic go out and find The Freaking Resistance and introduce us to them. My grandfather said something to me when I was a little boy, with such clarity, I can never forget it. He said David, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you need to go up on the roof with a gun, and shoot them. He knew. He didn't say &quot;David, run&quot; or &quot;David, write an article in The Atlantic so you have a clear conscience.&quot; He said I should fight. With guns. That was the lesson he learned from his experience. So where is our Resistance? What the F are we waiting for?</description>

It was a very zen-like mystical idea, and imho totally wrong. And it's still repeated as if it were gospel -- it's a typical response when I beg for a standard that is more realistic, that incorporates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;basic features of web writing&lt;/a&gt;: simple styles, links, optional titles, enclosures, the ability to edit and unlimited length. The fallacy of this response is that you are free to write however you want, if you feel your ideas are better communicated in short messages, go ahead. I want to use all the tools in my writing. And if you don't want to read all that I write or any of it, there are tools that make that easy. So everyone wins, and you don't have to try to impose your ideas of religiously pure writing on anyone but yourself.</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary&quot;&gt;corrollary&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; philosophy is that I should be able to use any writing tool I like to post to the web, and have it flow where ever I want. The idea of being forced to use a teeny little edit box to write my wonderful prose is as silly as bunding a word processor with a printer, and forcing you to use that editor if you want to print it with that printer. If I sent you a document written for my Brand X printer but you had Brand Y, sorry -- you can't read it. I'm at the point in my life where I have to explain to young folk how great things were when I was their age, but it's true in this case, when I was in my 20s and 30s, there were simple standards for text, and you could print documents produced by any writing tool on any printer. And as a result a wide variety of writing tools and editors were available, and there was lots of innovation in a very short period of time because everyone had competition they could learn from and had to keep up with. Now there's no reason for Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, Bluesky, Mastodon or whatever to improve their editors because after all you don't have any choice. That's another important facet of textcasting that we borrow from podcasting -- lots of ways to create and lots of ways to listen mean things &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; get better. With lock-in, they can't.</description>

			<title>Why we want feeds in Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My old friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22chuck+shotton%22&quot;&gt;Chuck Shotton&lt;/a&gt; just &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social&quot;&gt;showed up&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love Chuck. We've been through a lot together over a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had a ton of fun in the early days of the web on the Mac. Chuck wrote the HTTP server we all used. And he loved Frontier, so we made our products work incredibly well together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Those were the days! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, of course I immediately followed Chuck in Bluesky, but then I realize, I can also follow him &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Amrwheat.bsky.social&quot;&gt;in FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; because thanks to John Spurlock, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:mrwheat.bsky.social&quot;&gt;we have feeds&lt;/a&gt; for every freaking Bluesky user. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock&quot;&gt;Spurlock&lt;/a&gt; is a gifted programmer, like Chuck, who thinks creatively and doesn't mind priming the pump of a bootstrap, something Chuck and I have done many times in the past. (Chuck is an largely uncredited contributor to the bootstraps of RSS, XML-RPC, podcasting, object databases, content management systems, hey pretty much everything I've worked on since 1994 or so.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now I get to the point. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to build with confidence on the feed connection with Bluesky. Today I know the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;Bluesky RSS 2.0 feed&lt;/a&gt; is there, but will it be there in the future? I would feel better if the feed support were built-into Bluesky, part of its basic feature set. Another very simple API that gets ideas out of Bluesky and anywhere feeds go, which is, as you know, everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Feeds should be the baseline of compatibility between social media platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Working with Spurlock, we have given Bluesky a huge headstart, a lead in what I hope will be a race to feed support in all the social media apps, to hook them up to the worldwide feed bus. It's a way to get interop without having to concede that any comprehensive API is the winner. Think of RSS 2.0 support at the TCP of social networking, offering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator&quot;&gt;LCD&lt;/a&gt; compatibility to a world that desperately needs one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then after we have that, we can talk about the format of the data we're sending over this network. We have some work to do there too, but luckily the capabilities and limits of RSS 2.0 are a perfect match here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the reason we want it is so we can do more with confidence with Bluesky, integrate it into more systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason the Bluesky people should want it is that it offers a way to interop with all social nets, that will take almost no effort on their part, and there's no guesswork, we already know how to make feeds that will work pretty much everywhere, and it lets them take the lead in what will be an important way to communicate on the net. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the reason it's good for all of us is we can start viewing the web once again as a fully supported writing environment, and let the writers of the world get to work on solving all our problems (of which we have many) and get the freaking technology out of their way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the feed-iverse, it's easier and more low-level than the fed-iverse, and can be implemented in a weekend. And it's fun! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've never gotten it in two, and I don't usually try, and when I do it's usually a mistake, I would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third round.

			<title>Doc &amp; FeedLand &amp; artcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I pinged Doc the other day saying he should do an artcasting feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doc is in addition to being a prodigious blogger, also is a photo taker and story teller, so he is perfect for artcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/07/29/doc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was then going to think about what would be the easiest way to get him going, and quickly realized the fastest way is Bluesky because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock&quot;&gt;John Spurlock&lt;/a&gt; did it right and his feeds coming out of Bluesky are totally artcasting-compatible.

			<description>You can live in places where people do awful disgusting things, I know, I've lived in New Orleans, Berkeley and NYC. Twitter is so huge, this idea that it could disband just like that, well it isn't happening. Maybe it's time for us to say clearly what we expect of a social network and try to influence how they run them. We have these great tools for organizing, one of these days we're going to use them for good, in a serious way. And at this point the users have a lot of power relative to what we've had in the past.</description>

			<description>If I could devote myself fulltime to AI development, first thing I'd do is teach a bot how to generate CSS with high level commands from me. After 15 years of wrangling CSS, I still create messes that are impossible to unravel, the only way to fix it is to start over, and then that gets out of control, and on and on. It would take some patience to establish some basic design patterns, but once designed I could say things like &quot;a little less margin on top of the tabs&quot; and boom that would happen.</description>

We can do a lot if we work together." created="Fri, 01 Dec 2023 17:08:40 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/12/indianaJones.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/01.html#a170840"/>

			<description>Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/786af3a9-c35c-499f-8e97-f4b7017415ab&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;? It fell off the air when Twitter blew up their API. I keep wanting it back, because I keep watching shows that should be in its database. I miss it. Then I realized it's not that different from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot;&gt;group of explorers&lt;/a&gt; who are putting their app choices into feeds. The Bingeworthy database is people, shows and ratings. The simplest relational database possible. It would be easy to represent each user as a feed, where each item is a rating. The link for each item would be a pointer to the Metacritic page. And then give each feed a category of &lt;i&gt;bingeworthy. &lt;/i&gt;From there, we explore.  BTW, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/a5b3ac43939954c4af6759a9ce27989f&quot;&gt;SQL code&lt;/a&gt; that creates the BW database.</description>
