If you think it was great, you should watch it again. They got everything wrong, imho -- and the storytelling is as simple as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html&quot;&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/a&gt;. If you loved it in 2012, okay -- but we've all been through hell since then. And we know how the news orgs The Newsroom was trying to model dealt with the challenge. They folded. They gave up. It's all bullshit. It's like watching the story of a great war, that we lost. I don't mean bloggers, I mean all of it. If democracy depends on journalism, then it's gone. It can't come back from what they're doing now. Think of the hair-splitting they did in The Newsroom, even the slightest appearance of impropriety. Now they invite politicians on when they know they're going to tell hugely damaging lies about very important things. They're doing the opposite of what journalism is supposed to do. They sure as hell don't care what we think of them. Go watch it again. It's a time capsule that will show you how much you've learned since those horribly naive days. Maybe I'll write more about this tomorrow.</description>

			<description>I've never written a review on Amazon even though I shop there regularly. I was about to write a negative review for a product they can't seem to support, that I depend on, but got &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/05/amazonReviewPage.png&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt;. Weird. I bought the product from the page I wanted to review it on. How else would they determine if I actually purchased the product? They don't say. They do offer to tell me a joke if I rate products I've bought. I've heard the company isn't doing that well now that Bezos has stepped aside. Hopefully this is just a bad set of coincidences.</description>

			<description>I'm watching the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; from 2012, it's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin&quot;&gt;Aaron Sorkin&lt;/a&gt; show. It's fairly insipid, but for some reason I keep watching. They have a multi-episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Newsroom_episodes#Season_2_(2013)&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; as they go crazy trying to source a rumor they've heard that the US bombed a town in the Middle East with sarin gas, and killed a lot of people. In other words they committed a war crime. Turns out they were set up by multiple people, and they went through all kinds of angst over who should resign and who should be fired, and how they would ever regain the trust of the viewers. It is a Sorkin thing so it is by definition overdone, but in the context of today's NYT and CNN and all the other schlock &quot;news&quot; that reports Trump's ever-more-egrious lies not only without fact checking, but knowing for sure the lies are coming. That this has happened to American &quot;journalism&quot; is worse than a war crime. It's what everyone told us is an essential part of an authoritarian state, we expect everything in the news to be lies. We have now gotten there. It's good to acknowledge that, imho and stop asking why it is, rather think about &lt;i&gt;what you can do&lt;/i&gt; about it.</description>

			<title>Funny story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to &quot;colorize&quot; the first picture. The second picture is what it produced. Note I didn't say &quot;editorialize.&quot; I don't know what you think but I think it's art! (I'm serious, I'll write more about that. I love that it's making us define art.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/04/blackAndWhite.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The first picture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/04/colorized.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The second picture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I did mention Ben Hammersley. So he's not out of the story, but he's not the person who gave podcasting its name. September 2004 was the moment when podcasting became something. It's rare in things like this that you can point to a moment, but we can &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the record should make that very clear. You could say Hammersley was the first to publish the term in a piece he wrote, but he played no role in the bootstrap. I'd say that by the end of 2004 it was on its way, I basically stepped back and enjoyed the medium along with everyone else. Adam started a company. I would have liked to have started a company then, but it wasn't meant to be. That all happened 20 years ago.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/09.html&quot;&gt;September 2004&lt;/a&gt; was the month when podcasting became a real community thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html&quot;&gt;Twenty years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;podcasting got its name&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them &quot;audio blog posts&quot; or some variant thereof. You can see it in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast&quot;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; graph. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;special feed&lt;/a&gt; to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298&quot;&gt;Apple's podcast&lt;/a&gt; database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. &lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<title>Bluesky vs Mastodon as open APIs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Neither one is in a particularly strong position. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like &quot;fediverse&quot; get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working &lt;i&gt;together. &lt;/i&gt;It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The networks should put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C_YWpfXNZq_&quot;&gt;Trump on time delay&lt;/a&gt; and when he says you can legally murder babies in some states, that should be treated as if he said fuck or shit. Put up a screen that explains why he was cut off, then go to commercial, esp during the debate on Sep 10.</description>

They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a &quot;market of one&quot; and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder, I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the success of the company.</description>

			<description>Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook&quot;&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>And for some companies, the founder of a company they acquire might make the best CEO when the founder of the original company isn't available. Again Apple is a great example. Steve Jobs ultimately replaced Gil Amelio, after Apple bought NeXT.</description>
