			<description>We're at a huge fork in the road. One fork -- goodbye USA, the other way, we're stronger than ever. We're in a good spot because Trump's tank is empty. He's old, tired, fat, addled, fetid, rotten. You have to work really hard not to see that. If it works, Biden will have stabilized the country, and Harris will erect the guardrails that make sure no one follows in Trump's path, and the Supreme Court gets back into its proper place. They've been overthrowing our society, economy and political system. That all has to be reversed before it does too much damage, and prevented in the future. I want to know why the court can't be expanded, and if Harris will put that in her platform.</description>

			<description>It's weird that JD Vance goes out with the insults before most people have any idea who he is. Instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3pz2pz8no&quot;&gt;childless cat ladies&lt;/a&gt; sticking to Kamala, it's sticking to him, which I'm pretty sure wasn't his intent.</description>

			<description>Pretty remarkable how abusive the bots on Twitter have become. Makes discourse there seem pretty silly. Might as well turn it into a one-way medium, for all practical purposes that's what it is.</description>

			<description>I want a Masto-clone that does not do replies. You can't insert anything under my idea, but you can if you like include my idea, as a link, in yours. This model works. I think by now we know the other way does not work. BTW I use the term Masto-clone interchangeably with Twitter-like. Let's spread the love around.</description>

			<description>Software-wise I realized recently that everything that takes me away from creating really nice writing and publishing tools is a waste. I have to get off track because there are huge holes in the web as a runtime platform. And every year it gets worse as new incompatible languages are added, new incompatible stacks built. As a result we have to re-do everything all the time, and never get a chance to create new user experience. The market fragments, which is exactly what the tech companies want. It keeps their products from becoming commodities. And like it or not, the politicians and corporations don't want us writing too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about things they don't care about.</description>

			<description>Fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/live/harris-biden-trump-election-campaign-updates&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; by President Biden. It's good we'll have both a president and a campaign and that they'll be separate thing. I look forward to reading it slowly. And he put a cap on the awful communication of the last month, he took control of the story from the snobs and shit throwers in the press.</description>

This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lover-elon-musk-already-145940678.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; says that Musk is rate-limiting followers on that account.  Of course we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; what could happen if a Republican bought twitter, but I didn't honestly contemplate that a fascist would. These days our greatest fears aren't scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh. BTW, if you want to know why we're so thrilled to have Harris as the candidate, even though we didn't want Joe to give in, it's because no informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it). Today it's the hope that we won't be deported or worse.</description>

			<description>All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem what they have to say about that. But the reporter &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; what the Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don't care if we know.</description>

So the first thing the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem what they have to say about that. But the reporter &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; what the Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are.

			<title>Podcast starts with linkblogging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what we put on the wire over the social web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from algol-like and lisp-like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I talk about what made Unix so great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eric Raymond once told me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and the rest. Huge compliment because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the big picture. We shouldn't give them so much power, they pretend they know, but they are usually pretty clueless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours every day, and string those days together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt. Those are the hardest projects, I'm doing one of those right now, but in the end it's worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I'm from Queens too</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the same part of Queens as Trump, about ten years after he did. His family was in Jamaica, mine in Flushing. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/2931+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/85-15+Wareham+Pl,+Jamaica,+NY+11432/@40.74413,-73.7982607,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2611ad4d2c6a5:0xfe60c1b9262c3e04!2m2!1d-73.7858048!2d40.7170409!3e0?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway&quot;&gt;Utopia Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. A great name for a street, but it's not a parkway and it's nice but definitely not a utopia.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who aren't from huge cities like New York don't know that Trump what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I think that's where 99% of the confusion is. They really don't believe he's so bad. Don't hold that against them, that's nowhere near as bad as knowing what he is and being okay with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don't believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming&quot;&gt;body shaming&lt;/a&gt;, because I care about other people's feelings. If I criticize his appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type who may not be mean bully losers like Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's also a really good comedian if you don't think he wants to have the power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that's the mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole that would have been hard to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt, and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don't like a candidate vote against them don't shoot them. That's American and it's not fascist at all. I don't think they know that he wants to make big changes in how our politics work. People think if he's bad they can just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn't seem to register. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Do Trump supporters understand what they support?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump's followers are deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6 and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They're already doing it via the Supreme Court. It's going to get a lot worse if we go the wrong way. We shouldn't accept that we're horribly divided. The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don't know why and I don't care, I just know they do, based on their actions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I know we're at a high moment, we're excited, and I'm going to enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on &quot;our side&quot; but I hold out hope that being an American still means something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work together. I think that's still our greatest challange and our greatest opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think most of us do no matter who you vote for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bidens-exit-puts-the-spotlight-on-the-dnc-delegates&quot;&gt;The earth shook today&lt;/a&gt;. I'm watching the news like everyone else after President Biden withdrew.

Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the money they've accumulated.

			<title>Dreaming of the super-Democrat</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some coffee notes for a Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This election is a total mess.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump is extremely beatable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden is extremely beatable too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've all had a chance to live in an America with Trump as president, and Biden. I know which one was better for all of us. (Evidence: our response to Covid, S&amp;P 500 price.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden's health is not good and it of course will get worse in the coming four years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump's health isn't good either and it also will get worse. He doesn't care for himself. He's 77. He's near the end of the decade most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-live-longer-for-men-2223908#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20the%20average,%2D19%20infection%2C%20and%20stroke.&quot;&gt;people die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Dems can run the show without Biden.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Repubs plan to run the show without Trump, he's just a figurehead, I hope you know that. An actor they put on stage to distract you from the nasty shit they are already doing (evidence, the Supreme Court). When he says Project 2025 isn't his, he's telling the truth. He has no idea what's in it and doesn't care. All he wants is to stand up at rallies and vent, and have his own Rick's Cafe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)&quot;&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; and be Rick. It's the quieter, less showy folk that use him that you should be scared of. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even if Biden wanted to step aside, and he clearly doesn't, the mess that would follow can't be unraveled before the election, so if you push Biden out we lose, pretty sure of that. This is why I think Nate Silver lost his way, he's a sports fan, as am I. What's your next move after taking out the pitcher. You better have a good reliever warmed up in the bullpen, right? We don't even have a freaking bullpen Nate (hope he reads this). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But it's fun to dream of the super-Democrat, the candidate who would totally clean Trump's clock, win in a landslide, and when they take office would clear out the junk on the Supreme Court, bring back Roe v Wade, slam the brakes on climate change, and then kick Putin's ass and restore America to greatness for real, and also prepare us to survive the next pandemic. But it's just a dream. It can't happen. Any good candidate will stay out of the mess that will follow a Biden step-aside. No one would want their future tied up in the mess-to-come. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember, your vote is a chess move not a love letter. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/20/rickstanding.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Plot&quot;&gt;Rick Blaine&lt;/a&gt; owns a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The first half is an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries&quot;&gt;Hakeem Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;, you can skip that part, pretty standard stuff. It gets interesting at 17:50 when they take calls from listeners. A lot of different points of view from people of all ages, they're incredibly passionate, well thought-out, coherent. This is way better than the punditry you hear on news. The real crime here is that the insiders of the Democratic Party are taking control, after they were manipulated by the press. A total insider's route-around of the democratic process, it's just as bad imho as what the Repubs are planning around Election Day. The press did the same thing to NY governor Andrew Cuomo, who was elected by the people, and forced out without any legal process, and certainly not a vote. That experience argues in favor of when you're in doubt, do the thing the voters said to do. Anything else is very very questionable. Why are you taking control? Where are you authorized to do that? I think perhaps some of the Dems forget how huge an issue this was in the 2016 process.</description>

			<description>Historically it's unjustifiable. The NYT et al are grievously wrong, and that should be reflected on their op-ed pages. We've been here before, this is as much a hack as Hillary's Emails. Maybe you can't see it now, but win or lose, people are going to look at this period when we all lost our minds.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2024/07/6-6/&quot;&gt;Matt says&lt;/a&gt; some interesting new stuff is coming from Automattic now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2024/07/dorsey/&quot;&gt;WordPress 6.6&lt;/a&gt; is out. Something for writers? Perhaps something that moves WordPress into a space adjacent to twitter-like systems? They just added support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; to WordPress, so now you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://jetpack.com/social/&quot;&gt;crosspost&lt;/a&gt; from a blog to a thread. Haven't tried it yet. They also have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/&quot;&gt;identity system&lt;/a&gt; built around Gravatar, announced in early June. It'll be interesting to see what they come out with. I wonder if there is a developer ecosystem building on this, and if they have an evangelism program. I have my own vision of how these things should work.</description>

			<description>The Repubs can win by throwing the election into the House. They can probably get it by the courts in enough places, just a couple of swing states, and they win even if they lose by normal vote-counting methods. The whole bit about Biden's age is meant to distract us from the fact it probably doesn't matter how old the Democratic candidate is.</description>

			<description>Highly recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81614129&quot;&gt;Netflix series&lt;/a&gt; -- esp the last three episodes. I found it enlightening, even though I lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. &quot;The end of history&quot; was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the USA, and the deep and lasting wounds we keep re-opening.</description>

He's as empty as Trump, and much younger, so we can't hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem, because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump's sons probably aren't happy about this. Had he picked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio&quot;&gt;Little Marco&lt;/a&gt;, no one would mistake him as an heir, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum&quot;&gt;Doug Burgum&lt;/a&gt; who is a bit too old to be an heir (same age as I am). We &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have a problem with Biden, he hasn't prepared for this moment. Old or not, they had 3.5 years to get ready, and they didn't. As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest most important thing is that we &lt;b&gt;organize ourselves.&lt;/b&gt; That's the best defense all around. Every attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)&quot;&gt;corral&lt;/a&gt; the insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate. Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he was getting there, but now he's back, and probably a bigger threat than ever. I don't think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need leadership. Not wait to be led. We've waited too long. People who appear ready to step up -- AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn't put Obama on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being nice, unfortunately. We're also not going to prevail by each of us taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.</description>
