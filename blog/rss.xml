			<description>I'm working my way through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-bear/season-4/&quot;&gt;The Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and it's great because you remember that you love all these characters and you can immediately start living the ongoing drama of their lives. I feel like a cat perched on a window watching everyone doing their daily stuff. Looking forward to going back to the beginning and starting over.</description>

			<description>BTW, I think the right way to read Scripting News is getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. That's the pulse. I jot stuff down during the day, mostly in the morning, and later add links and finish stuff up. The scripting.com feed is updated in realtime. So you may get many versions of an item over the day, which might be a problem with feed readers that don't watch for changes. I noticed that my changes to a recent podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html&quot;&gt;shownotes page&lt;/a&gt; don't flow back out to my podcast client app on Android. &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; btw, records changes, and they flow through to the timeline. Coupled with &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;, which is supported in every WordPress site, makes the whole thing realtime. People assume that feeds have to perform like a feed reader. But if you have a component running on the open internet, hooked up via websockets to the client, you get the flow they get in twitter-like systems. And we didn't have to invent anything that didn't already exist in 2009.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/mamdani-and-the-moguls-of-madness&quot;&gt;Krugman&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t understand what’s coming for NYC. And doesn’t understand the leadership &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; uniquely provided at the height of Covid. It’s pretty likely what’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg430dx702o&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; in NYC will be worse than Covid or 9-11. Funny thing is Krugman &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; get it, a few weeks ago when the crisis in Los Angeles was peaking. He wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/this-is-not-a-drill&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that was terrified, and realistic. The National Guard had been nationalized. Marines were invading California. But now that Calif hasn't been in the news, it's easy to swing back. I bet if the election had happened during the worst of it, Cuomo would've won.</description>

Here's what I say. Forget about ever rising from the ashes of what remains of the party. Right now, the issue is how to defend the city from the coming war with the US government. They're already holding the current mayor hostage. This will be worse than 9-11 and Covid. We have no leadership. We're totally fucked, what the Democratic Party does or doesn't do, at this point, simply doesn't matter.</description>

When I clicked on the link, I was surprised that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/trump-says-fudge-vulgarity-news/&quot;&gt;goes to Poynter&lt;/a&gt;, and not to the linkblog. But then I remembered that's the point of a linkblog. And it flows through to the feed, and the blogroll software understands. So now I have an end-to-end linkblog.</description>

			<description>Another reason to love WordPress. Every freaking WordPress site had &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/support/feeds/&quot;&gt;great RSS support&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Finding Frontier</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I tried an experiment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/asfarasyoucango.png&quot;&gt;go back&lt;/a&gt; as far as I can in archive.org on scripting.com and see where it gets me. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19961114163115/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;first try&lt;/a&gt; got me to a classified ads site I was experimenting with in mid-November 1996. A few weeks later, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224609/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;December 3,&lt;/a&gt; there was a colorful directory that took you to all the sub-sites on the server, DaveNet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, Classified ads, our Midas Website (Macintosh Internet Developers Association), DocServer, a BBS, and Guestbook.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went digging around in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224624/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; part. Lots of stuff there. By then we had been working on Frontier for eight years. It had been reborn once, from a Mac-focused single-user scripting environment to a networked one, all because the web had exploded and Apple didn't want us making system software for their platform. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, some of this stuff is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html&quot;&gt;still here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of paths to try out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was where my &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224710/http://www.scripting.com/frontier/news.html&quot;&gt;blog home page&lt;/a&gt; was then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then to DaveNet, and in the left margin &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19961203224727/http://www.scripting.com/davenet/aboutthiswebsite.html&quot;&gt;Nerd's guide to this website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love the screen shots that show what a good match the Frontier object database was to the way a website is organized.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/25/frontierScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;user.websites.davenet&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's one of the basic rules of the web, it's an unchanging thing, no one can break it because everyone is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;guest&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>One more thing about the linkblog, it no longer cross-posts to social media sites. I want to see if I miss having the links there. It also won't have the limits. Maybe it'll be better if my accounts are a bit more quiet. Also the RSS feed is in a new location, I want to wait a bit to make sure it works before publicizing the URL.</description>

			<title>WordCamp Canada in October</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm keynoting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Canada&lt;/a&gt; conference in October in Ottawa. It's the first conference I've attended since before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The timing is ideal, and the location is significant. As an American, I don't want to try to attract people from around the world to a meeting in my country. Right now, I wouldn't come here if I didn't live here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm also not happy with the tech industry of the US. I'd like a fresh start, a return to our roots, with the assumption that the people control their destiny and the role of developers is to give them to the tools to try out new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; I've created a product &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/&quot;&gt;for writers&lt;/a&gt;, filling a need that's been there since the beginning of the web, using the practices in writing tools we learned in the 80s. It doesn't have the artificial &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;limits&lt;/a&gt; imposed by Twitter et al. I think they're senseless. So we're going to blow that door wide open. No character limits. Simple styling. Links. Editable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And it's also a product for developers. There's no lock-in anywhere in this stack. So you can make a different style of editor. Or play with new ways to view timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take discourse in a different direction too. A good design for the social web shouldn't require intense moderation. The reward for spammers is practically nil. Also, it'll be good for small groups in a way that Twitter et al never have been. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far I haven't invented any new formats. We're building on what works now. WordPress is a remarkably deep product, so deep it could be used as operating system. and that's exactly how I've chosen to view it and it works incredibly well. Some of what we're building on is based on work I did with Joseph Scott of Automattic in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22joseph%20scott%22&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, believe it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And as a bonus we get a great bridge into ActivityPub, from the great work Automattic is doing in bridging WordPress to ActivityPub. Think about it and you'll see how connections in and out of WordPress can facilitate a lot of interop, not just via RSS, but any format that comes along that people want to use.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We'll have a lot to talk about in October! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>RSS on a timeline</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;More on the vision for WordLand and RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; is the editor of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22twitter-like%22&quot;&gt;twitter-like&lt;/a&gt; system built around &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. It saves your writing to WordPress, where it is published on a website and via RSS. You don't have to use WordLand or WordPress, because RSS is an open format. &lt;i&gt;Any editor that generates RSS is part of the network. &lt;/i&gt;Designed to be simple. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that's missing is a timeline viewer, and that's what I'm working on now. It's coming together pretty nicely, imho. Not an easy project, though on the surface it looks like it should be. Also there's nothing proprietary about my timeline viewer. There could be a thousand of them. Anyone who has written an RSS feed reader will have all the low-level bits they need. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hoping to have all the connections working by the end of the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once done, it will be the completion of the vision for RSS as the foundation of the open social web, the place that all the open formats agree on, so we can get on with interop and say goodbye to lock-in. It can be done, I'm almost 100 percent sure of that now. Still have a little ways to go. As they say -- &lt;i&gt;still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just a guess, but the people doing the &quot;ice&quot; raids are not real police any more than the &quot;doge&quot; people are/were actually part of the US government. In this New Yorker &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-rise-and-fall-of-doge&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, they dug into what &quot;doge&quot; actually was/is. Some weren't actually Trump supporters, they just thought it would be interesting to be empowered to fix the government. They learned the government doesn't work the way they thought it did. Spending is way up over the years, but number of government employees has stayed flat. It has already been largely privatized. Tangentially they appear to have found some things actually worth fixing. Tech culture isn't just the billionaires, far from it. There's a lot of hippie ethics in there too, you just have to look past the money, which seems too much work for some/most journalists. But The New Yorker tends to do this well, btw, sometimes. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

For me it was like someone who built applications of electricity, going back to see Edison's workbench before there was an industry. It was so seminal. It would never work in today's architectures, almost everything was global. There were five color constants, white, black, gray, ltGray, dkGray. You could see the whole archtecture in just a few pages. It wasn't bloated yet. And the best thing was &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/20/globals.png&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; was the screen memory. Not hidden. If you didn't like the way &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/06/19/152802.html&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt; worked, you could go around it. It was an idea I only ever used on the Apple II, it was imho Woz's big contribution, for me coming from Unix it was incredible to have so much power. On the Mac it showed up as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/20/globals.png&quot;&gt;variable&lt;/a&gt; in a high level language, on the Apple II, you had to know the physical address, but in both cases, when you stored a bit in the memory it showed up on the screen. We never saw anything like that on the previous generation of machines, IBM mainframes and Digital minis. Someday someone will go through all this and see how it evolved. These &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/misc/quickdrawApiSummary.pdf&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt; are a tiny but hugely significant slice. Maybe with next year's ChatGPT.</description>

			<description>I had an experience like the one Paul Simon described on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmP3rzBeXkw&quot;&gt;Colbert last night&lt;/a&gt;. I was at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/retail/west14thstreet/&quot;&gt;Apple Store on 14th St&lt;/a&gt; in NYC to pick up a new phone I had pre-ordered, lined up with some much younger folks who asked if I knew what was new on the phone. I said I wasn’t sure, so I asked if they knew. They all agreed the coolest thing was called “pod casting.” They said it slowly to be sure I could understand. They said it was great, it was like radio, but you could get it from the web, and there was always lots of new stuff. &quot;What will they think of next,&quot; said the old man, impressed, nodding with respect.</description>

			<title>Bill Atkinson and QuickDraw</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson&quot;&gt;Bill Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; died two weeks ago today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was explaining to a friend why he was so important. Most people who know of him know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint&quot;&gt;MacPaint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard&quot;&gt;Hypercard&lt;/a&gt;, both were fantastic contributions to the evolution of personal computers. But underneath all that he created a layer of the Macintosh OS called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;, which was a core innovation of the Mac, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;graphic system&lt;/a&gt;. Every piece of software that ran on the Macintosh ran on top of QuickDraw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what QuickDraw is. Software could do things at the pixel level, a dot so small it's barely visible to the eye. What you're seeing on the screen is made up of collections of those dots, forming lines, boxes, ovals and text, and later page layouts, beautiful photography, and the text you're reading right now. The software that does all that, on the earliest Macs, is called QuickDraw. (Later a successor called Quick&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; made the dots move and added sound, and now we have streaming.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;QuickDraw is great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the thing. You could tell from the API that the designers really understood the tech. It wasn't the first time this had been done. And either Atkinson did it himself, working on it for years, or he &quot;stole from the best&quot; -- probably a lot of both. The prior art came from Xerox in Palo Alto, and the experience came from being a hard-working dedicated hacker who didn't give up until it was done. That's like saying if he were a basketball hero, he was like Bill Russell or Steph Curry. We don't talk about our accomplishments that much in tech, on a personal level, we have an idea that Steve Jobs made the Mac, but it was really created by developers, designers, graphic artists, writers and application developers.  Like Bill Atkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I spent many years building on his work, and many more years wishing I still was. He made a contribution, and that's, imho, pretty much the best you can say for any person's life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Bill. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/19/billAtkinson.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Bill Atkinson, on his creation, MacPaint on QuickDraw on Mac.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: For programmers, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/misc/quickdrawApiSummary.pdf&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of the QuickDraw API.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Here's what QuickDraw is. Software could do things at the pixel level, a dot so small it's barely visible to the eye. What you're seeing on the screen is made up of collections of those dots, forming lines, boxes, ovals and text, and later page layouts, beautiful photography, and the text you're reading right now. The software that does all that, on the earliest Macs, is called QuickDraw. (Later a successor called Quick&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; made the dots move and added sound, and now we have streaming.)" created="Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:29:49 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2025/06/19/152802.html#a152949"/>

				<source:outline text="That's the thing. You could tell from the API that the designers really understood the tech. It wasn't the first time this had been done. And either Atkinson did it himself, working on it for years, or he &quot;stole from the best&quot; -- probably a lot of both. The prior art came from Xerox in Palo Alto, and the experience came from being a hard-working dedicated hacker who didn't give up until it was done. That's like saying if he were a basketball hero, he was like Bill Russell or Steph Curry. We don't talk about our accomplishments that much in tech, on a personal level, we have an idea that Steve Jobs made the Mac, but it was really created by developers, designers, graphic artists, writers and application developers.

			<title>Passkeys and ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/emilynussbaum.bsky.social/post/3lrt3iyw5ic2j&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; with a writer saying she didn't have much use for ChatGPT, though she had tried it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if I could open a door, suggesting that next time there was an problem using a computer, that she bring the question to ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think that's good advice for anyone who hasn't seen how useful these are as tools. You can use it like a search engine. What comes back answers your question. With Google you'd have to read through docs that are meant to cover every angle, but the AI bot zeroes in on the issue you're dealing with. And the writing on ChatGPT is better than what you would get on a random web page explaining a technical concept. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passkeys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Previously I had tried to approach passkeys to get an idea of how I should use them, but never grasped the big picture. I just didn't understand what they were doing, but I understood it was about authentication. A hardware approach to identity, that much I got. How it worked and how I would use it did not click. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then earlier this week, an essential site that I use infrequently, required using a passkey. When I had set it up a few months ago, as part of a bigger develolpment task,  I had no idea what I was doing, and eventually bailed out, and left it unable to get back into the system, which happened on Sunday. By default the browser, Chrome, had previously connected it to my Pixel 9 Pro. There was a record of the connection being used for a variety of other services, but the one I needed was not there. This was after a full day of trying to debug it from the other side. I now have a lot more info about how passkeys work, I won't be able to say I know enough until I've re-established the connection. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of readers of this site understood passkeys without anyone having to piece it together for them. I have never been one of those people. Just the way my mind works, it's why I'm a good person to test software, I get lost easily. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All this is to say -- think of ChatGPT as a technical assistant with broad knowledge and patience. That's where the real power is imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

So the Unisphere from the last World's Fair will have to do. But Queens is probably the most ethnically diverse place in the world. Think about that for a minute and how the fight for the soul of the US will be fought in Queens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I come from Jackson Heights and Flushing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I bet there were plans hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I was also surprised there weren't any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday's parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump, rather it's TV President &quot;Taco&quot; Trump. I think they had a plan and he lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That's a line that hadn't yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It's here.</description>

			<title>Some media is for relaxation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/machoGeneralTaco.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;BTW, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/opinion/obama-save-america-trump.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/joerogue.png&quot;&gt;bit of wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that I had not considered because I don't listen to Joe Rogan it would never occur to me. He's relaxing white noise, chatting in the background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode of media consumption. I'm always on the hunt for that kind of content. That's why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out, knowing they'll replay the best stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds of a meeting we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman&quot;&gt;Berkman&lt;/a&gt; in the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened public radio (didn't turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good use of podcasting). One of the guys from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prx.org/&quot;&gt;PRX&lt;/a&gt; which was also incubating there at the time, said at me in a challenging way -- You get the best info from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a good question. No, I said, it's relaxing, I can tune out while I'm driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it's so true. Now it's great when there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; that really &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief&quot;&gt;catches&lt;/a&gt; your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There must be a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that's when you really have to start worrying! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually.

				<source:outline text="Reminds of a meeting we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman&quot;&gt;Berkman&lt;/a&gt; in the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened public radio (didn't turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good use of podcasting). One of the guys from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prx.org/&quot;&gt;PRX&lt;/a&gt; which was also incubating there at the time, said at me in a challenging way -- You get the best info from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a good question. No, I said, it's relaxing, I can tune out while I'm driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it's so true. Now it's great when there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; that really &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief&quot;&gt;catches&lt;/a&gt; your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is with white noise, background relaxation.

It could cure the revulsion some voters feel for Democratic wokeness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; was never tried or convicted of any crime, or voted out of office by the state assembly or senate in Albany. Or the people of the State of New York. Al Franken wasn't allowed to have his case adjudicated by a committee of Congress. Both were pushed from office by journalism, which imho needs to be put in their place, they've been sloshing into lanes they weren't elected to. Let me try to make this clear. Journalism's role is to inform us of events. Once informed, it's their responsibility to stop. Anything past that is campaigning, not news. Step back and let the process run its course. Ultimately it's the people who will decide. Now, if Cuomo wins, this is the best outcome possible because the NYT et al will complain endlessly about how the Democrats just elected someone who they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gi9zFRBCIM&quot;&gt;don't approve of&lt;/a&gt;. This will probably get the Dems more votes in coming elections, because there are a lot of people who legitimately are disgusted by the NYT trying to run the show. If you want to govern, run for office. If you want to be a journalist, know when it's time to shut up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW isn't it amazing that when you say something counter to Democratic dogma, their first impulse is to try to destroy you? If the Dems were a healthy political party and not a religion, their first impulse would be to try to work with you not destroy you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who me?&quot; asks the Democrat. Yes, you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll know who the next leader of the Democratic Party is because they will be campaigning against the Democratic Party. Talking about things that actually happened rather than the hallucinations the Trumpies indulge in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today I'm going to teach &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; how to manage a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=linkblog&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt;. Before doing that I tried to figure out what a linkblog is. I have been using various homebrew linkblogging tools which I have shared with others, but none of them became popular products. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/linkblog/&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; to help guide the development work I have planned.</description>

			<description>I was lucky to grow up in NYC, and had to commute from Queens to the Bronx every day to go to school. Some days I took the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bustime.mta.info/m/?q=Q44-SBS&amp;l=&quot;&gt;Q44&lt;/a&gt; bus over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx%E2%80%93Whitestone_Bridge&quot;&gt;Whitestone Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and other days I took the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bustime.mta.info/m/index;jsessionid=9F7ADE234676D22B101A192CAA31C55E?q=Q16&amp;l=&amp;t=&amp;cacheBreaker=1717915338805&quot;&gt;Q16&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;7 train&lt;/a&gt; through Manhattan, and then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;D trains&lt;/a&gt; up to 205th St in the Bronx. Took the same amount of time either way. So at age 15 I was able to go see the Grateful Dead after school at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillmore_East&quot;&gt;Fillmore East&lt;/a&gt; on April 27, 1971. Midway through the set, a special guest band who they didn't introduce started tuning up on stage. We all wondered who they were. I now know the history thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=500+Songs+podcast+beach+boys&quot;&gt;500 Songs podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and this was the return of a band that had fallen out of favor, a band whose hits we all heard on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC_(AM)#The_Musicradio_77_era_(1960%E2%80%931982)&quot;&gt;WABC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNEW-FM#%22Where_Rock_Lives%22&quot;&gt;WNEW-FM&lt;/a&gt;. When they started playing one of their biggest hits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations&quot;&gt;Good Vibrations&lt;/a&gt;, the audience erupted in ecstasy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys&quot;&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; now looking a lot different, but playing the same wonderful California music from the 60s. They couldn't be more different from the Dead, but there they were up on stage together. They were back, this time for good. This is a recording of the whole concert, the link &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kRKY-S4wI1s?si=zTwSE5tvk6LKNjjb&amp;t=2348&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; to the beginning of Good Vibrations. You can hear the gasp of recognition, and the bands recognition of the recognition, and from their it was a party in a party, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRKY-S4wI1s&amp;t=2508s&quot;&gt;sing-along part&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;gotta keep those a lovin' good vibrations happening with you.&quot; We were all growing up very quickly, but we had a moment when we could return to a more innocent time. Lovely the way music pulls you back in time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson&quot;&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt; wasn't there that night but his music certainly was.</description>

			<title>Democrats and men</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted a link to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml&quot;&gt;political disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; from 2018. Also listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-show-trumps-plot-against-the-2026-elections/683107/&quot;&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; with Senator Gallego of Arizona who says, correctly, that the Democrats have work to do with men. It's true, speaking as a man who has been voting solid Democratic since Kerry, but I didn't stop being a man, which is something that makes me cringe to say it, the way I cringed at admitting to being Jewish when I was a kid. I lived in a place where hate of Jews was always just under the surface in school, but not so well hidden at the playground. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Men as a gender were really pushed into a corner we couldn't get out of during #metoo, all men, not just some. If they say they weren't they're lying. I went to a future of journalism conference in 2018, and the only thing men talked about, quietly, among ourselves, was how scared we were of losing everything. It really was bad, but since then it's eased. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about #metoo in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/davewiner/politics.opml#1520013967000&quot;&gt;political disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, but didn't promote it for fear of retribution. I was threatened when I stood up for a friend whose life was ruined for as far as I could tell doing nothing wrong. If you don't shut up we'll do you too, basically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Women are people just like men, and when they got to rage online against men, even people I thought I knew and were friends behaved abhorently. The way we imagine Trump might deal with us soon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to add not all women, there were some who didn't forget that their male friends were still friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was very clear where the Democratic Party came down on all this, and of course, the Republicans took total advantage of this. If you want to understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere&quot;&gt;manosphere&lt;/a&gt; as you all call it, start here. I vote with you all, but absolutely abhor the way you pushed us all into a corner and shut down our pride. Women are people too and they can be just as ugly as men. If you believe otherwise you're believing lies. I speak from experience, I was raised to believe all women are saints. That lie did not prepare us well for life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good news is if the Democrats can make peace with men, there are a lot more votes available to us. We can put it behind us, but we can't ignore that in the late teens we went absolutely fucking batshit crazy about half of the electorate. It's amazing the whole thing didn't completely crumble, irrevocably. We can still fix it, but we have to acknowledge that men were hurt in that period. You all seem to have forgotten that we are just people too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Re-reading the #metoo section of the disclaimer I can't believe how I tiptoed around the truth. The truth I didn't dare say was it was a huge hate campaign as divisive as anything the Repubs ever did. In a country that was supposed to outlaw this, and from a political party that was supposed to be liberal. The &quot;both sides do it&quot; reality probably hasn't yet sunk in but the Democrats sided with sadists and fascists. No other way to put it. Men absolutely were silenced. Afraid to speak for fear of retribution. If you were on the wrong side of this you have some soul-searching to do. And you probably pushed a lot of people of all genders into voting for Trump. The Dems posture of &quot;who me?&quot; has an answer -- yes you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
