			<description>Yesterday's OpenAI big press event was a nothing burger. I thought they already had all of that stuff, they certainly had been at least telegraphing it. Also there never will be another Steve Jobs, it's too bad everyone is using his template for product announcements. It only works if you're Steve Jobs.</description>

			<description>BTW, I've been to three &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote&quot;&gt;Stevenotes&lt;/a&gt;, the first one, the rollout of the Mac  in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in 1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.</description>

He's a better speaker than either of the other candidates. If he didn't a speech impediment I'd say he was basically a sure thing. I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where &quot;future&quot; is less than a year away.</description>

			<title>Brunson as bad man or decoy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/14/brunson.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson&quot;&gt;Jalen Brunson&lt;/a&gt;, Knicks star, after having his ass kicked in Sunday's game. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season&quot;&gt;bench players&lt;/a&gt;, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been trying the new 4o version of ChatGPT. It's much faster. It certainly is a search engine. And it covers news. I asked it about Michael Cohen's testimony today in the Trump trial, and it gave me a summary. I asked for the weather forecast in Kingston NY. It wouldn't give me the lyrics to Martha My Dear by the Beatles. I asked it to draw a weather map of the mid-Atlantic states, but it drew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/13/205122.html&quot;&gt;usual garbage&lt;/a&gt; for technical images.</description>

			<description>Here's where we're headed now that we have AI programming partners. Creating software will be possible the way popular music is created. Watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt; was the Beatles sherpa, the same way my AI partner is my guide through unknown programming lands. It now doesn't matter if I have less experience building MySQL apps than others. I have the collective experience of &lt;i&gt;all of them&lt;/i&gt; here to help. My George Martin. What got me thinking about this is John Naughton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/11/chatgpt-ai-will-co-pilot-coders-to-new-heights-of-creativity?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about AI and programming.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to draw a weather map of the mid-Atlantic states, but it drew the usual garbage for technical images. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/13/weatherMap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Weather map.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every social web should offer the two same author-level moderation controls that Facebook does. 1. The author can delete comments. 2. The author can say who can respond.

I feel much smarter and better organized and it's harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive assistant.

Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</description>

			<title>The NYT runs on freedom and apparently they don't know that</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a hard idea to get across, but there's nothing wrong with a news organization favoring things they depend on to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, a news org that covers San Jose, CA is entitled to favor San Jose. It's okay for them to do things that help San Jose in competition with other cities. They could sponsor a food drive for the neediest in their community. It wouldn't be a conflict of interest, because it's understood that they have an interest in the success of San Jose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A columnist that covers the NY Mets can be happy when the Mets win the World Series, and sad when they don't. This is not an integrity issue, or something they need to disclose, unless it's not obvious that they cover the Mets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In that sense, every news org in the United States depends on the First Amendment, so it can be assumed they're in favor of democracy, because without it they couldn't exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why the editor of the NYT's statement about not favoring democracy is so ridiculous. He can't be objective about that, because the existence of his organization depends on the continuation of democracy in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whether he knows it or not, he's against Trump and in favor of the Democrats in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's hard to see what's totally obvious. Ask a fish about water and they'll say there is no such thing. Same with free speech and the NYT. They are a product of free speech, without it, it makes no sense, doesn't work. But that's been true forever, so it feels like a given, but it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's a bridge too far for many people. In other words, your understanding of feeds (RSS, Atom, etc) can be of service to others. And by collecting useful sources of news, maybe even insightful ones, we can help upgrade the quality of news we all get. The first step is to learn how to use FeedLand, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md&quot;&gt;it's pretty easy&lt;/a&gt;, esp if you already understand feeds. And with categories and OPML subscription lists, you can organize your feed reading everywhere, not just in FeedLand.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.co/company/press/archive/openai-partnership&quot;&gt;StackExchange and OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; have made a deal. I used to use StackExchange all the time, now I never do, ChatGPT is much better. There's a lot of anxiety out there, it seems but this is like shutting the barn door after the horse has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close_the_stable_door_after_the_horse_has_bolted&quot;&gt;bolted&lt;/a&gt;. There was a time when StackExchange was a godsend for programmers. But that time has passed. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. I was trying to figure out why some ancient code wasn't working. I never understood how it worked, and now I had to figure out what was going wrong. So I debugged it, carefully, step by step, with ChatGPT. It's as if I was working with another programmer who had read and fully understood every StackExchange message, and was willing to work with me for no pay to get to the bottom of the problem. This is what we call disruption. It's a whole new level of programming.

Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 09 May 2024 14:06:44 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/05/09.html#a140644"/>

I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134&quot;&gt;Voice Memo app&lt;/a&gt; to take notes while I'm programming. Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an &lt;i&gt;edited&lt;/i&gt; version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end). I understand that &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/&quot;&gt;$AAPL&lt;/a&gt; is depressed because the lack of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html&quot;&gt;AI story&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a use that every stock trader will understand immediately. Huge value. I'm sure others are doing it. But Apple has the high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I've owned a bunch of Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and I'm right.)</description>

It's actually much more than a blogroll, it's a feed reader. When a feed that I'm following updates, it moves to the top of the list. And if I want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/08/blogrollscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;see what's new&lt;/a&gt;, I just click on the wedge next to its name to reveal the most recent five posts. From there, I can get to the full post by clicking on the permalink. If you want to get a feel for it without taking the plunge yourself, you can leave my blog open in a browser tab. You'll get exactly what I get.</description>

			<description>BTW, I was struck that famous editor and writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@semaforben@threads.net&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; said he was ashamed at starting out as a blogger, on an MSNBC show hosted by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough&quot;&gt;true hack&lt;/a&gt;. The quote was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who like me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303&quot;&gt;cross-posts&lt;/a&gt; to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it. My comment: &quot;I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. What’s wrong with people?&quot; Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Cross-posting in 2024</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called &quot;legacy.&quot; The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The items in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I want broader distribution, I do this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open a new browser window.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I write some text into the Twitter tab.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Paste an image if there is one.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see one of these support the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I support the students</title>

I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, &quot;they don't really mean it.&quot; This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage&quot;&gt;umbrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt; of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a &quot;standard&quot; and thus was born Atom. My opinion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;one way is better&lt;/a&gt; than two, and they should have jumped on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to do that. It isn't going away. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. &quot;I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.&quot; I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1&quot;&gt;ChatGPT gave&lt;/a&gt; what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; is a product of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut&quot;&gt;Architecture Astronauts&lt;/a&gt;. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521&quot;&gt;need a BDG asap&lt;/a&gt;, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical &quot;busy developer.&quot; I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5&quot;&gt;you can't lie to a compiler&lt;/a&gt; axiom. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT is letting us customize the context in which our queries run. So I can say I use JavaScript so if I ask a programming question, it should answer in that language. I was happy to have this feature, and gave it a thumbs up. The idea is that we build up a highly detailed profile over time, so ChatGPT gets better at answering my questions. And it also locks us in. It didn't come up for me until Meta.ai came along and sometimes it's good to get a second opinion. But I want to share that profile info.</description>

He sat out most of the fourth quarter, was put back in at the very end and took the last Sixers desperation shot. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the other big Eastern Division game on Thursday, why did Doc Rivers, the Milwaukee Bucks' coach go into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_time&quot;&gt;garbage time&lt;/a&gt; when the Bucks were down by only 10 with 2.5 minutes remaining? What the frack was he thinking? Deficits like that are often made up, esp in elimination games? Being a good sport is one thing, but quitting the season early when you're only down by 10? What the what? I tuned in the game at the point when his stars were coming out, before the Knicks game started, and couldn't figure out why he was giving up so soon?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It couldn't actually happen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the pause between the first and second rounds of the NBA playoffs, I am having the very very very strange thought that maybe possibly maybe the Knicks will could possibly maybe perhaps nah never hmm -- go all the way?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, there are plenty of relatively low priced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stubhub.com/indiana-pacers-indianapolis-tickets-5-10-2024/event/152902691/?quantity=2&quot;&gt;tickets available&lt;/a&gt; at the Pacers arena for the May 10 game when the playoff heads to Indiana. This is one of the Knicks fans' favorite tactics. Since there are so many New Yorkers, spread out all over the country, and we're pretty much all Knicks fans, this can create a demoralizing effect for the opposition players who assume their hometown crowd will be rooting for them, not the other team. It had a pretty adverse effect on the Sixers a few days ago. I was chatting about this with fellow Knicks fan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=NakedJen&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; during last night's harrowing game, and said this might be a good tactic somehow in the election, if every time the opposition had a rally they discovered that most of the attendees were actually in favor of democracy and abortion rights.</description>

			<title>The soundtrack of your life</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've developed new appreciation for two musicians from my generation: George Harrison and Bob Dylan, thanks to the encouragement of two friends, both of whom have links to my childhood believe it or not, but who are current friends in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dotage&quot;&gt;dotage&lt;/a&gt; and they're both on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my first friend said she likes &lt;a href=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison&quot;&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt; the best of all the Beatles, and I thought that's weird because it really was down to Paul and John, I thought -- and then I heard this interview with George asking why he didn't explain in his memoir how he worshipped John as a kid, and George took exception, saying yeah in John's mind that's who I am, a kid who worshipped him, which I never did (says George). So now I have gone back through his music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others, and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980). And he was never going to be taken seriously by the others, so he had to get out of there to have the creative life he wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;About Dylan, the credit goes to my local friend and &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/song-173-all-along-the-watchtower-part-one-hes-not-the-messiah/&quot;&gt;Andrew Hickey&lt;/a&gt;, who focused my attention on the &lt;i&gt;music&lt;/i&gt; of Dylan's songs, when I had only been focusing on the lyrics. Silly of me. He only ever wanted to be seen as a musician, not a leader of anything, and that's where the difficulty came from, and why I wasn't really interested, even though I had listened to all the Dylan songs many times, and had a few of his albums growing up. So I just played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled_Up_in_Blue&quot;&gt;Tangled Up in Blue&lt;/a&gt; and realized this has been rolling around in my mind for days, and I wasn't even aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower&quot;&gt;All Along the Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; (another Dylan song) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;, which I just heard is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's time for another binge of that. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, two doors open, and that's always good. You know this is why you pick your music when you're young and stay with it, because it's the soundtrack of your life, and it has new relevance at every step of your evolution. Sure I listen to other music, but -- it's the songs that were big when I was little that matter most. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
