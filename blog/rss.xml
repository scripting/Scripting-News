			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://mrbrianpuck.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/260/&quot;&gt;WordLand user&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Does it make a difference if I can just dash off a short note without all the other bullshit that goes with publishing online.&quot; Yes, it should be as easy to take a note in WordPress as it is in Bluesky. I didn't buy that assumption that WordPress has to be heavy machinery for writers. What if I just want to write something quickly and get back to the other thing I was working on. Also the edit box in WordLand starts out the size of a tiny little text box, but grows as you add more words. You are allowed to keep going. No character limit.</description>

			<description>Just saw a report that styling isn't working in WordLand in latest versions of Safari. We're using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;MediumEditor&lt;/a&gt; to do the editing. Did a quick query in Claude.ai and there do appear to be some compatibility issues with Safari. A request that people actually report these problems in the repo, via the Support link in the main menu, otherwise it's hit or miss. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Since Bluesky gave us the ability to limit responses to people I follow, the amount of spam/abuse has been reduced to a trickle. People can still comment, by quoting my post. But they want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, to gain exposure to my followers. Helping promote &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; ideas is not their idea of fun.</description>

			<title>Day 4 of WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Aziz Poonawalla wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://azizhp.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/7482/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of WordLand. I'd like to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I'd like to say I put a lot of thought into this product, so it is the way it is for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a writing world where we get the features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt;. So your belief that the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I'm not saying limits in software aren't good. A product is as much defined by what it can't do as with what it does. All feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it finds in feeds, because RSS doesn't place any limits what you can use. So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed reading software, I've said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who does &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;, and he was quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element in your feeds and in your feed reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You say there's no use-case -- but there is a use-case, just not for you which is fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a shame that is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;, imho, is exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. They were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some reason they didn't. It's so weird to me, I'm like a time traveler who has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of a product like WordPress. It's supposed to be a place writers love to come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It's just a beginning, there's lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to anywhere begins with one step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to Bluesky and Mastodon -- because they both support outbound RSS, we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of published feeds. I fully intend to integrate features from FeedLand in WordLand. That's why the names are so similar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that you like &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, this isn't in the way of it and it isn't in the way of WordLand. I'm in regular contact with Manton, and if his product grows, I win because he's got the right model. He's still trying to work with the limited platforms and I, again, gave up. That right there defines the two products. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate my writing because I couldn't use links, and I couldn't edit or have more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and I had to make a choice. I'm doing it again, but now have made the investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they didn't. Should I give up there? Maybe. Maybe we were destined to give up on the web as a writer's platform. But I saw so much potential there in 1994 when I started working here exclusively. That potential is still very much there, you just have to believe, and against all odds, I do still believe. One more time, let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's okay if you don't use it, but I wanted to disagree with some of your conclusions. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote every word on this page, not an AI bot, in case you were wondering. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Day 3 of WordLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post that needed to be on the blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The groundrules here are -- if you see a problem in the support group and you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's important to develop a community here if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; is going to gain users, and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for blazing a new trail. If it's just me, the results are predictable and not good -- I'm one old man here, with limited capability. The product still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think the result will be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to bootstrap something new -- a social network without all the problems of Twitter et al. Ultimately the limits they impose on writers are unacceptable. I've waited for them to fix these problems for 18 years now, and I've come to see, amazingly, they don't see them as problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into 300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call it the web? (End of editorial.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides, reading and writing. We've got reading covered from a technical standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my stuff with others, &lt;i&gt;easily.&lt;/i&gt; Unlike the twitter-like systems, which are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn't actually work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion and stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical form. Makes sure WL's idea of a category is a good match with WP's. I am a very casual WordPress user as you can see from &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;my test site&lt;/a&gt;. I like the template, but it has errors in it. I don't plan on becoming a WordPress expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all kinds of other stuff where I'm the only expert. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting in 2001. There's absolutely no question it's the consensus platform for web publishing. There are others, but the one that's most deeply installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It's a 20+ year thing, and they've done an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; job of maintaining compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the consensus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It's an important time when help is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They should have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS.

				<source:outline text="I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting in 2001. There's absolutely no question it's the consensus platform for web publishing.

It's a 20+ year thing, and they've done an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; job of maintaining compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s still works today.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; is where we start to boot up a simple social net using only &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; as the protocol connecting users. Rather than wait for ActivityPub and AT Proto to get their acts together. I think we can do it with feeds and start off with &lt;i&gt;immediate&lt;/i&gt; interop without the complexity of federation. I call it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feediverse.org/&quot;&gt;feediverse&lt;/a&gt;. It's not a joke, although it may incite a smile and a giggle. And that's ok.</description>

			<title>Who is Elon Musk?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalism is as usual writing news they could have written last year and should have if they weren't dreaming that somehow we'd escape End of Democracy 2.0. And we know how that turned out, about the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Hillary%27s%20Emails%22&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who is Elon Musk? Until I read his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk&quot;&gt;Wikipedia profile&lt;/a&gt; last week, I only had a vague idea. I wanted to know if he was actually raised in South Africa, when he left, and what influence it had on him. I'll let you read the article. We should be examining every nook and cranny of who this unelected guy who never was in a debate, or won a primary or an election, or had his background investigated, and remains untouched by any kind of examination. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His security detail was just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/elon-musk-private-security-deputized-marshals-service/index.html&quot;&gt;deputized&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usmarshals.gov/&quot;&gt;US Marshals Service&lt;/a&gt;. What next? Maybe they'll just give him control of the military and get on with it. You can see that's coming, maybe in March, or sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do you think he'd have any &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compunction&quot;&gt;compunction&lt;/a&gt; against using the military against Americans? This isn't his country. So Americans probably mean nothing special to him. Since we played a role in the overthrow of their apartheid, probably the opposite. I wonder who or what he cares about. Has he ever answered a question without deflecting? Is there any reporter who could or would interview him? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If journalism were really doing their job seriously, they would report on this because this is what we're thinking. When will jouralism get that they are one of us, not above us? The sooner that light goes on, the better.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a good story for one of fierce courageous reporters at the NY Times. Who should be more scared of what's coming?

But I'm going to keep using it, and maybe I'll think of something that makes it fun or worthwhile, or maybe I'll just chalk it up to another learning experience.</description>

It's really hard to see the resemblance between today's Eddie and young Eddie, but there it was, the comic brilliance. Then they ask the real Tracy if they are related and he said he doesn't see it.</description>

			<description>Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; disappoint you. Don't blame them when it happens, because they can't be as good as people think they are. They're a startup in a tough market. Sooner or later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards. There isn't one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise up, give them a little the Rachel we love.</description>

The idea that it's some kind of conversation -- no it really doesn't resemble a conversation. I would like to try a social network that didn't have the concept of replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn't be able to insert something into someone else's flow, which is where all the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the person it's in reply to, so you don't end up getting speeches under your posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don't bother reading anything that's related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can enter the flow. We've been doing this, the way we do it, since the inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics, specifically graph theory -- and the Twitter way of organizing people and discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged. Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can't intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck. And she's talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it's going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all get that, and that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are part of it, the better things will turn out, imho.</description>

			<title>Threads in Bluesky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones, for a fresh start, but then I started getting ideas, and decided to go for it. I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An example of AI use</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to ChatGPT. Here's the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the trip, I don't mind going out of my way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services and notable bike trails. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;A logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also offered information about weather considerations. It's not necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example because I've done this trip a number of times and was curious how things had developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I find a Starbucks not too far off the route I'm on. If you were plotting the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a continuum of services that have developed over the years that make information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers questions you have in the way you think of asking them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 &quot;&gt;link to the response&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Slow down please</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that.

I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community.

			<title>My offer to Democrats in DC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A simple idea, a quid pro quo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate that we will support them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are the government of the US, Congress represents us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have been too passive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then, they have to include us in governing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No more shutting off the connection after the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seems like a fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can't moderate comments under your own posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone says something abusive, it's there for everyone to see, forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to feel respected.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-Xbn92mXE&quot;&gt;two-minute demo&lt;/a&gt; of my new writing tool for Bluesky. This is quite a bit simpler than the last version, you log on directly to Bluesky, doesn't go through my server at all. This removes a whole layer of complexity for the user, and means a lot of people can use it without it having to scale up. Also made it simpler, more of a writing tool, closer to where I'd like this stuff to be when we have across-the-board textcasting support. Really focused on the flow for writers.</description>

			<description>Re-did the social media links at the bottom of each story page. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/13/socialMediaLinks.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Used to be just RSS and Linkedin. I got rid of Linkedin because I never use it. Added Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads. Debated whether to remove Twitter, but it is still a way to follow my posts, the ones that go out through the linkblog. A lot of people still use Twitter. Had to include the latest version of Font-Awesome, but since my story pages don't otherwise use FA, I figured nothing could break. Haha. ;-)</description>

			<title>The United States is not a Silicon Valley company</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had an experience few people have had, and it's relevant to the way all of us feel right now. The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company. I was the CEO. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn't work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don't take orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That's why Musk and Trump are having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works, because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have rights that must be respected. That &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be respected or all hell will break loose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you, the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you didn't have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the US, until they aren't a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren't going to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or young, LBGTQ or whatever -- we all are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state&quot;&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt;, ie we don't have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might take some getting used to by him). We don't take orders from him, or anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you're supposed to sit here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction. The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they're fucking with, and they don't want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short time because you can't be part of the disaster they're creating. And always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has done with Twitter, as we've seen many SV companies have. But again, for the 18th time, &lt;i&gt;the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn't know he had terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes men, they never would have told him. And he didn't want to hear it from a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large organizations are nothing compared with the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
