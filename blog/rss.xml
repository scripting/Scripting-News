BTW, well-kept secret, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that takes one of these outlines and publishes it to the web, in the format you see on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. If you can get your text to flow through OPML this way, you can have a replica of this site, with most of its features. And you can totally customize it in CSS.  It's open source and very stable. It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt; and I wrote it in 2017 because I wanted my old blog back, I was fed up with trying to fit into the very small world defined by Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook and Medium. I decided then the cost was too high, and I'd be much happier if I lived within the limits of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, which is far better than the text formats defined by these other projects. Now I feel hopeful about this -- because &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22brent%20simmons%22&quot;&gt;Brent&lt;/a&gt; is supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=source%3Amarkdown&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;. This is a big thing, because it will have the power to attract authors, developers of blogging systems, and other feed reading products.</description>

			<description>I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/10/29/184306.html#a184449&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; about Philippe Kahn the other day, and just remembered -- I forgot to write about &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Turbo%20Pascal%22&quot;&gt;Turbo Pascal&lt;/a&gt;. I had been using program compilers for C and Pascal for almost a decade when it came out, and it was shockingly different in a good way. Somehow it could compile a whole program in less than a second. Years before I had developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=ThinkTank&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; on the Apple II and IBM PC using Pascal, and it often took &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt; to do the same thing! This changed languages in a great way -- later I would switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22think%20c%22&quot;&gt;Think C&lt;/a&gt; that had the same instant compiling. There were other great things about Turbo Pascal, because the editor was integrated, so you could start that compilation with a single keystroke. He understood that the quicker this was, the more in a groove the developer could get. Imagine if you had to wait a minute before you could read the prose you just wrote? It used to be like that. Going back to the 70s it would sometimes take many minutes, and you could run out of time, and wouldn't be able to change the software until they added more money to your account. Like the horse and buggy days. How far we've come.</description>

			<description>Wonder if you noticed that the main difference between social media and chat is which way the new messages flow and where the tiny little text box is, at the top or the bottom.</description>

			<description>The unique thing about neighbors is you can try to divorce them, but no matter what you do they will still be neighbors. There are few relationships as permanent as neighbor. They don't have to listen to you. But you should listen anyway, and try to figure out how they look at the neighborhood. Probably very differently from the way you view it.</description>

We're getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt; back in shape. About a week ago we sorted out a long-standing performance issue. Once that was fixed, another problem cropped up, we weren't able to sign off and back on. We got that one too, this morning, and now it looks like feedland.com is finally performing well across the board. It's always been pretty stable, just churning away on feeds, reading lists, and pumping news over websockets, and all the other 3.0 type feed stuff. It feels like it's time to depend on it, even so we'll be careful, praise Murphy. The cool thing about feedland.com compared to all the other servers I've run stuff on over the years is that it scales automatically. It's on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpvip.com/&quot;&gt;VIP&lt;/a&gt; network run by Automattic.</description>

			<description>At the same time I heard from people at Automattic that they had successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall&quot;&gt;installed&lt;/a&gt; the new version of the FeedLand software on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=politics&quot;&gt;feedland.com&lt;/a&gt; which runs on their VIP system, so theoretically should scale as well as anything on the net. There was a serious performance problem, that, with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ohryan.ca/author/admin/&quot;&gt;Ryan Neudorf&lt;/a&gt; who I met in Ottawa, and Scott Hanson, longtime contributor here, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDev/issues/8&quot;&gt;fixed&lt;/a&gt;. It was a daring move, it meant that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the timeline-generating code in FeedLand had to be rewritten. It was worth it. If you've ever felt that FeedLand was too slow at displaying news, please try again, I think you'll be pleased.</description>

			<description>Since many of us now program with AI chatbot assistance, it seems it's time to think about higher level languages we can use to specify what we're doing, new kinds of computers because we now have bigger more capable minds at work.</description>

			<description>Every OS should have a Help system that you can ask &quot;How do I do this&quot; and it understands what you're saying.

			<title>Honoring people who are alive</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be great if there was a holiday once a year where each of us had a virtual awards show for people we know who have special qualities that make them excellent people or friends. We put all our focus on a few personalities who have obvious defects. And we don't express public gushing love until people die. How much better our lives would be if we focused on the good, generous and creative people among us who have made our lives better? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would honor people I love because they project strength and empathy, for me that would be AOC who I'd love to have as a niece or sister, or aunt, and no doubt she'd make a great mom. I don't like Schumer because he's sad and stupid. We need someone in that role who's more like JFK or even LBJ. Confident bordering on arrogance. Someone with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=gravitas&quot;&gt;gravitas&lt;/a&gt; Schumer doesn't project. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would give an award to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Philippe%20Kahn%22&quot;&gt;Philippe Kahn&lt;/a&gt; for practical brilliance. I've learned from everyone I've competed with, and he had a practical philosophy about software I had never seen before. A feature that he saw that made the product more brilliant. They weren't huge things, but they showed he was thinking about the user.

That's the kind of spirit I admire. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was on panels with him a few times, he always had funny things to say, irreverant, sarcastic, but one time he let Bill Gates have it (he was in the room) and called him out for &quot;hogging the fast lane&quot; -- and even though I don't remember what the issue was, I do remember that I knew he was totally right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's very much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Kahn&quot;&gt;alive&lt;/a&gt; as far as I know. But I think it would be nice to write our epitaphs while the people we're praising are around to hear it! So going back to the original awards, that would be a requirement, the people you call out must be alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I checked out Elon Musk's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; to Wikipedia by going to the pages on &lt;a href=&quot;https://grokipedia.com/page/Wikipedia&quot;&gt;his site&lt;/a&gt; that Wikipedia mangles the most, in my experience. It looks like they basically copied Wikipedia, if so it's no better or worse. They'll probably be able to improve it, because ChatGPT tells a much closer to actual-events story. Net-net getting the story right is more important imho than keeping democracy open to trolls.</description>

			<description>The trip to Canada really changed my perspective. Spending more time thinking than developing new stuff. One thing is for sure, we're going to depend on FeedLand more as we go two-way in WordLand. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22radio%20userland%22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; before.

A funeral for two murdered cops. The police stand at attention, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/26/deBlasioPolice.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;backs turned&lt;/a&gt; on the mayor. This was a statement about him for sure, but even more about their disdain for the people who elected him, you and me, the people they're sworn to protect. I grew up in NY, and had plenty of experience with NY cops and this kind of disrespect is, from my point of view, who they are. I know they see themselves as martyrs, that's what the demonstration meant. But they also have a job to do and a chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of pent up resentment and you can't just wish it away. The mayor, for better or worse, owns it. I can't imagine they'd have much respect for the Democratic Party nominee. Like it or not, this is the city NYers live in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am old enough to remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay&quot;&gt;John Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;, a liberal Republican, back when there were such things, was the newly elected mayor in 1966 and was greeted by a transit strike, shutting down subways and buses. The unions walked all over him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think NYC and NYers will fare better with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo&quot;&gt;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't the first time I've stood up for him &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=cuomo&quot;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;. He resigned in disgrace, humiliated, but I never will forget his leadership during the darkest times of Covid. Cuomo, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; at the NY Times and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci&quot;&gt;Dr Anthony Fauci&lt;/a&gt; were the bright beams of intelligence and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>House of Dynamite</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-house-of-dynamite/&quot;&gt;House of Dynamite&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic movie, it deserved the great reviews it's getting, and I found it easy to watch, though a lot of reviewers said it wasn't. It's exactly the kind of movie I like -- political thriller with ideas rich with intrigue. Great acting and writing. It's the 2025 version of Fail Safe. Both are like stage play, but this one examines the story from all angles, very skillfully, so the story is told iteratively. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The president in this story is throughtful and deliberative with no time to think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's provocative because the person who would make that choice &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; just destroyed part of the most famous building in the country on a whim, presumably to show us he has the power to destroy things, which you will not doubt even slightly when you watch House of Dynamite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you watch the movie, hold the thought in the back of your mind. What would Trump do. There was a time when we chose presidents based on our willingness them to have them decide whether or not to launch the nukes. We lost that perspective, but the problem never went away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>WordPress and AI</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I see that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2025/05/announcing-the-formation-of-the-wordpress-ai-team/&quot;&gt;WordPress world&lt;/a&gt; is getting interested in adding AI features. I had some &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/09/28/132152.html&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/07/12/134525.html&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/20/151234.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html&quot;&gt;ago&lt;/a&gt;, about how I would like AI to be hooked up to blogging, and the ideas have developed a bit in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a writer I want most is every bit of writing I’ve published turned into any kind of book I want at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example of a book lurking in the archive of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A user’s guide to FeedLand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the AI would pull a users manual together on command, I’d feel more comfortable writing about it on my blog. As it is there’s a lot of good info between other blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a great time to invest in new ideas for writers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have pretty good search on my blog, but so much more is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a series of book types you could ask your AI friend to build for you from your own writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually all user's guides will be assembled by AI. In the case of software products it should have already happened, though I'm just as behind the curve as everyone else is in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course the first docs to be produced that way would be &lt;i&gt;A user's guide to WordPress.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Think different about developers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tell the people who make AI's -- I want a way to have apps run in your browser that has direct connections to the AI engine, and it connects via the user's credentials, not the app devs (though you are entitled to know who the developer is). When I explored the idea of making apps for ChatGPT, this was the roadblock, I have to become a reseller of your service. Can't you figure out how to let the user pay directly? I just want to make tools, not be in the retail AI business. Feh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the same problem web devs have, we have to become resellers for Amazon S3. Why can't Amazon, who already has an account for every freaking person in the world, let the user own their own data, which I believe they would &lt;i&gt;reallllly&lt;/i&gt; like. I don't want access to it, I just want to make great tools for them to use. And they're free to use other products with the data. This helps encourage data format standards. It's why the PC software market was so much more vibrant than the web developer market. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep trying to explain this to people who aren't web devs, but in a position to help, and make a shitload of money, but all I get is blank stares, and &quot;we don't do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>weblogs.com re-viewed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I did some research into how weblogs.com, in 1999, tracked changes in the blogs it was following. This was a precursor to feed readers. There was a main output file called changes.xml,  a reverse chronological list of sites, not feeds, feeds didn't exist yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000620090706/http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of weblogs.com looked like in June 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000621141352/http://www.weblogs.com/about&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that explained what weblogs are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt; from weblogs.com on Dec 13, 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=changes.xml&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; of scripting.com for changes.xml.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/c/68f8f563-0ab8-8322-865a-af0cc88fa35a&quot;&gt;ask ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; to tell you about changes.xml. I did, it was able to put together all the random bits that are now gone, it found them somewhere and I got a much better answer than I would have gotten if somehow all my docs had survived, and most of them did not. This btw is one of the great features of ChatGPT. Truly a miracle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/c/68f8f563-0ab8-8322-865a-af0cc88fa35a&quot;&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of my talk with ChatGPT about this stuff. Sometimes these links don't work for everyone. I wish they would get that working, dear friends at OpenAI. This is how your word of mouth builds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You could use any blogging tool, and any feed reader and still be part of the world. Substack is a single company that has raised VC money. Vastly different incentives.&quot; And this has been tested. You have to use their editor to publish in their enviroment.

The old White House will have served its purpose. We shouldn't even build a &lt;i&gt;new White House&lt;/i&gt; on that location, just like we shouldn't have built a skyscraper in place of the World Trade Center. I wanted to see a mosque and a synagogue, a new football stadium, perhaps. A nice park. A place for a camp fire. Anything but an indestructable office building. We have so many of them. But where are the spaces for kids to play and learn and be friends. No, in place of the White House, I want to see a gorgeous public library. A place of learning. And a softball field and a nice swimming pool. We can tell the kids that once a bad old man lived here, and we decided it'd be more fun to have a big playground instead.</description>

			<description>On my drive to Ottawa and back, I never had to wait for a charger, and it never took more than 1/2 hour to fill the battery to 80%. The chargers are often in places with restaurants or supermarkets. And it's good for my legs to get out of the car and walk for a bit.</description>

			<description>I wish WordPress had a &quot;home&quot; social network. The community is all over the place, on Twitter, Slack, Masto, Bluesky, GitHub, and probably a few other places. I hope to have a social network that is built on WordPress and RSS. It would be open to the public, and anyone could start their own, by running an easy to install piece of software on a server.</description>

			<description>I have to remember to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/10/19/what-i-did-on-my-trip-to-canada-part-1/&quot;&gt;use WordLand&lt;/a&gt; to post &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org&quot;&gt;to Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, because when I go in that way, I don't have a character limit and I can use styling. We were wrestling with this question at WC, how to market the feature in a way that would get people to go to WordPress to write for Mastodon. It would also be cool if you could turn on the ActivityPub connection in WordLand, without having to wade through all the menus and dialogs. Imagine if we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/19/activityPubDialog.png&quot;&gt;confirmation dialog&lt;/a&gt; like this in WordLand.</description>

			<description>I have a really interesting idea for Netflix. Do a MCP so I can ask ChatGPT to find a show I'd probably like on Netflix. Then Hulu would have to hook up too, and HBO and Apple and everyone else. That would fix a big entertainment problem because I've already taught ChatGPT exactly what I like in movies and serials by giving it all my favorite shows and why I liked them so much. This was the idea of Bingeworthy, which I never seem to find time to work on. I really just want the freaking functionality. Someone should buy Metacritic btw, their process, however it works, is really good at finding the good stuff. But please someone who believes in open APIs, it totally needs to be in the Chativerse.</description>

			<title>What I did on my trip to Canada, part 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I presented &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt; for the first time publicly, the new one with a timeline, so it more clearly shows how we can build a beautiful social network just from open formats and protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No user lock-in, every part replaceable, and open to developers to add functionality without having to reimplement the whole thing. These are all the things I think that have stood in the way of innovation in the web for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A social network that starts out with no centralization and open in every sense has a much better chance of being decentralized than one that starts out centralized and swears they're going to stop doing that -- someday, fingers crossed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back home from my trip to Ottawa. Took the scenic route through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Mountains&quot;&gt;Adirondacks&lt;/a&gt;. Had an unqualified great trip. Should've gone to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=WordCamp&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago. It's totally my type of people. I have a long list of things to organize, but for now it's time to catch up on sleep and rest, MLB and NBA, and make plans for the future.</description>

			<description>I'm back at &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp&lt;/a&gt; in a big room waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; to answer questions for the people here. Yesterday's presentation went really well, lots of smart people really interested, fantastic discussion after. A very nice web culture. I went with three slides to get started, and then talked, demo'd, answered questions, and listened to ideas. Told a few jokes. Got a few laughs. It got the job done, help feed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-of-mouth_marketing&quot;&gt;word of mouth&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordland.social/&quot;&gt;WordLand&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Good morning from Ottawa</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bullets.opml.org/?url=https://drummer.land/dave.winer@gmail.com/wordcampSlides.opml&quot;&gt;link to the slides&lt;/a&gt; promised below. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been going back and forth on slides. I always do this. In the end I hate slides because I digress while going through them and skip ahead, end up wishing I hadn't used them. So I decided to compromise. I'll do the first three in some detail, and digress and go down tangents as I see fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The three main slides.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Accomplishments of WordPress. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why podcasting retained its independence. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Demo of WordLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were 20 or 30 more slides after that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what I'll do is this. Present the first two in some detail, then page through the rest quickly and come back and do the demo. Also publish a link to the deck on my blog so people can scroll through them at their leisure. And once the demo is done, I'll answer questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an idea that we can have a blogosphere that is as functional as podcasting. We just need users to get started, to get the idea off the ground. We don't have to accept the limits, we can have the full web if we want it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Times I've been ambushed at conferences</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I think I'm done. I've got the outline for the slides complete. I can't possibly talk about all the stuff that's in the slides. Once I leave tomorrow I think perhaps I'll post a link for the slides and maybe offer a place to comment. Maybe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I get very nervous about these things and then remember when I've prepared as much as I have for this, the talk goes quickly and people generally are nice, though I've been ambushed a few memorable times. Let's see -- Austin, Cambridge, San Francisco and Nashville come to mind. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Austin it was because I was privileged. I was being honored because it was the 25th year of my blog, and I was one of the keynoters. I told the promoter his people wouldn't like me, and then I forgot I said it when it happened. I was stuck, I didn't want to get into a public argument with anyone. (Had I wanted to rebut, I would have said everyone in this room is privileged, just look around at how well fed and educated everyone is. We all flew in here. We live in a rich country where we are the elite of the elite. Now STFU, in my dreams.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There have been times when I welcomed an argument...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, I was invited to lead a panel from the music industry about how great Napster was. This was probably in 2000 or 2001 when Napster was at its peak. It was an ambush. All the panelists made me the issue, and then they voted to kick me off the stage. I stayed there and waited until they exhausted their rage, and then asked them a question about music and Napster. Acted like nothing had happened. I had earned my place there, I was a very early industry adopter of Napster. I loved what it did for us. Imagine until then you either had to buy an album to listen to music, build a collection, or wait until it was played on the radio. (What is radio? Kind of an early form of podcasting.) People were talking about music in supermarkets and airports. This could not be stopped, I was sure of it, and they were acting like babies. I stood up and prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Nashville, I was invited to be a sort of keynoter for a conference that was patterned after BloggerCon. I did not organize it, but I led a session, which was attended by a famous right wing blogger who I had invited to the Harvard BloggerCon. He brought a bunch of his friends, and they each said no one was listening to them but we were listening to them. I eventually sat down and let them have a session dominated by a few people repeating themselves. It was boring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I was set up by the promoters of a CMS conference which Berkman hosted at Harvard. I was the master of ceremonies. No one told me that one of my most virulent trolls was there, and when he got up to rage at me I asked him to sit down, but Charlie Nesson who was the senior educator there, and kind of naive about internet trolls, said he should speak his mind. I should have walked out at that point. I knew what was coming. It really shook me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Nashville a columnist in a local paper who said I caused the riot, btw. I swear to god I always take my discussion leader role seriously. I gave them all a chance to talk and they all said the same thing, almost as if they had been told to say it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The web crashes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's remember how the web could have worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The ideal is to write in our blog space, and publish everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what we have been trying to do since Twitter came along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Write on your main blog, cross-post everywhere it belongs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This could have worked, and it still can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it can't work until we get agreement on what text is. This will be much-discussed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Canada&lt;/a&gt; this week, based on what &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/plugins/activitypub&quot;&gt;WordPress is doing&lt;/a&gt; and what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Prodromou&quot;&gt;Evan Prodromou&lt;/a&gt; will speak about and of course what I am speaking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Getting back on track is as simple as agreeing what text is on the web. For that we have two very good models: HTML and Markdown.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/13/theWebCrashes.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Here's my slide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today's song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3QZVdqUidw&quot;&gt;Oh My Love&lt;/a&gt;, by John Lennon. I was trying to remember this song. It kept eluding me. It's not one of his most famous. It's what you experience when you fall in love. Clarity. Endless possibility. At home in your life. For the first time.</description>
