If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@mossbergwalt/post/C7rli4JJ3St&quot;&gt;Walt Mossberg shows&lt;/a&gt; why ChatGPT is such a conversation-starter, and thus is incredible art. He asked it to draw a picture of himself with Kara Swisher. Of course everyone did that, and posted the result to the thread. The variety of responses is amazing, revealing of what I'm not sure. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C7uYdAcJpTQ&quot;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; it came up with for me.</description>

			<description>I bet you could do a beautifully readable blog by just dynamically rendering its RSS feed.  Why bother statically rendering the home page, month page, day page or pages for each individual post. Dynamic servers are so cheap these days.</description>

Ken Smith pointed out the story in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308&quot;&gt;very last postscript&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, I hadn't put it together that podcasting worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his. That guaranteed two things -- that the technology would be maximally simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn't matter, in fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts, that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.</description>

It's the story of tech. Something new and explosive comes out, and the journalists feel threatened by it (always, in every way, even when it has nothing to do with them) and a few others (music industry with Napster, artists with ChatGPT) see amateurs invading their previously exclusive space. Truth is these new technologies give new tools for expression of ordinary untrained people. Now we get to have fun with sharing what we see, and maybe the professionals have to reorient themselves to the rest of the world. One thing you can't do and hope not to be left behind, is ignore the new tech, if you want to understand, don't depend on what you read in the news orgs, because they are always full of shit about new tech. You have to go discover it for yourself. And when someone says they're blown away by the new stuff they can do, listen to them, don't argue, try to understand. There's a lot of growth locked up in understanding. So please read the piece, we're at one of those points now wrt to ChatGPT. Sure, it knows a lot of stuff, that's great, but there's also it's ability to listen and understand us. This is what's really new here.</description>

			<description>Sometimes the On This Day feature in Facebook surfaces some questions that should be asked regularly. For example. 1. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02MA2JoTwY1oEYhuxmhuvarmVsaMqX6Gi6dADc3i8C8acFK3j3xNdw6W8GrG2vnoNgl&quot;&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt; what do librarians think of ChatGPT. Only one response. Maybe more this year. If there are any librarians blogging about their experiences with ChatGPT, please send me a link and I will add them to my AI category. If &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; is writing about new discoveries they've made, I want to hear about it.</description>

			<title>Trump today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I try not to post pictures of Trump on this blog since he left office in 2021, but this is too good not to share. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2024/06/01/trumpOnEscalator.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Pretty sure this is a meme, not an actual New Yorker cover. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
