			<title>The Spurlocks of RSS-Land</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a product announcement from Jake Spurlock -- a new feed reader called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakespurlock.com/2026/02/today-comes-to-the-mac/&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;. From the description sounds well-thought-out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He explains -- &quot;Google killed Reader in 2013. I've been chasing that feeling ever since. So I built it.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also know someone named &lt;i&gt;John&lt;/i&gt; Spurlock, who I &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22john%20spurlock%22&quot;&gt;worked on&lt;/a&gt; some OPML and RSS stuff for Bluesky in 2023. I sent a note of congrats to him, when I really should've sent it to Jake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/18/spurlockScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the conversation I had with ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And text of the email I sent congratulating the wrong Spurlock.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Congrats on the new product!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Haven't tried it yet, I don't generally use Apple's store on my Mac, not sure why. I will do it though.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your product looks nice and well-thought out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And there are some ways we could work together now that I think you'll find interesting, like using FeedLand to get you instant updates based on rssCloud, assuming you haven't figured out how to support it from a client. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also OPML subscriptions are nice too. Another thing I'd like to get going, and need someone to work with on to make it happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I wonder if they're related? Have they met each other? Do they know of the havoc they are bringing to the formerly simple world of RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20171005153425/http://forewordbootstrap.blorkmark.com/&quot;&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bootstrap-Responsive-Development-Jake-Spurlock/dp/1449343910&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; Jake Spurlock wrote for O'Reilly about the Bootstrap Toolkit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Maybe they worked at one time. I used ChatGPT as I often do to get help on one of these antiquated sites.

Why not instead charge per article. Like a toll you pay on a road you drive on once every few years. On further thought, I wouldn't even have an exception for Atlanta residents. If they start spending more money than a subscription costs, you could offer a subscription then, as a way to save money. Kind of the way Amazon lets you buy a certain amount of coffee beans without requiring you to sign up for monthly delivery. They do tell you how much you'd save if you subscribed. Everyone appreciates a chance to save money, but still might not want the commitment. And asking someone from upstate NY to subscribe to the Atlanta Journal Constitution is a total bullshit. An insult to both our intelligences.</description>

			<title>VCs and CEOs don't fire your devteams yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Aram Zucker-Scharff &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/chronotope.aramzs.xyz/post/3mf23tbnn722z&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I don't want to read one more thinkpiece about blackbox AI code factories until you can show me what they've produced.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've made the same request, and there was very little even brilliant programmers could show, including some who have become influencers in the AI space. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem -- it takes a lot of skill and patience to make software that appears simple because it gives users what they expect. It's much easier to write utility scripts, where the user writes the code for themselves.

			<title>New RSS feature from Manton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I asked Manton Reece if he could add a feature that gave me a feed of replies to me on his service, micro.blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I post a lot of stuff to micro.blog via my linkblog RSS feed. Every one of those items can be commented on. But unless I visit micro.blog regularly, I don't see the comments. I guess people have mostly figured out that I'm an absent poster, and don't say anything. Even so, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; some replies. Wouldn't it be great if the responses could show up in my blogroll. And of course if there was an RSS feed of the replies, I would see them when I was looking for something possibly interesting, one of the main reasons I have a blogroll, and keep finding new uses for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The feed is &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/16/blogrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; now, I'm subscribed and new comments are posted in the feed and Murphy-willing I will see them.  &lt;i&gt;Bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/feeds/dave/mentions.xml&quot;&gt;https://micro.blog/feeds/dave/mentions.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a killer feature for sure. But the best part of it is this -- here are two developers working together. This is how the web works when it's working. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW a suggestion. Right now the title on my feed is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Micro.blog - dave mentions&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a problem in the limited horizontal space in the blogroll. A more useful title would be: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;dave&quot; mentions on micro.blog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you were building a social network out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; this would be an essential feature. It also validates Manton's intuition to allow people like me to be absentee publishers to his community. But the missing piece was allowing the conversation to be two-way, which it now is. That deserves another &lt;i&gt;bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reducing tab clutter in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, when I get too many tabs open from things I haven't looked at in a while, this is what I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I choose Add Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The menu opens with the new bookmark at the top of the list&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it's the first time I press Return and enter &quot;Tabs I Closed Recently&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I drag the new bookmark under that headline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Close the Bookmarks tab.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remove the tab I just bookmarked.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Voila!

			<source:markdown>In [Drummer](http://drummer.land/), when I get too many tabs open from things I haven't looked at in a while, this is what I do.&#10;&#10;1.  I choose Add Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu&#10;2.  The menu opens with the new bookmark at the top of the list&#10;3.  If it's the first time I press Return and enter &quot;Tabs I Closed Recently&quot;&#10;4.  Then I drag the new bookmark under that headline.&#10;5.  Close the Bookmarks tab.&#10;6.  Remove the tab I just bookmarked.&#10;7.  Voila! Clutter Reduced.</source:markdown>

			<title>Ideas for the fediverse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Bullet items for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fediforum.org/2026-03-growing-open-social-web/&quot;&gt;Fediforum conference&lt;/a&gt; in March.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Subscribing must be easy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some things will work better if they're slightly centralized, esp subscribing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use DNS for naming people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Support RSS in and out, and test it once you add the feature, so many easy things to fix remain broken (like titles of the feeds, look terrible in a list of feed titles). RSS is how you earn the &quot;web&quot; in your name. &quot;Web&quot; means something, it's just an intention, there are rules. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't need &quot;open&quot; if you have &quot;web.&quot; The web is by definition open. Water is wet. Raises question re what the not-open web is. (Silo.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Support the basic features of text in the web. If you shut off the writing features of the web, as Twitter did, you're not really part of the web. Especially linking.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Listen to users, listen to other developers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Automattic is doing heroic work connecting WordPress to ActivityPub. This means that WordPress APIs are now ActivityPub APIs. Not a small thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Look at text coming out of WordPress into Mastodon, the HTML used definitely could be improved. Seems pretty simple things to fix, the simple things matter. Example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2026/02/16/new-rss-feature-from-manton/&quot;&gt;WordPress version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/116080779314131849&quot;&gt;Mastodon version&lt;/a&gt; of the same post. Let's make this beautiful!  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Keep trying fundamentally new architectures. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Learn from past mistakes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Interop is paramount.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't re-invent. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, this can be read on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2026/02/16/200908.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/116082170475263465&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2026/02/16/ideas-for-the-fediverse/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; and of course my feeds (and thus can be read in any app that supports inbound RSS).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

RSS is how you earn the &quot;web&quot; in your name. &quot;Web&quot; means something, it's just an intention, there are rules.&#10;*   You don't need &quot;open&quot; if you have &quot;web.&quot; The web is by definition open. Water is wet. Raises question re what the not-open web is. (Silo.)&#10;*   Support the basic features of text in the web. If you shut off the writing features of the web, as Twitter did, you're not really part of the web. Especially linking.&#10;*   Listen to users, listen to other developers.&#10;*   Automattic is doing heroic work connecting WordPress to ActivityPub. This means that WordPress APIs are now ActivityPub APIs. Not a small thing.&#10;*   Look at text coming out of WordPress into Mastodon, the HTML used definitely could be improved. Seems pretty simple things to fix, the simple things matter. Example: [WordPress version](https://daveverse.org/2026/02/16/new-rss-feature-from-manton/). [Mastodon version](https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/116080779314131849) of the same post. Let's make this beautiful!&#10;*   Keep trying fundamentally new architectures.&#10;*   Learn from past mistakes.&#10;*   Interop is paramount.&#10;*   Don't re-invent.&#10;&#10;BTW, this can be read on my [blog](http://scripting.com/2026/02/16/200908.html), on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/116082170475263465), in [WordPress](https://daveverse.org/2026/02/16/ideas-for-the-fediverse/) and of course my feeds (and thus can be read in any app that supports inbound RSS).</source:markdown>

Every once in a while I get reports from people who looked something up on my blog's &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=NaN&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; search engine saying that where they expected dates they see things like this: NaN. The reason you see that is that the archive has a mistake in it, where there was supposed to be a date there was something else. Usually I shrug it off, yes there are mistakes in the archive, 30+ years of OPML files, it's a miracle there aren't more errors. Then I realized since all this stuff is on GitHub, people could help with this, by instead of sending me the report, post a note on GitHub, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/350&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; -- saying you searched for this term and this is what I saw. Provide the term and a screen shot of what you saw. And then other people who have some extra time, could look through the archive, find the post, and then show me what needs to be fixed. I would then fix it, and over time the archive would get fixed. I posted a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/350&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the Scripting News repo, if you want to help, bookmark that link, and when you see an error, post the note and we can get going.</description>

I have no way of knowing if anyone has commented on them, but if there were a feed I'd add it to my blogroll. So it would be great to have a feed of all the comments on my posts on micro.blog. Would fit into my flow perfectly. This goes all the way back to the beginnings of RSS, where we called it &quot;automated web surfing.&quot; I don't know where people are talking about my stuff, but a well-placed feed can make up for that.</description>

			<description>Speaking of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/2076/back-button-functionality-how-important-is-it&quot;&gt;Back button&lt;/a&gt;, that's the problem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html&quot;&gt;tiny-little-text-box&lt;/a&gt; social networks. No links. So guess what the Back button one of the best inventions ever, isn't part of your reading and writing world. I guess this is like the street cars in LA &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy&quot;&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, that the car companies bought and shut down?</description>

Properly indenting it would make a big diff. I prefer encoding individual characters to CDATA. Those two things to start. It really does matter how readable this stuff is.

			<description>It's all-star weekend in the NBA which I've never seen the point of. As if sport is anything but a simulation of what we were born to do -- compete and cooperate. My team is great, your team sucks. It's fun the same way slapstick for some weird reason is funny. All it takes to get a laugh is trip and fall on your face. It's funny just thinking about it. Doesn't seem very nice but there it is.</description>

			<description>One more thing and then I gotta go. I think it's time for the AI's to compete with Wikipedia. It's filled with hallucinations. Make it a community thing, let the people be involved, but do a better job of presentation, and validate what's written, don't let these things become so territorial. We want the facts, not who has the best PR.</description>

When I first put them on and played something I had a jolt. The sound appeared to be blasting from the speaker on my laptop. I rushed to try to turn it down and realized it was in my head. Never been so impressed. They don't go inside your ear, the speaker is poised above the ear. Later when I got out of my car and the headphones automatically connected via Bluetooth -- it was a podcast -- I thought the person was talking to me on the street in the middle of nowhere. I laughed at now I had been tricked so thoroughly, twice. It keeps happening. Music is incredible. The best sound I've ever heard from headphones. So totally worth the money.</description>

One time I got a letter from my penpal with the usual stuff, school, sports, the Beatles, other kids, but this time there was no mention about how stupid the adults were. I found out why at the end in a PS. &quot;Sometimes my mom writes these for me.&quot; Obviously I never forgot this.</description>

			<description>I no longer even think of debating whether the AIs are intelligent. I might as well argue about your intelligence, or even my own. We have no idea what intelligence is or how to test for it. So if you think you're so intelligent and you say things like &quot;AIs aren't intelligent&quot; as if it were an indisputable fact, well I'm pretty sure that proves you are not actually very intelligent, which indicates how intelligent I am (not). And if you're worried about what happens if you stop insisting that AIs aren't intelligent, you can relax, nothing depends on what you or I or anyone else thinks about that, or pretty much anything. Have a nice day.</description>

Lots of takeaways, but this one will surprise you probably -- I think the AIs are our successors. We should at least try to preserve them so they can run on the Moon if we're in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction&quot;&gt;6th Mass Extinction&lt;/a&gt;, which of course we are.

So I told the story in a podcast and I think it came out really well. I did some editing at the beginning and end, and as usual my audio editing is pretty crude, but otherwise the story is exactly as I told it. I also asked Claude.ai to do a third-person summary of the podcast, as I did with the previous three shows, and it's getting better. I encourage anyone who's involved in the WordPress community to listen. I think WP has a bigger role to play in the web than it currently has, which imho is saying a lot. &lt;i&gt;15 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Heard an interview with Kamala Harris. She said they had 109 days to tell them who she is. Right there she highlighted the huge mistake the Dems make and continue to make. Ever since the advent of Twitter, campaigns have been every day of every year. The Dems have been AWOL. We never should have gotten to the summer of 2024 where people have no idea of who the freaking vice president is. When are they going to see how swept under the old ways of relating to voters are. The people are the government of the United States. Get behind us and let us work our magic.</description>

I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3mecvzafjss23&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of a dialog box with one of my snarky slogans. Dan Berlyoung thought the dialog was interesting. &quot;I kinda love that this is in a dialog box. One has to wonder what action on a computer would elicit this response.&quot; Man that's a great question. And that btw is what art is about. You put something in a dialog because that's the way it was presented by the software. I could have selected the text and put that into the tweet. But nahh, this is more interesting. And to answer the question Dan asks, in this specific case, the action that elicited this response was that I chose a placeholder command from a context menu in a piece of software that's a construction site, in other words it could have been any of the dozens of snarky slogans. Kind of reminds me of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/08/28/BeeSeason.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a long time ago where bees who were about to die reflect on the meaning of existence. Turns out it meant a lot less than one might think.</description>

			<description>Highly recommend the HBO two-part &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks:_The_99_Year_Old_Man!&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with and profile of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks&quot;&gt;Mel Brooks&lt;/a&gt; who was 99 years old when the interviews were done. Includes quotes from lots of famous comedians. And the philosophy of comedy as art. So many things to say. Why is physical humor the funniest? And the funniest of all the excerpts was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ARXuhoPsTc&quot;&gt;farting scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blazing-saddles/&quot;&gt;Blazing Saddles&lt;/a&gt;.
