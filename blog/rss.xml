What if the child doesn't live up to their expectations? Creating a new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full person starting at birth, and through their whole life, &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; an accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a functioning reproductive system. It's not anything to be proud or to expect to be rewarded or respected for.</description>

			<description>A note to anyone making a twitter-like system. If you supported outbound RSS, I could use your system as a note-taking tool. I know Bluesky does, and I should use it that way, but these days I'm more drawn to Threads, even though I know it's really Facebook under the covers.</description>

			<title>The NYT is weird</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events, and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists are taking with the system of government of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the context of who we are as a country, and what the Repubs do and say about the country, &quot;weird&quot; is pretty mild. What word would you prefer the Democrats use? Imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire&quot;&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, writing that column. (Safire was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63&quot;&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; btw.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term. This is where you get to speak out about what they're doing over there, and how it's not journalism. One of the rare things we agree with Trump on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a&quot;&gt;3 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Safire went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science&quot;&gt;Bronx Science&lt;/a&gt;! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers who aren't scared of tech stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today's so-called Republicans were weird. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I said on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that Biden's speech last Wednesday had the potential to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address&quot;&gt;Gettysburg&lt;/a&gt; address, if it the United States turns back toward democracy and government of the people, by the people and for the people. Biden has the potential of being as great a president as Lincoln. Let that settle in for a moment. I get goosebumps when I think about it. If he hadn't taken that stand, he could have become known as the US equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II#Life_in_exile&quot;&gt;Kaiser Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/podcast0/&quot;&gt;Podcast0&lt;/a&gt; project is teaching me how to read the archive of my own blog. Until now I had not carefully read the story I tell on my blog more than a few days after it happened. Here's I'm learning to reconstruct the summer of 2004, one of the most creative periods of my life, at least that's viewable in such a public and preserved way. Am I the first to do this for any blog? If you know of an example of historic research done using the archive of a blog, please send me a note. I'd love to learn about what you learned! Also because of its longevity and continuity, I offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; as some kind of record of what happened in the last 30 years or so. I see it as a complete work of writing, a kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco&quot;&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt; writing.</description>

			<title>Childless vs childful</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Notes accumulated during the day -- not in any particular order. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn't have such a solid line, and found that I couldn't have a personal life if I made it public. But now I want to reveal something. I am &quot;childless&quot; which is a term I find pretty insulting, as if being child&lt;i&gt;ful&lt;/i&gt; is the only normal state of being. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say -- bring it on. We should have this discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won't offer it unless asked, except this. If you have children, there's a good chance one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the same, and provide models of acceptance while they're growing up, by bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won't love them any less if they go down that path. And here's the hard part, imho, for people with children -- &lt;i&gt;keep that promise. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, people say it's seflish to not have children, but I don't agree, in fact I think it's the opposite. There was a point in human evolution where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation, but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where increasing human population worked against species survival. Our understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I bought an iPhone that I now don't need, and it's arriving today via FedEx. I wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and then return it. Obviously it's easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple's chatbot saw it as a &quot;technical&quot; question and wasn't prepared to help. Sales support is one of those applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling 1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn't find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.</description>

Now it isn't even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can't even reach it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I absolutely can't do this on my own. No time, patience, and it's not my job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source thing.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/07/27.html&quot;&gt;On this day in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, I did podcast interviews with &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/07/27/interviewWithDonMeans.html&quot;&gt;Don Means of Meetup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/07/27/interviewWithPattyWetterling.html&quot;&gt;Patty Wetterling of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.

The next 2004 podcast won't be until &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/08/15.html&quot;&gt;August 15&lt;/a&gt;. Banter with Adam Curry and Steve Gillmor probably about the podcasting bootstrap which at this point appears to be underway. Not sure if anyone as ever gone down this path in the last 20 years because, when I do the searches to find links to sites and people, I don't see any mention of this stuff in the current day, although now there will be (here in my blog archive). Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml&quot;&gt;the feed&lt;/a&gt; of ancient podcast review.

			<title>The NYT pulled another one</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/23/hopeKamala.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Somehow it's up to the Harris campaign to get the Trumps to have a normal American presidential campaign, not a prelude to a second attempted coup, which is what the Trumps are doing. I can see the op-ed they run in September saying that it's Harris's fault that the Trumps are fascist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/07/06.html#a135642&quot;&gt;reinstated&lt;/a&gt; my subscription because I need to actually read their words, not because they cover news, but because they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; news. The news is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate&quot;&gt;fourth estate&lt;/a&gt; in the US is gone. They have lost their minds. They aren't even trying. Their op-eds don't reflect facts, such as Trump will never be a serious candidate in the sense that the NYT thinks a candidate should be serious. The Democrats still will.

			<title>Google Recorder is what I wanted</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I lost my iPhone a few days ago. I think all the data is safe. First time I ever lost a phone. I ordered a new iPhone 15 Pro with 256GB, it will arrive on Monday hopefully. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I've needed to use my Android phone to record voice memos. Google's product is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;Recorder&lt;/a&gt;. It's just what I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://recorder.google.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't have to export your recording to get it where you need it to be, and it automatically does a transcript. There's an editor on the website, which again is exactly where I want it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A 2-minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/26/iTriedTheGoogleRecorderApp.m4a&quot;&gt;voice memo/podcast&lt;/a&gt; I recorded with the app.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I think the files are smaller?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/26/googleRecorderApp.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1816831709351977372&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; to Eric Raymond today, lightly edited here, following up on a thread that started in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/02/20.html&quot;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What Raymond &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;XML-RPC, in particular, is very much in the Unix spirit. It's deliberately minimalist but nevertheless quite powerful, offering a way for the vast majority of RPC applications that can get by on passing around boolean/integer/float/string datatypes to do their thing in a way that is lightweight and easy to to understand and monitor. This simple type ontology acts as a valuable check on interface complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's very true, my design goal for my whole 50+ year career has been to factor my code so well so it was as clean as Unix is, from top to bottom&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The virtue of relentless factoring is you can build higher if each layer of the stack lets through the functionality that's needed, and no more. Ideally there should be one way of doing something. and it should work pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realized that the web, RSS and podcasting are also a Unix-like things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because they can be made to do anything, but are  simple, not a lot to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But -- there's been this huge proliferation of languages and frameworks, and incredibly complex and underspecified formats. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile core functions like storage combined with identity for end users, has not been implemented, because of course if the users had their own networked data independent of any platform vendor there would be no lockin. that's 2024 version of the cathedral, to follow your analogy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, seeing you here made me think of this, I've wanted to say this to you for a long to you and now I have. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265&quot;&gt;2001 email&lt;/a&gt; from Eric Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We're at a huge fork in the road. One fork -- goodbye USA, the other way, we're stronger than ever. We're in a good spot imho because Trump's tank is empty. He's old, tired, fat, addled, fetid, rotten. You have to work really hard not to see that. If it works, Biden will have stabilized the country, and Harris will erect the guardrails that make sure no one follows in Trump's path, and the Supreme Court gets back into its proper place. They've been overthrowing our society, economy and political system. That all has to be reversed before it does too much damage, and prevented in the future. I want to know why the court can't be expanded, and if Harris will put that in her platform.</description>

			<description>I want a Masto-clone that does not do replies. You can't insert anything under my idea, but you can if you like include my idea, as a link, in yours. This model works. I think by now we know the other way does not work. BTW I use the term Masto-clone interchangeably with Twitter-like. Let's spread the love around.</description>

			<description>Software-wise I realized recently that everything that takes me away from creating really nice writing and publishing tools is a waste. I have to get off track because there are huge holes in the web as a runtime platform. And every year it gets worse as new incompatible languages are added, new incompatible stacks built. As a result we have to re-do everything all the time, and never get a chance to create new user experience. The market fragments, which is exactly what the tech companies want. It keeps their products from becoming commodities. And like it or not, the politicians and corporations don't want us writing too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about things they don't care about.</description>

And like it or not, the politicians and corporations don't want us writing too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about things they don't care about." created="Thu, 25 Jul 2024 19:23:11 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html#a192311"/>

			<description>Fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/live/harris-biden-trump-election-campaign-updates&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; by President Biden. It's good we'll have both a president and a campaign and that they'll be separate thing. I look forward to reading it slowly. And he put a cap on the awful communication of the last month, he took control of the story from the snobs and shit throwers in the press.</description>

This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lover-elon-musk-already-145940678.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; says that Musk is rate-limiting followers on that account.  Of course we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; what could happen if a Republican bought twitter, but I didn't honestly contemplate that a fascist would. These days our greatest fears aren't scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh. BTW, if you want to know why we're so thrilled to have Harris as the candidate, even though we didn't want Joe to give in, it's because no informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it). Today it's the hope that we won't be deported or worse.</description>

			<description>All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem what they have to say about that. But the reporter &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; what the Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don't care if we know.</description>

			<title>Podcast starts with linkblogging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what we put on the wire over the social web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from algol-like and lisp-like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I talk about what made Unix so great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eric Raymond once told me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and the rest. Huge compliment because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the big picture. We shouldn't give them so much power, they pretend they know, but they are usually pretty clueless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours every day, and string those days together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt. Those are the hardest projects, I'm doing one of those right now, but in the end it's worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm doing something new. Trying to initiate topics on the social web. We almost totally respond to external stuff, I wonder how different it would be if we engaged on a more individual level. I've been doing this for a while, but only now am able to explain it.</description>

			<title>I'm from Queens too</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the same part of Queens as Trump, about ten years after he did. His family was in Jamaica, mine in Flushing. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/2931+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/85-15+Wareham+Pl,+Jamaica,+NY+11432/@40.74413,-73.7982607,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2611ad4d2c6a5:0xfe60c1b9262c3e04!2m2!1d-73.7858048!2d40.7170409!3e0?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway&quot;&gt;Utopia Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. A great name for a street, but it's not a parkway and it's nice but definitely not a utopia.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who aren't from huge cities like New York don't know that Trump what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I think that's where 99% of the confusion is. They really don't believe he's so bad. Don't hold that against them, that's nowhere near as bad as knowing what he is and being okay with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don't believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming&quot;&gt;body shaming&lt;/a&gt;, because I care about other people's feelings. If I criticize his appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type who may not be mean bully losers like Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's also a really good comedian if you don't think he wants to have the power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that's the mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole that would have been hard to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt, and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don't like a candidate vote against them don't shoot them. That's American and it's not fascist at all. I don't think they know that he wants to make big changes in how our politics work. People think if he's bad they can just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn't seem to register. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Do Trump supporters understand what they support?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump's followers are deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6 and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They're already doing it via the Supreme Court. It's going to get a lot worse if we go the wrong way. We shouldn't accept that we're horribly divided. The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don't know why and I don't care, I just know they do, based on their actions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I know we're at a high moment, we're excited, and I'm going to enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on &quot;our side&quot; but I hold out hope that being an American still means something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work together. I think that's still our greatest challange and our greatest opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think most of us do no matter who you vote for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're driving us into the arms of the Nazis. Who knows why, or even if there is a reason, other than their drive to find meaning in their great wealth. Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the money they've accumulated. These are not human-size fortunes, playing a game of make-believe, what if we really were as smart as we think our money says we are. Well you ain't that smart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
