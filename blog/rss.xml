They're trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking with a few hundred. So they read each others' work, and try not to be too far off the consensus. It's at best an art, at worst they're just press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain directions. Don't overlook that the money is flowing to the same businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but there at least there's objective news to report on, you know -- the score of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded. In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the journalists we have don't report it. There's a lot of inputs that are connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/241102/p54#a241102p54&quot;&gt;top item&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/03/iowapoll.png&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt; is about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/&quot;&gt;poll in Iowa&lt;/a&gt; that says Harris is ahead. Iowa was never thought to be in play. Yes, I too am addicted. Endlessly fascinated. Maybe we'll survive next week after all? Hope.</description>

			<title>Could a Musk buy Bluesky?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at will.&quot; It's a good practice, and while I completely support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community, and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that their pitch is a scam, and they're building value in a user base that they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the founders may have already sold some of their stock in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a&quot;&gt;latest investment round&lt;/a&gt; which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they're open, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the only way to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; do it is to &quot;provide a download that you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of confusion.&quot; (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too much into their promise of being open.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw had an open API too, and it's pretty good, but they never offered the option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else build one of those? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In early 2017 I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a president. This value wasn't on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it could possibly gain him control of part of the US government's $6 trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each sale. He could probably start borrowing against it the day after the election is called for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it's possible they have a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that's why it's a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would sell out even if they didn't have to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People may question my credentials as a language designer. I've designed a very innovative system that unfortunately the academics don't think is worth studying. It's utterly ridiculous. Who says you can only learn from systems developed at big companies or universities. I cover a lot of ground, it's true -- no one gave me permission to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn't feel I needed permission. Or funding for that matter. I think what happened is Apple positioned us as less significant than their system scripting language, and people just accepted that, when Frontier is a far superior system. Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier&quot;&gt;ideas are there&lt;/a&gt; anyway, and you're welcome to learn from them.</description>

			<title>My friend who I don't understand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most depressing thing last night for me was reading that a longtime friend voted for the worst candidate they've ever voted for because the other one was worse. They wouldn’t say who they actually voted for. This is what we’ll be left with as a country when all this is done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave another $100 to Harris to compensate, and of course voted straight Democratic on Thursday. Unlike my friend I was proud to vote for her. The alternative, after what we lived through between 2017 and 2021, to choose to go through that again, hard to imagine the horror.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course that’s assuming he voted for Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="The most depressing thing last night for me was reading that a longtime friend voted for the worst candidate they've ever voted for because the other one was worse. They wouldn’t say who they actually voted for. This is what we’ll be left with as a country when all this is done." created="Sat, 02 Nov 2024 14:53:46 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02/145335.html#a145346"/>
				<source:outline text="I gave another $100 to Harris to compensate, and of course voted straight Democratic on Thursday. Unlike my friend I was proud to vote for her. The alternative, after what we lived through between 2017 and 2021, to choose to go through that again, hard to imagine the horror." created="Sat, 02 Nov 2024 14:54:13 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/11/02/145335.html#a145413"/>

			<description>Unfortunately the only place you can read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/pfbid0VqEwJyLQQ7Qyhu9Zoz6ivz35APRfvLMKp7wBZvR2pDRTVdLwf1QR8Xh646faRJ1Zl&quot;&gt;Dan Conover piece&lt;/a&gt; is on Facebook about the failure of the NY Times and Washington Post to adequately defend democracy. He says something I had not seen elsewhere. &quot;We're not talking about HuffPo or Salon here. We're talking about the last two 'unique nationals' standing in American print journalism. Institutions with long and storied histories. Both took the same test at the same time, and both failed it.&quot; I'd add that all other journalism usually follows their lead, but that may be finally changing.</description>

			<description>Meanwhile, it's amazing that both CNN and MSNBC have gotten serious about covering the reality of Trump 2.0 after being very unserious for the last year. It's as if after rejecting Joe Biden, months later they realized they rejected the wrong guy.</description>

We think the Democrats are the opposite, they are inclusive, everyone is welcome there. But that's not true. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5154873/what-explains-the-big-gender-gap-between-supporters-of-trump-and-harris&quot;&gt;NPR piece&lt;/a&gt; touches on it, gingerly, because it's the third rail in non-Republican politics. Because it's one of the divisions that's maintained by people who are mostly Democrats. If you want to know if you're part of the problem, measure your own feelings when you find out what it's about. And then listen, carefully to the words. It might be hard to hear because I think most people who do this don't think they do, or they're justified in doing it. They don't want to look here. But the pragmatic reason to focus on this is that in future elections, assuming we have them, if we can make an effort to not do this, we could get enough Republican votes to switch to make real change possible. They might even become our most vocal supporters. Winning in politics is done by focusing on common interests over division.</description>
