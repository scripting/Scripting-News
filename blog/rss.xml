			<description>I have a server that's returning &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; files. It's not the first time I've done this, but now there seem to be enough other people interested in this that it's worth raising this question. What content type should I use. Generally I've been using text/xml. But I see other people using text/opml. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opml.org/issues/20&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>One place I could use ChatGPT-like functionality, in debugging CSS. I'd like to put my cursor on an object in Elements view and ask why does this object have a width of 1054.09px. When I look it up in the Computed panel it's greyed out, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to get the debugger to explain this. But there is an answer to this question.</description>

			<title>Spoiler for The Jinx</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning if you haven't watched the second season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jinx_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Jinx&lt;/a&gt; you should not read this, because it's a total spoiler. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Durst is cross-examined in the trial, the prosecutor asks a series of questions that got him to admit that if he had actually killed his first wife, he would have lied in his testimony. He asked a whole bunch of things but stopped short of asking the question that would have nailed him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mr Durst, would you kill someone to avoid being convicted of killing your wife?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From what we know of Durst he would have had a hard time saying no. When he's caught he generally admits he's caught. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They got the conviction anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I don't recommend either season but having watched the first, I was kind of committed to watching the second. He's a truly despicable character. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I don't think anyone is listening, but my issue with the Times is when they embrace and promote conspiracy theories that damage our political system. Matt says we have many truths, and I think that's where we differ, there has to be one truth when it comes to accusations of the kind that the Repubs throw at Democratic candidates and minorities. When they take a side against the people, that's when I have a problem.</description>

			<title>A great political ad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay it's not the best political ad ever but it's pretty freaking good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We love America and the flag stands for the good in us, in all of us. And our president not only gets that, he is doing what presidents are supposed to do, unite us. To the extent that we can at this time be united. But even a MAGA, viewing this ad, is going to have to swell up with pride for what this country means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VC2SshZ373M?si=CV1-O9liPDmIhQRN&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I have a question for my campaign friend and politics rabbi -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/that-trippi-show/id1523896927&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. Joe, why don't they ask for a contribution at the end? I'd pay money specifically to have that ad run everywhere, even in states we have no chance of winning. Because there are people in every state that deserve encouragement, and if we want to really win we need them to feel part of our great country as much as anyone in a swing state. And there's always value in forcing the opposition to campaign in states they otherwise feel are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So let me -- a regular citizen -- earmark a contribution for &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; message. It gives me another way to vote, a sense I'm participating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription lists&lt;/a&gt; back in the 00s that it included the &lt;i&gt;htmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute, it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I'm using a SQL database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I thought &quot;no big deal&quot; it's a variant of a SQL table I've now done a dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I've yet to come up with a way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at runtime. That's how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be factored. This probably doesn't make sense to too many people, maybe it won't even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I've moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I'm sure it's possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of them, which is why I'm taking my break from &lt;i&gt;The Next Product&lt;/i&gt; to do this.</description>

			<source:outline text="I'm working on a server app to read blogroll source in OPML, and build a database of other blogrolls that are linked to feeds in the original blogroll, accessed via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/blogroll.opml&quot;&gt;feed or html source&lt;/a&gt;. It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription lists&lt;/a&gt; back in the 00s that it included the &lt;i&gt;htmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute, it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I'm using a SQL database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I thought &quot;no big deal&quot; it's a variant of a SQL table I've now done a dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I've yet to come up with a way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at runtime. That's how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps.

			<description>It's not much of a secret that my next product is the minimal writing tool I always felt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wordpress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; should have. I have not been doing this in conjunction with Automattic, I'm not sure we're on the same planet re what WordPress is for. Ultimately it'll be their decision if this idea gains traction. But I keep hearing people ask for this product, and I think it's the reason Substack and Ghost have become popular. I'm going to put it out there, and see what comes back. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, I love the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png&quot;&gt;margin image&lt;/a&gt; of NakedJen. Talking with her the other day we decided this would be the opening scene of The NakedJen Movie. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xqiu0ekahw&quot;&gt;meaning&lt;/a&gt; of the image is well-known to people who travel with the Dead, as Jen did. I've never been to a Dead concert with her, but I understand it's like going to a Comdex or MacWorld in the 80s or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricklin.com/albums/pcforum99/&quot;&gt;Esther's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/digerati/alsop/&quot;&gt;Stewart's&lt;/a&gt; conferences for me in the 90s. Sure you go for the music, but &lt;i&gt;mainly&lt;/i&gt; you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;schmooze&lt;/a&gt; in the hallways. I love talking with her on the phone the most. We have thought about doing a podcast, and even tried recording one, but our one-to-one conversations are much more interesting, and funny. We're take turns being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain&quot;&gt;Pinky or the Brain&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Why Google should know my blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did a search on my site for NakedJen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google thinks I meant &quot;Naked Men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why Google should know I have a blog and it has it indexed, and if it just looks it would know that question shows how &lt;b&gt;dumb&lt;/b&gt; it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I type my mother's name in, searching on my own blog (again) it tries to correct the spelling of her name. My own mother's name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google started out so smart then they must have lost all the smart people. Or they got stupid? I don't know. But there's so much they could do to improve their product, it would be sensible to, while they're shooting for the fences, do the small things that would give users an idea that there's &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; humanity to the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/13/nakedJenOrNakedMen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;NakedJen or &quot;Naked Men.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: ChatGPT should also know where my blog is, and it should be constantly loading the updates.

I copy the result, paste it into MySQL and I'm back on the road. One can imagine where they build that into the MySQL app and I converse with it instead of the app with the awful error messages.</description>

My grandfather told me what to do, but I won't do it, pretty sure of that." created="Tue, 11 Jun 2024 13:47:13 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2024/06/11.html#a134713"/>

			<description>The real story of RSS is that in a moment when the NYT had a spirit of adventure, they backed RSS and as a result news adopted a technology that was pioneered by bloggers, not the tech industry. If that partnership had flourished and developed we might now have a good alternative to the tech billionaires.</description>

			<description>And before that a few oddly empowered crazy-ass people at Netscape had an idea that bloggers had the answer, not Google. I don't really know who they were, they communicated through their actions, not via email or the phone.

It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups&quot;&gt;beaucoups&lt;/a&gt; money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I started replying to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746&quot;&gt;post by Tim Bray&lt;/a&gt; in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character limit, so I moved my act over here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It often only represents a story from one point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the story of RSS. I'm sure you know the story they tell, but there's a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and  Motley Fool, and eventually brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you'd get the idea that the bigco's heroically fought back against what exactly it's not clear. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well it's not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it on my blog (as I'm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is. (Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT made a mistake like that people would be howling. I'm sure Wikipedia is filled with junk like that. Why wouldn't it be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while other sources don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the open web. I don't know why it's better at finding stuff, and also understanding my queries even though they're not rigorously specified, my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which of course they are being. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that's a big difference between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very impatient with them and move on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I'm not here to debate. I don't like online debates. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of relationships.</description>

			<description>I find I look for new stuff in the social web the way I used to look for new stuff on news websites before we got RSS and feed readers. It made a little sense when it was only Twitter. But now I have to check Bluesky, Mastodon and Threads too. It's not just the writing that has to be distributed manually, but also our time as readers. And then there's the question of where you reply if you have something to add.</description>

			<description>If you and I both have accounts on ChatGPT, it would be nice if I could include you in one of my conversations with the bot, and we could explore an idea together with access to all the information we might want to call up. This is what all the chat companies are trying, but the one in the best position to do this is OpenAI, because they have the top rung in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samples.jbpub.com/9781449622213/Chapter19.pdf&quot;&gt;positioning ladder&lt;/a&gt; for AI apps. It's where most of us go for our AI. Like Visicalc which had the top rung of the spreadsheet ladder until Lotus 1-2-3 took over, which was then knocked off the top rung by Excel. This is why they have to move forward aggressively, it's the way tech works. Before too long all the chat apps with have their AI bots in the loop and it will be too late for OpenAI to dominate. But right now they are the obvious choice for this. The place &lt;s&gt;you&lt;/s&gt; &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; go to AI.</description>

I could show it what wasn't working with a screen shot. Amazingly it understood and made the connection to the software we were working on, and suggested a modification that made it work properly. This was an important missing bit of functionality, previously you had to explain in words what wasn't working visually. That worked too, but was cumbersome. Much easier to just show it was wrong. And the UI couldn't be simpler. Take the screen shot at paste it into the box where you normally type. It starts analyzing before you press Enter.</description>

			<description>Jon Stewart from this Monday is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmxzQJt80XI&quot;&gt;good to watch&lt;/a&gt; as a reminder of what the press could be doing beyond what Jay Rosen recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice. (Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1798365545106141236&quot;&gt;Jay is on it&lt;/a&gt;.)</description>
