			<description>Perhaps I should add a new element to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;, the name of the author of a blog, if the feed is for a blog. Here's why I need it. I am building my blogroll. Every time I find an insightful story about using tech I use, these days esp AI, I add it to my blogroll so I get to see any new articles they write when they post. But if their blog has a catchy name, I'll never pick it out of the list as I scan for something new to read. I need the name of the author too. Basically a blogger should provide their name, but of course it's completely optional. I'll subscribe anyway, if the article is on-topic. I'm soaking this stuff up now, building my own personal firehose.</description>

			<title>Tech is about people</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Once again we're at the beginning of a huge tech-induced transformation, and yet again the people who already occupy a high rung of the ladder of success, or imagine they do, are pissing all over it, without using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kvell&quot;&gt;kvelling&lt;/a&gt; about Napster, about how the ability to program my own music had made it possible for me to explore my own life in new ways, because music is inexorably bound to memory. For me the big revelation came on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/06/18.html&quot;&gt;Father's Day in 2000&lt;/a&gt; when I heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk&quot;&gt;Father and Son&lt;/a&gt; by Cat Stevens on the radio and desperately wanted to hear it again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had tried Napster a few months earlier and found that it had none of my music. It was basically just a technology demo. I tried it again, and this time not only did it have the Cat Stevens song, but it had every song from my childhood that I hadn't heard since being a kid listening to WABC on the transistor radio my grandfather gave me for my birthday when I was five or six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I told this story at a Future of Music conference and was torn apart by the other people on stage, supposedly creative people, who cared not one bit about how people used the product they created, and the power of being able to program our own music. They were the bosses of music and my job was merely to give them money and admiration and stfu. They tried to get me off the stage (I was the moderator) but I stood my ground and of course never forgot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened again a few years later at the DNC in Boston, when the journalists mocked the bloggers because we had no experience as journalists, and they didn't like the way we dressed (they wrote articles about it, in the NYT even). 20+ years later they're still complaining, but they forget to blame us for their misery, now. Their misery is they forget the glory of their job, which is empowering us -- their users -- to change the world that so desperately needs changing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's happening again with AI, which is opening up creative expression to people who can't draw, or aren't good writers, or people who want to be better programmers, or who knows -- this technology is the most powerful I've used in my long life in tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The difference is -- you have to use something before your criticism makes any sense. That was the mistake the music industry made with Napster. What the journalists made regarding bloggers (we're they're sources, tried to say over and over but they don't listen they just like to talk and be admired and our job as usual is to give them money and stfu). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My very good friend Doc Searls sees it the same way. He calls it &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/28/the-peoples-ai/&quot;&gt;People's AI&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to build this out the way we did it with blogging and podcasting a few years ago. It may be our last rodeo, we're getting on in years, but I'm so glad I lived to see this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Sidebar: The people who run tech companies today have no idea how to build new technology markets, the categories they occupy were built by others, now gone. I finally figured that's our disconnect and why products lose important features when they are taken over by the inheritors, and why the leaders of Google et al have no idea where to put AI for users to build with it, or even that the users build the stuff they use in tech. Say what you want about Jack, Ev and Biz, but they understood this idea and they did let the users lead.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, don't miss that it was twelve of us, twelve people, that finally said what the ladder-occupiers have failed to say for far too long about Trump -- he's a felon. We've known that, but when did Obama, Biden, Moscow Mitch or anyone else with a name or reputation to protect say the most obvious truth. They're all powerless and weak, and if we want to get out of this mess we're going to have to lead ourselves. Waiting for them, that didn't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Thanks to Twitter for increasing the character limit, so I can &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1796516437281935415&quot;&gt;write my blog posts&lt;/a&gt; on my iPad before starting my day. Like this. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: BTW -- here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk&quot;&gt;the song&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow the music industry survived my ability to share this song with you and my future self.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I write these pieces with specific people in mind but I rarely say who they are because it embarrasses them. But I write &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; my pieces the my regular readers, who keep me going, almost 30 years (on Oct 10 this year). I hope they build great things with these ideas, and they let me help them do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPS: Doc tends to write brilliant pieces that perfectly describe these points in time. Let's travel back to 1997, as Steve Jobs is returning to Apple, when &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;Doc explained&lt;/a&gt; that while he loves me, Steve loves no one but Steve. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPPS: The motto for the podcasting community as it was booting up in 2004 was &quot;users and developers party together.&quot; That was the thing that Adam and I agreed on. Adam being the user, and I being the developer. Of course it was his trying to be a developer, and me trying to be a user that was the spark that created the boom. We both made it safe for amateurs to do what we do. That's why podcasting, unlike the music industry, never went to war with its users.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The best humor is about other people being stupid, evil, clumsy or their misfortune. Watch a SNL skit. It's not about people being smart or brave, kind, generous or otherwise wonderful. That's another kind of entertainment. We find the misfortune of others funny. Especially famous, successful people. Why? I have no idea.</description>

			<title>Biden: Why isn't Trump in jail?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Biden would be a fine president if our problems were limited to the virus, the economy and climate change. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's like Obama, but with much more experience at getting things done in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His failure is that the fascist movement in the country is much stronger now than it was when he took office. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are we better off than we were four years ago? No, sadly we are worse off. Trump is a much bigger threat now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden is a fine LBJ-like president. And like LBJ, he has his Vietnam. Biden's war he can't end is called Trump. Trump isn't in jail. That's the failure right there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem could be fixed if we had this discussion out in the open, so that the press raises it every day and in every press event. They shouldn't be trying to embarrass him about his age, that's rude and deceptive, instead they should ask why isn't Trump in jail?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Biden wanted to address this, and it would certainly help his chances of winning, he would:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fire Garland immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Apologize for not firing him sooner. It was a mistake. My mistake. I own it. I am sorry.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nominate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin&quot;&gt;Jamie Raskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego&quot;&gt;Ruben Gallego&lt;/a&gt; as the new AG.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden's number one promise is that he will &lt;i&gt;fully&lt;/i&gt; prosecute Trump and all insurrectionists in his second term, starting now. This would also serve as a warning to any Trump supporters that tried to overthrow the government (again, sigh) before or during the election. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump is making a fool of Biden by saying openly that he will be a dictator on Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think Trump is losing don't get it. People are rightly fed up with Biden. But not for the economy. That's bullshit. And not because he's old. Rather because he's selling us out, just hoping against hope that the voters will save us. It's kind of unreasonable to expect that when you, the person we elected president to get us out of this hole, didn't fire the biggest obstacle to our starting to dig. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Depend on Congress, the press, the courts, now the voters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No Biden, you're the president. This is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/10/29/lockHimUp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>How can we tell if ChatGPT is intelligent? How can I tell if you're intelligent. How do I know I'm intelligent. It could be my &quot;intelligence&quot; is as algorithmic as ChatGPT's. It could be that my intelligence is only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation&quot;&gt;survival mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, and the only way I could think of something I think is intelligent is if it furthers my chance to reproduce. But what happens when our intellect instructs us to destroy the environment we depend on for life? It could be we are already obsolete, without the robots, it sure feels that way, and that our only &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark&quot;&gt;ark&lt;/a&gt; that could lead us to a new place where our species can survive in some form is for us to morph into electronic beings whose intelligence is distributed around the planet so we don't die if it becomes uninhabitable in one place, but not in others. And a LLM might thrive in an environment that can't support human life.</description>

My answer as a former teaching assistant who graded lots of student programs, absolutely. It rivals the intellect of every human being I know, including professors. It hasn't learned yet how to synthesize new ideas, it seems. And there are strong guardrails that keep it from going into certain areas. It is more capable than we know, therefore. BTW, I didn't realize he teaches at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University&quot;&gt;Tulane&lt;/a&gt;. I got my undergraduate degree there in 1976.</description>

			<description>Here's a problem I have with the ChatGPT app. I can't find the conversations I had with it a month ago. And I need to. They desperately need a Bookmarks menu. I'm sure their corporate customers are screaming about this, because they need groupware too. Are they partnering with Slack, or is Slack doing their own, for example?</description>

			<description>Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc should collaborate on new ways to do software docs and user interaction using AI. It's an incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are to people, and the only people whose writing is ingested are employees of the companies. Not only will it increase utility, it will demonstrate in a very observable way how transformational the technology is. Probably will do nice things for the value of the stock too.</description>

Every day I'm trying to do it myself and encourage others to as well. Explain things we can do now that weren't approachable before. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/25/howIUsedChatGptThisMorning.m4a&quot;&gt;15 minute report&lt;/a&gt; about this just now. I had to debug a complicated new configuration, setting up a new server with new code on both ends to implement a secure websocket connection. I've done it a dozen times, and you always make at least one mistake, and have to find it, and you need a checklist to go through, systematically, to find the problem, and it's really cool that ChatGPT can synthesize the checklist and give you instructions on tools that make it easy. There could never be anything like this on a Google/Stack Exchange type support system. It simply wasn't possible a year ago. We really need this story to get out too, but now it's all about how AI is a hoax. It is not. Yes Silicon Valley is run by monsters, doing basically the best they can. Riding a wave like this is thrilling but also you can't win on a personal level these days. It used to be the other way, you couldn't lose. They put the czars of tech on the covers of magazines and praised them as genius, godlike humans living at a much more elevated level than all of us schnooks, if you were one of the blessed. And always ignored are &lt;i&gt;the freaking users,&lt;/i&gt; which is where the actual revolution is taking place. Too much work for the journalists, I guess? I would think if you were reporting in a time when new uses of technology are being discovered daily, real ones, transformative ones, you'd want to be in on that story. Nope I guess you don't get a Pulitzer these days for reporting news, just for finding hypocrisy, which is always in great supply, real or imagined. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>As you may know, over the years I extend &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; by adding elements to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1716308936000&quot;&gt;source:self&lt;/a&gt; whose value is the canonical URL for the feed. This was a useful addition in Atom, which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md#61522-by-dw----v049&quot;&gt;supported&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/README.md&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, and I wanted to include the value without having to add another namespace to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt; and feeds produced by my products, so reallySimple now supports both. Small move forward for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>There's this great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mzY1sdiFSU&amp;t=53s&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; in MoneyBall where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane&quot;&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/a&gt; is talking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Justice&quot;&gt;David Justice&lt;/a&gt; in the batting cage. Justice reminds Beane how much he's paying him, and Beane says I'm going to tell it to you straight -- half your salary is being paid by the Yankees. Think about it. They're paying all that money for you to play &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; them. That's how I feel about Fox. How much will it cost to get them to STFU. Whatever it is it's worth it.</description>

			<description>If you're part of the indieweb community and work in Node.js, you should know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple package&lt;/a&gt;. It flattens the interface for the most common feed formats. It's designed to be super easy to use. Give it a URL and it returns a consistent JSON structure. More people would develop feed-using apps if they knew about this package. I just want more people to develop around feeds.</description>

I thought for sure as soon as the ideas were out they'd take off. But most people had no idea. Most big new ideas come out of developers realizing something new is possible, shipping it, refining it and getting lucky. AI is the next one, I'm absolutely sure of it. But most people, even most developers, don't see the need, don't see it as inevitable in a good way. To make a fine point, we don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; AI, we didn't need PCs or GUIs or the web. But once the masses saw the power, fun and utility, there was no turning back. The same is true of AI. I've been trying to puzzle out how this will go. How can we develop the amazing power and depth of knowledge of the machine combined with the creativity and deep yearning of humans. One thing I've learned from the year I've been doing this as a user, the machine doesn't want to do anything. Don't anthropomorphize it that way. Try having a conversation with it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/cb9c4c97-bb20-439e-a503-ed2356403b0c&quot;&gt;ask what it wants&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't understand the concept. It's not surprising that we think the machine will be like us, we always want something, we're the most selfish species there is. But we'll learn to work with the machine, I already have. We'll &lt;i&gt;evolve&lt;/i&gt; through this. That's maybe the biggest strength our species has, the rate at which we can adapt.</description>

However, as always the most interesting stuff is done by the users, especially at such an early stage in a technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past, when blogging was booting up, we had blogging itself to share information about what we were learning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcasting grew even more quickly because we already had blogging to share info on what we were trying, what worked, and what didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see all of it in the archive of Scripting News. I was liberal about what I pointed to, because sharing the ideas was more important than any one person's ideas, including my own. The downside is that it made it easy for people to claim credit for things they didn't contribute. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway with AI, I'm just using the stuff, not developing with it, at least not yet. I wouldn't know where to begin. But I'm discovering all kinds of applications every day, and writing about them on my blog, but I know there are many others doing the same, and I want to read all of it and want them to read my stuff. There's no way to find each other right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sidebar: It would be interesting to have an AI server that was ingesting our RSS feeds all the time. Then a community of bloggers, if it should develop would have a totally unique kind of archive. Who knows what we'd learn? Would anyone need to write a book about this stuff, or would we always have a current book about what's been discovered here? If you find this fascinating as I do, then I want to know more about what you're doing. See how we can bootstrap something in itself, that's the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, when I discover a blogger who is writing about using AI, I'll add it to my blogroll, which is visible on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogroll.social/&quot;&gt;blogroll.social&lt;/a&gt; main page, and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. If you have such a blog, or know of a good one, send me a link, and I'll add it to the blogroll. Once there are enough, I'll start a public timeline for it in FeedLand, so everyone can benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's use our technology to track the most exciting tech development in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt; for the third time. One of the major themes of the show is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons&quot;&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt; that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.</description>

			<description>Has anyone ever asked you, on the social web, what you think about something? Not a message to everyone to which you could reply, but a message specifically to you? I try to do it when I think of it. I find you can get really interesting ideas that way sometimes. And also it's a way spreading some love around the world, because people like to be asked what they think, I've found.</description>

			<description>I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks. I knew all the players. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin&quot;&gt;Obi Toppin&lt;/a&gt;, a former Knick we traded for some reason. That's about it for my inner fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result when I got up in the morning. That's how I like my NBA, frankly.</description>

An iPad was like a magazine, but what would you tell a young person who never used a magazine? What is it? Right now almost everyone is looking at AI from the point of view of a world with no AI. And it turns out that once you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start playing and you find all kinds of amazing things. But if you don't try it, you'll always be looking at it from the past. We've seen this kind of explosive growth in the power of the individual human. It's a 20-minute podcast and I'm all over the map, but it's good stuff, imho of course. YMMV, my mother loves me, I am not a lawyer.</description>

			<description>I found a fairly painless way to transcribe voicemails using Google Docs. 1. Open a text document. 2. Choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en&quot;&gt;Voice Typing&lt;/a&gt; from the Tools menu. 3. Play the voice memo over the speaker of your iPhone. 4. That's it. Google transcribes it into your document. It would be better if Apple offered that as an option in the Share menu, but they don't.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Here's what I've learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla&quot;&gt;owing&lt;/a&gt; a Tesla Model Y with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html&quot;&gt;Full Self Driving&lt;/a&gt;. I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as &quot;self-driving,&quot; which it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9&quot;&gt;Kia EV9&lt;/a&gt;, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romeokia.com/&quot;&gt;Kia dealer&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York&quot;&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt; which is practically in the neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Don't miss that Twitter has become a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/20/193616.html&quot;&gt;blogging platform&lt;/a&gt;. It's sad that it took this long.

			<title>A post I wrote on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext. Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. &quot;show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.&quot; Like that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

It should be as easy to block someone as it is to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.</description>
