			<description>Molly White&amp;#39;s OPML subscription list for blogs. Let&amp;#39;s start a thing where influencers share their lists, and lets get the feed reader devs let us subscribe to the OPML, so the subscriptions are dynamic. Not hard to implement.</description>

			<description>This is the OPML list of podcasts I follow. I keep it updated when I add or remove feeds. You are welcome to use this list, I publish it because I want to bootstrap this practice, of influencers sharing lists of podcasts they recommend. We can make this happen folks. Bootstrapping works.</description>
