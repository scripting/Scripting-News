			<description>Bloggers, here&amp;#39;s an idea. When you write a piece you&amp;#39;re proud of, end it with a sentence like this: &amp;quot;And that&amp;#39;s why I have a blog.&amp;quot; It plants a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We&amp;#39;ve had a lot of mud slung at us, let&amp;#39;s start undoing it.</description>
