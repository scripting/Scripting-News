			<description>This is an item in my Mastodon timeline that I posted in WordPress via ActivityPub. I did nothing but turn the feature on in a dialog box. Since WordPress itself is highly scriptable, it now can act as an &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; gateway to the Fediverse. The only thing they aren&amp;#39;t doing that the others do is hyping it up (cough Ghost cough). 😀</description>

			<description>1995: Eudora was a central piece of technology to the bootstrap of blogging. It&amp;#39;s always like that, it starts out as an experiment to see what&amp;#39;s possible, and in this case, a lot was possible. I don&amp;#39;t know if it was open source, but it was brilliant and risky and made it all possible w/o going through gatekeepers.</description>

			<description>A comment from thirty years of blogging. &amp;quot;Blogging seems kind of lost, and I would like to see that change. Every time you post something you&amp;#39;re proud of on a social media site, take a moment to post it to your blog. And, if appropriate, link to something in your blog post, even though the social media sites don&amp;#39;t support linking, the web is still here and it still does.&amp;quot;</description>
