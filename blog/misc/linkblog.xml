			<description>Highly recommend this New Yorker podcast episode to understand why political reporters are so out of step with the people who read their stuff. They are unable to be revulsed by the things Trump says. Listen to it the way we listen to Trump supporters in Ohio diners. They are a foreign culture. That&amp;#39;s not good.</description>
