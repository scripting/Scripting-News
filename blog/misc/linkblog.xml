			<description>Can you believe Bluesky could have built their system on http and rss. If it really works, what a response to ActivityPub. We’d be years ahead of where we are now.

			<description>The press has no power over Trump, he went around them going directly to the people through Twitter. Musk observed this, bought Twitter, for which his ROI will be huge. The Dems ignored this, and played the political game as if Twitter never happened. For Trump it was an accident, but not for Musk, he knew exactly what he was doing.</description>
