			<description>A couple of years ago I begged Elie Mystal to make the abortion chapter of his wonderful book available publicly for free, because it explained the implications of Dobbs so incredibly well and uniquely.

			<description>A couple of weeks ago I wouldn’t have written this piece for fear of having my life ruined. Now it makes sense to explain why so many men voted for Trump, imho mistakenly, because they were driven away by fear of men.

			<description>The Dems stopped campaigning against Trump after winning the 2020 election and Trump never stopped. They failed to even see this.
