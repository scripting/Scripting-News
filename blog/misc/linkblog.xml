			<description>ABC/Ipsos poll of likely voters: Harris 51, Trump 47. This is what Joe Trippi has been saying all along. Trump is doing very well at 47, and 51 is right where he said Harris would be. Her ceiling is 53, he says. With a 4 point advantage, she wins the Electoral College, possibly a blowout.</description>
