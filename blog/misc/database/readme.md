# Database folder

I've been getting all the content of my blog going back to 1994 into an SQL database.

I have to do some work on the database in May 2025, and thought it would be a good idea to export all the documents from the database in a format
that they can easily be loaded into another SQL database.

If you import all the records in all the JSON files here, you will have the same database as I have at daytona.scripting.com.

### List of files

davenet.json contains all the davenet pieces I wrote between 1994 and 2004.
