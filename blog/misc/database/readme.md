# Database folder

I've been getting all the content of my blog going back to 1994 into an SQL database.

I have to do some work on the database in May 2025, and thought it would be a good idea to export all the documents from the database in a format
that they can easily be loaded into another SQL database.

If you import all the records in all the JSON files here, you will have the same database as I have at daytona.scripting.com.

### List of files

These files come from the opmlOtherSources folder in the GitHub repo.

1. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/database/davenet.json">davenet.json</a> contains all the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">DaveNet</a> pieces I wrote between 1994 and 2004.

2. <a href="otherSources.json">otherSources.json</a> has all the posts in the files in sub-folders 1997-2010 and 2016-2017 of the opmlOtherSources folder.
