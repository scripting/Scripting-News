So I decided to do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/31/podcastForTimCarmody.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; for him, and invite him to respond not on Threads but on a blog, or in a podcast, and let's talk about how we work together on this.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@mayfield_ross/post/Cy7f1f-uidy&quot;&gt;Ross Mayfield&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The reason Threads doesnâ€™t have an API or the promised Fediverse coupling is organizational inertia for the fear of another Cambridge Analytica.&quot; I think that's very likely true. I was using Facebook's API when they quietly turned it off, and I didn't blame them for it, given the way journalism was treating them. Everyone knew they had an API, and what it could do was openly published, and promoted by the same journalists who were now blaming them. So while FB has few scruples to admire them for, as a company -- in this case I believe Ross's explanation of why they are treading very carefully here.

There's now a web client, the lack of which was holding me back, but now it's there and it's good, well-designed, attractive, all the things that Twitter isn't now that Elon Musk as renamed it X and effectively turned off API access. Mastodon is still a maze of federation, which some users still seem to think is a positive thing, but honestly, Facebook (they call themselves Meta now) has a better product, all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/28/thisIsYourHomeBase.png&quot;&gt;federation michegas&lt;/a&gt; on Masto makes it a mess. Facebook &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; replace Twitter if all the web can muster as an alternative is Masto. Oh but the FB folk say don't worry, we're going to support ActivityPub. The way this works is they can hold off the fear by just saying they'll do something, without explaining how or when it'll work. And they could change their mind, or somehow never get around to shipping. I've been in tech since the 70s, and I've seen this movie a few times. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather&quot;&gt;Godfather&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zBwKbq02ds&quot;&gt;always ends exactly the same way&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="This is prime sports time on TV. Last night I switched back and forth between the first Knicks game with Walt Frazier and Mike Breen and the first game of the World Series between Texas and Arizona, a match-up I didn't think I'd care about but to my surprise, it was really good baseball. Both events were like coming home. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhMDoBFYDmA&quot;&gt;Friday Night Knicks&lt;/a&gt; theme is something I forget every year, and then remember right around this time, remember how &lt;i&gt;comfortable&lt;/i&gt; it is to watch the Knicks, even in years when the team sucks, as long as my friends Clyde and Mike are talking us through the game. Movin and groovin, dishin and swishin, so nice we showed it twice and all the other familiar slogans. But this year the Knicks don't suck. The games will be good. And this year the World Series is exciting. Last night's game was won with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_YcqYwTZ-Y&quot;&gt;walk-off 11th inning home run&lt;/a&gt; by a formerly unknown &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolis_Garc%C3%ADa&quot;&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; who has already set the record for the most postseason RBIs, and the series is just getting started. They play 162 games in a baseball season so each game doesn't mean that much, until the end of the season when every game matters, at this point, every inning matters and sometimes every at-bat. I've never been much of a football fan except for the years when I lived in the Valley and the Niners were rising. Not my sport. But I've loved both baseball and basketball my whole life, there are real family roots here, and traditions old and new. And tonight there's another World Series game and the Knicks are in New Orleans playing the Pelicans. Good times! :smile:" created="Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:33:45 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/28/garcia.png"/>

					<outline text="My answer is this -- if ActivityPub were sufficient, I'd say yes -- let's coalesce around one standard, and stop trying to make something slightly better. I have a motto that goes with this -- One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. For a couple of reasons: 1. You still have to support both, so you just made everyone's life more complicated, assuming the second way gains traction. 2. The goal is interop, not creating standards.

The runtime takes care of suspending your thread when you need to wait for a result, it does not show up in the syntax of the language. The Frontier programming language also has an intimate relationship with its database, whereas in JavaScript and MySQL there are layers of levels between the JS stack and the database.

					<outline text="And since I designed Frontier, this is self-praise, for which I apologize, but let me share with you the secret that makes Frontier so much better. For years in development I factored and refactored every time I came up with a simpler way to do something. I had been programming for a decade when I started Frontier, and had used some great highly factored tools before -- specifically Unix and THINK C, and I understood the process, having done it with commercial Mac, IBM and Apple II end-user products. I treated every aspect of development as you would treat the user experience of end-user software. And since you are an intimately involved user, there's a huge advantage here. I just had the time, and took the time to do the factoring that so far no one else has taken. At least to my knowledge and that's a big caveat because we don't generally use each others' platforms in tech, unlike other arts and sciences, we tend to live in and create our own caves.

Over time the machine you're building on becomes more complex, the interconnections between the components become harder to grok, and you often don't remember why you did this or that. You resist making changes that could bring the whole thing down. So evolution of software becomes slower. There is a reason you can't keep pitching in baseball, or being a basketball star after 40.

I'd also go for Blogtree, which was an innovative and fascinating effort to create basically a family tree of early blogs. I'd approach it like an archeologist. Some of the originals aren't with us any longer, some that never got the notoriety that they deserved imho, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle&quot;&gt;Jerry Pournelle&lt;/a&gt;, who greatly influenced me as an observer of tech.

Doc Searls, the Cluetrain, Kottke, Meghead, I know there are whole universes of blogging that I don't know anything about, it grew so large so quickly. And it was very gratifying to see the Harvard blogs mostly restored. There was a lot of stuff that didn't make the first cut.

					<outline text="Today's debate is whether Elon Musk is out to strangle journalism by algorithmically downplaying links somehow. But that isn't what he said. What he actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; is that in Twitter people don't click on links. This is observable. I've known this for years as I tried to arrange it so people could read my blog posts where ever they wanted, and finally in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;gave up&lt;/a&gt; because it was impossible. Even if Twitter had completely dropped the character limit then, it still wouldn't have been possible." created="Wed, 04 Oct 2023 16:44:45 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/10/04/debbieDowner.png"/>

Interesting place, new construction but designed to feel like an old time gas station and garage.

				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Google kicked RSS's ass&lt;/b&gt;. I'm wondering if when that happened, I shouldn't have stepped up and tried to raise a great &quot;RSS&quot; reader from OpenSourceLand. But I don't think it could have happened. It's funny how people processed that event, I didn't see any anger at Google, which if my little old &quot;UserLand&quot; had done something like that, there would have been a huge shitstorm. I think they manage their PR well because there's no one identifiable as the personality of Google, neither of the founders are visible. They don't tweet, you never hear anything about them outside of the business press. Same with the two people they've hired as CEO. Anyway, they treated RSS like an unwanted litter of kittens, put in a shopping bag and dropped from a bridge over a river. No thought to cleaning up the mess they created. They treated their users and the standard they took over like crap. But people need a &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; to be angry with. I'm much less consequential from a business standpoint, or user-control for that matter, my products get ignored mostly, but I am outspoken. And this makes me easy to be angry with. Anyway, I didn't step up because 1. I didn't think anything would come of it and 2. I didn't want to get embroiled in all the anger again. The last time it had nearly killed me.
