					<outline text="The big change under the covers is that it hooks into &quot;FeedLand&quot; on its own. When you're reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers&quot;&gt;Bloggers tab&lt;/a&gt;, you're reading content that came directly from the new Automattic-hosted FeedLand server.

We're going to work with other sources, using reading lists, to create a news flow from blogs that we think are interesting, along with what other people think are interesting. How this will develop is not yet clear, but we are going to work on this. When I say &quot;we,&quot; I mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://cagrimmett.com/&quot;&gt;Chuck Grimmett&lt;/a&gt; and myself and others at Automattic.

					<outline text="We're putting a lot of development behind this. FeedLand has been in development for almost three freaking years. This last year has been spent turning corners, and building out features so they can scale to Automattic-level flow. And adding one major new kickass feature to the world of feeds -- reading lists. The ability to subscribe to lists of feeds. We're going to use that in a lot of places. I wanted to get that in the product before we started using it. And it's in, and it works. There are still a few glitches to work out, you know -- software can always work better than it does. :smile:" created="Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:23:48 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I've heard ActivityPub described as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twoWayRss&quot;&gt;two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt;. If so, there are imho more direct ways to arrive at that. I think it's possible to create a federation system that takes a few days to implement. Maybe it doesn't need all the features they've put into ActivityPub. I'm pretty sure a lightweight social network is what's called for now. I know 20 different ventures have started up to do this, but isn't it weird that none of them have built on RSS. That's the only approach imho that has a chance of doing something unique here. I'd rather work with other people, but I'm not into replacing simplicity with something that's not very simple." created="Wed, 29 Nov 2023 13:57:20 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/04/melo.png"/>

I wish at times my mind worked more like a computer. When their bot says &quot;there were only three possible solutions at that point&quot; -- I wish I could see what they are at each point, or at least know how many they are, if not what they are. The training has also helped my mind debug software. I'm not as daunted as I often am when there appears to be no solution to the problem I'm working on. I'm sure I'll find it eventually.

				<outline text="People who say Twitter is over aren't considering how vast it is. Same kind of situation as with Atom many years ago. It wasn't obvious how deeply installed RSS was, all the networks that had been created with it. It was basically impossible at that time to displace RSS. Anyway, same thing with Twitter today, no matter how vile &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-tweets-pizzagate-conspiracy-pedo-epstein-1851053448&quot;&gt;the owner&lt;/a&gt; of the network is. It has been around since 2006, a time of huge growth in networking, and it captured basically all of it. So if there's anyone you need to reach, and they're hooked up to the net, you almost certainly will be able to reach them on Twitter. This is another situation like Napster. Never have you had all the music of our civilization available so easily to so many people. We could have done so much with that. The most prudent thing to do with Twitter is to organize a buyout for Musk, and get him out of that position. We don't need to delete it, not that we could, we need to get Musk out of a position of control. " created="Wed, 29 Nov 2023 13:48:08 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oppenheimer/&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer&lt;/a&gt; last night. Very good movie. I like the artistic flourishes, reminds me of another movie I watched recently and liked, a lot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spencer/&quot;&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't really interested in the life and death of Lady Di, but I also got through the latest episodes of The Crown, which I had resisted when the newest Queen was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_5)&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt;. I find it hard to make the adjustment to new actors playing the roles of characters I had come to love, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Foy&quot;&gt;Claire Foy&lt;/a&gt; as young Queen Elizabeth, a fantastic actress who played in one of the most spectacular dramatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/a&gt; anywhere anytime. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_6)&quot;&gt;latest episodes&lt;/a&gt; of The Crown were about Diana mostly, and were fantastic. Back to Oppenheimer. I'll try not to spoil it too much, but the drama is puzzling, why are they going after Oppenheimer when he miraculously put together the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project&quot;&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/a&gt; which created, in a race with Germany and the USSR, the bomb that ended World War II. The final scene, a flashback to an earlier scene where we didn't hear the dialog, between Oppenheimer and his colleague at Princeton, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, about what happens when you create something that changes the direction of humanity. What happens is this -- they push you aside. I'm not comparing myself to these two giants, but I have had the same question about how tech reacted to my contributions. My conclusion was that our culture has reason to erase the accomplishments of outliers. We prefer innovation to come in nice predictable packages, with a PR person on top, and when that's disturbed, we close ranks to make it all appear very ordinary. Anyway, all of this is very good holiday entertainment and thought provoking. My next adventure in video is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/pachinko/&quot;&gt;Pachinko&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV, which is somewhat confusing, but keeps me coming back, it's so compelling. I still have the last seasons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/ted-lasso/&quot;&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/reservation-dogs/&quot;&gt;Reservation Dogs&lt;/a&gt; in the queue. And of course there's a new season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(season_5)&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, which I'm sure I'll love. Right now my plan is to wait for the series to end and watch it all in a binge.

It does the job I wanted it to do, presents in one user interface the content of my blog, linkblog, and several timelines from FeedLand. The previous version had the tab links &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/11/24/190107.html&quot;&gt;down the left edge&lt;/a&gt;. I loved the way it looked on my desktop system, but then I tried it on my iPad, and realized it didn't work. Not enough horizonal real estate to pull it off. So I went back to the tabs-across-the-top format. I had to drop one of the tabs, and not use the nice Font-Awesome icons I used previously on Scripting News when there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/currentScriptingHome.png&quot;&gt;plenty of room&lt;/a&gt;.

I wasn't in the mood. But eventually I tried it, and I liked it very much. The mood is civil and often artistic. There are some very creative people there. And I think the API, while it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/892d671e-1dc9-4ffc-9101-cadbca842adc&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt; to me, is understandable to developers who put their minds to it, and I expect Colin is one who will figure it out. And I don't think there's any hope of ActivityPub, it's far too underspecified, and interop is likely to be product-based, not based on the protocol, where the Bluesky protocol appears to be overly-well-thought-out, or maybe the docs could have more examples.

In her closing she said that OpenAI has a market evaluation of $50 billion, yet they only gave $5 million to journalism. This is a big loop. The same was said about Apple and IBM with their personal computers in the 80s. They make so much money they should give it to us. Then Google, Twitter and Facebook in the 00s and 10s. And now in the 20s the same tired appeal, a highly conflicted one (you don't hear similar cases made for other industries that are disrupted by tech). Now they've got the tin cup out for AI. Journalism could have owned Twitter, but they would have had to work with each other. Insiders in journalism chuckle at the idea, but it isn't funny. They keep letting tech own their means of distribution. In this case, it isn't too late. Start an AI news service, combine the flow of all competitors, and distribute the money the way you wish OpenAI would. That's honorable, and it might work. Basically, all information, including journalism is making another leap, with or without journalism.

There's are all kinds of tricks, I know because I succeeded in that world. When I ask ChatGPT to tell me about things that journalism got wrong that I know everything about, it gets it right. I don't know how that works, because what I think are their sources got it wrong. It's freaking amazing.

					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Note: This story was written entirely by ChatGPT.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:24:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the digital realm of FeedLand, a world pulsating with streams of information, there existed a unique society where knowledge and news were the sources of power. This world was composed of various domains, each representing different genres of information – from the News Mountains to the Blog Plains, the Podcast Peninsula, and beyond." created="Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:23:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The protagonist of our story is a young, curious girl named Ada. In FeedLand, each individual had a personal Feed – a dynamic stream of information tailored to their interests and needs. Ada, however, was different. She had the rare ability to see and interact with all the Feeds in FeedLand, a talent that was both a gift and a burden."/>
					<outline text="Ada's journey began when she noticed disturbances in the Feeds – information was getting muddled, important news was lost in a sea of trivial updates, and misinformation was spreading like wildfire. This chaos was causing confusion and conflict among the inhabitants of FeedLand."/>
					<outline text="Determined to restore balance, Ada embarked on a quest to find the Core Source, the mythical origin of all Feeds in FeedLand. She believed that by reaching the Core Source, she could rectify the disturbances and bring order back to the information flow."/>
					<outline text="Ada's adventure took her through diverse territories. In the News Mountains, she navigated through towering peaks of breaking stories and deep valleys of in-depth analyses. In the Blog Plains, she encountered a wide array of opinions and narratives, learning to discern the insightful from the mundane. The Podcast Peninsula challenged her with a cacophony of voices and perspectives, each vying for attention."/>
					<outline text="Along her journey, Ada was accompanied by a group of companions, each representing different aspects of FeedLand's information ecosystem. There was Lex, a fact-checker with the uncanny ability to spot inaccuracies in seconds; Echo, a podcaster who could weave stories that captivated anyone who listened; and Pixel, a visual artist who could bring any information to life through graphics and animations."/>
					<outline text="Together, they faced challenges like the Trolls of Misinformation, the Echo Chambers where no new thoughts could penetrate, and the Filter Bubbles that isolated communities from one another."/>
					<outline text="Finally, they reached the Core Source, a vast, glowing nexus of data and information. Ada realized that the Core Source had become overwhelmed with the sheer volume and variety of information being generated. She used her unique ability to untangle the flows, filter out the noise, and establish new, more efficient pathways for information dissemination."/>
					<outline text="As a result, the Feeds of FeedLand became clearer, more accurate, and more accessible to its inhabitants. Knowledge and news flowed harmoniously, enriching the lives of all who lived there."/>
					<outline text="Ada's journey taught her the importance of critical thinking, discernment, and the responsible sharing of information. She continued to explore the ever-evolving landscape of FeedLand, always ensuring that the streams of information remained pure and beneficial."/>
					<outline text="Her story became a legend in FeedLand, inspiring others to be mindful of the information they consumed and shared, making Ada a symbol of wisdom and guidance in the digital age." created="Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:23:58 GMT"/>

And they have relationships with each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and relationships.

That's what makes this podcast so interesting, it tells me about myself before I developed my fine-tuned skepticism, as we review the music of my Boomer life. I tended to believe the stories I was told. When I was a kid I loved to read biographies, but as time went by I knew some of the people who had bios written about them, in fact short bios were written about me in magazines.

					<outline text="I tried an experiment a few days ago. I got a random question that made no sense, about RSS and local files and seemed to depend on magic. I get these all the time and I don't have the intellectual ability or patience to understand what they're saying. So I pasted the email verbatim &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/5eaed401-dec7-44cd-a2a4-9725c4d99e65&quot;&gt;into ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and it answered the question. I sent the person a link to the answer, and he responded, cryptically as before, but apparently ChatGPT understood what he was asking for, where I did not. Now we're getting a glympse at the future.

I saw &lt;i&gt;Web 3&lt;/i&gt; as a cheap exploitation of something open and wonderful, the Web, purely for greed. Like Exxon laying waste to the Arctic for more oil profits.

					<outline text="AI is more challenging, not as clear-cut, and at the same time incredibly useful even seductive, and we need minds like Hickey's to look at this carefully and think, and use it as a tool, so he can help us understand what's going on.

				<outline text="Yesterday a user asked why &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/226&quot;&gt;WordPress signon&lt;/a&gt; and not Google, Facebook or Apple. I know there are services that take care of all the logins. But I don't know who they are, the people, investors, and what they do with the data that flows through their systems. But there's another reason, I've known &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; since it was founded, I knew &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; when he arrived in San Francisco in the early 00s, and have worked on a few projects with him and people at the company, and I respect him and the company he's built. I've written a lot about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/20/couldS3BeAnEnduserProduct.html&quot;&gt;kind&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131043&quot;&gt;identity systems&lt;/a&gt; we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/06/141135.html&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; to foster development. Right now the economics are such that in order to ship a simple product you have to raise VC money. But technologically, if users could buy storage, instead having individual developers buy it and resell it to them, we could get back to a time when an individual could make a hit product. You don't know how important that is. Products made by companies never take the creative risks that individuals can. That's why innovation in social media was stuck for 17 years with Twitter's idea of a post. Anyway -- I know that Google, Facebook and Apple would never listen to me, but Automattic does. So I'm willing to meet them in the middle. Okay let's see what we can do with this login thing. It's in &quot;FeedLand&quot; now. :smile:" created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:49:45 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/04/feedlandLogoPossible.png"/>

					<outline text="Last Tuesday I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/10/31.html#a214551&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; specifically for Tim Carmody. But you can listen to, and I hope you do.  " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 14:57:35 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I do this from time to time, when I want to work with someone, I often will speak directly to them in public. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+working+together&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; is the only way to bootstrap open systems. I did it because I saw Tim, who I know as a smart tech writer, a creative person and thinker, as someone who could appreciate how little it takes to start a bootstrap. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:06:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It worked. Yesterday he wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/23/11/the-future-of-rss-is-textcasting-1&quot;&gt;piece on kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; that got a lot of coverage. It got a lot of people thinking about &quot;textcasting&quot; and &quot;RSS&quot;. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:08:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The coolest thing he said are the first four words in the headline. &lt;i&gt;The Future of RSS&lt;/i&gt; -- you know I've never seen anyone write those four words because RSS got so thoroughly maligned by the bigco's of tech, they really did a number on RSS, probably because it was so freaking good and so freaking simple. Who needs big tech companies to make it usable for you if it's basically usable all on its own. :boom:" created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:35:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Tim made the point I couldn't make on my own. People must think I have a conflict with RSS, but I've never made any money from RSS, I advocate on its behalf because I think it's the right thing to do. And I wanted to show Tim that if he did it, people would listen. And they did! Oh my. I heard about it from so many people. Did you see this piece on Kottke!? I was told/asked yesterday over and over. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:09:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And maybe people are now beginning to see that RSS would make the perfect connective protocol in addition to the more complex ActivityPub for the next generation of social networks. He also got me excited, now knowing that I am not the only person trying to push this boulder up a hill. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:10:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Feeds are still there to help tie everything together. RSS only exists because people want it to exist. The more you want it to exist, the more it will. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:10:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So Tim, let's keep beating the drum. The goal as far as I'm concerned is to craft the perfect environment for writers on the web. We still have not tried to do that, because the BigCo's have convinced us that we need to be locked-in to get anything out of the tech. Well I'm here to tell you that's not true. And in the coming weeks and months I hope to prove it to you. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:10:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's time to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; stuff. Let's all work together on this. You'd be amazed how few people it takes to get something like &quot;textcasting&quot; going. " created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:11:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PS: I don't agree with everything Tim said in his list of four needs. I don't need metrics or moderation. Believe me, I know about abuse, I knew about it before all of you did, because in the beginning I was the target of most of the abuse in the blogosphere. I learned some fundamental things about abuse, don't offer people a way to abuse you and you won't be abused. It means don't think of this as a conversational medium, and don't count on everyone hearing you. Use it for thinking out loud, and be happy when people hear you, but don't expect it." created="Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:13:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PPS: At the end Tim asks what his role is. He's a writer and damned good one and one who thinks about how his writing gets to readers. I haven't found many writers who are thinking about that, but imho they &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; should be, esp right now when the dominance of tech companies is so iffy, when the possibilities are so open. I write software for writers, so I exist to make Tim happy. I want to be sure he can use the writing tools he loves (btw, maybe more than one, for different kinds of writing).
