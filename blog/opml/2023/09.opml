				<outline text="Maybe chatbots will enable people to flame forever to a robot who will argue with them forever and not care. Or maybe we're already there. I found myself ranting at ChatGPT earlier today about Google. I could not get it to agree with me. It had drunk the Silicon Valley Kool Aid and I said so! Eventually it sort of came around to my way of viewing things, but it quickly snapped back to the party line. I wonder if psychologists have studied this to see what happen if people: 1. Have an interminable argument without ever convincing the other person (or robot) of their rightness or 2. Have a longish argument and eventually prevail. Is there a sense of closure when the OP says you know you're right, I've changed my mind! Can they now go on with their lives feeling like a winner instead of always losing to the corrupt and all-powerful woke coastal elites or the corrupt magas of middle America?

After he gets on the train, he notices that one of the gloves has fallen onto the platform. It's too late to get off the train to retrieve the glove, so he opens the window and throws the other glove onto the platform next to the first one. A generous gesture that costs him nothing. The perp ignores the advice. The thing is, who in our world will do the generous thing that costs them nothing? It's so rare. And if few us will, what exactly is the point of saving our civilization? What values do we have that are worth preserving? We think we're good people, but really we aren't unless we help each other.

				<outline text="As I get older things that used to seem like mysteries now seem simple. How many times has someone said they love you when you think hmm I don't think that's really love. How long did it take you to figure it out? At this point I know what love is. If you can be yourself with another person then you can be sure that's love. If you can snuggle up with them and relax, either physically or figuratively, and again, just be yourself, that's love, for sure. But if you have to be a certain way, pretend to be someone you're not, to stay in good stead with the other person, then that isn't love. It's just that simple. If you find yourself blurting out &quot;I love you&quot; without any thought, maybe even surprised yourself, that's love. But love is not a status, not a state of being. It's an act. You could be &quot;in love&quot; one moment and the next, not. That doesn't mean in the next moment after that you won't share love again. It's just that feelings are always in motion. Love is a feeling of freedom to be yourself, or in another way -- to just be. Love is the essence of being you. Nothing elusive about it. You are made of it. " created="Sat, 30 Sep 2023 12:40:11 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="But we have really bad examples of love relationships in TV and movies and in our families. I hear people say things that I imagine they got from watching a show, where the writers, for dramatic purposes I guess, have the characters say things in the name of love that have nothing to do with it, or often are the opposite, people trying to be something they obviously aren't. I don't think my parents or grandparents shared much love with each other, maybe they had their moments, but they weren't often. My uncle once told me, after my aunt died and he was looking for a new wife to take her place, it was like casting for a movie, that it's betrayal if a person turns out to not be what they appeared to be on the first date. A lot of people think that way. To figure out love, you have to take a step back from culture and families and just be yourself and see who likes you. You just found love. ❤️" created="Sat, 30 Sep 2023 13:14:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

It would work. Probably one of the most revolutionary things they could do, and it's so easy. That they all come from DC or New York is probably why most of the rest of the country feels they are so clueless and elite. I laugh when Chris Hayes talks about what he thinks, or what he has experienced. I laugh because I think he's an idiot, and has no relevant experience. How about getting a child of Holocaust survivors to do the news, now that we're on the brink of a Nazi revolution in America. Might help sober people up a bit. Have a segment every night that explains how Hitler did what Trump is doing, and what it led to. This cozy little setup needs to be exploded. Start by getting off the East Coast, and out into the country. It would do wonders for perspective. BTW, President Biden picketing with striking Michigan auto-workers is an excellent example of this approach. He could have given a speech in the Rose Garden but that would have had no impact, wouldn't do anything to shift anyone's perspective." created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:47:13 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png"/>

Thanks to all the people who helped answer the question, readers of this blog, friends from the Drummer and FeedLand communities, even devs who work at Automattic. :smile:" created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:16:06 GMT"/>

					<outline text="This is &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; one of those times. ;-)" created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:22:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="WordPress has the ability to add the equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/8a9f7f36-b1b6-482f-94e7-8aa9b30dc134&quot;&gt;Mac refcons&lt;/a&gt; to WordPress posts.

Once it's created you can access and update the stored object via their API. " created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:22:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I haven't tried it myself, because I don't have my own WordPress installation and I assume I can't install software on wordpress.com.

					<outline text="I want to create an editor for WordPress posts that's perfect for me. That means I edit the post in my outliner. I can attach attributes to headlines, like an image attribute with a small graphic that's displayed in the right margin. Or I can enclose text in double-square brackets and have it be indexed by and linked to my tag manager, like this: [[Drummer]]. Or I can use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/24/150234.html?title=theGlossaryInLittleOutliner&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; to fill in links and data that I want standardize on. I've developed a set of tools I've been using in some cases for over 30 years. I want to use them in WordPress. But more importantly, I want WordPress to become a writing platform for everyone, I think it can do a lot of important things that it doesn't do, and it's being held back by this missing feature. That's how I look at it, and I realize that's a different perspective from that of developers who work inside Automattic who have to keep their servers running." created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:24:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And btw, I can do much of that without this feature. But with it, I can edit any post even if I don't have the application I wrote it with handy, or the source code for the post I want to change. This is part of the philosophy of having only one structure for my blog writing, to make it easy to make changes. If I have two structures, one for editing and one for reading all of a sudden making a change takes a dozen or more steps, where if the data lives in the same place as the rendered content, it can be edited with one click. This breakthrough, and it was definitely a breakthrough in the development of blogging, in 1999, was in a post entitled Edit This Page. " created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:33:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway I assume the current design makes sure only people who have access to the server can do this. Or maybe it's just an oversight? I hope it's the latter, and I hope we can have the feature in the API in time to make a difference. " created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:29:50 GMT"/>

					<outline text="BTW, this idea goes back to the early Macintosh OS. Every object in the system had a 32-bit refcon which could be anything the app wanted it to be. Usually it was a pointer to an object that contained a lot of data and more pointers. You could attach them to a window, a menu, a button in a dialog, IIRC every object had a refcon. Whole complex systems were built around this idea. It meant that the platform vendor (Apple) could evolve their internal structures without breaking developers. You can develop whole app ecosystems around this simple idea. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2023 12:41:46 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I saw a thread somewhere about why &quot;OPML&quot; was used as the export format for feed readers. Not sure I've ever written about this. At the time we were finishing up &quot;Radio UserLand&quot;, in either 2001 or 2002 (there were two big releases). I wanted a way to export the user's feed list so people could use the same list in another reader. This one decision is why there are so many feed readers imho. Because we offered no lock-in as a key feature, everyone else including Google had to do it with their products. Users had the expectation of data portability, so it's in the DNA of feed readers. Maybe we would have dominated the market with Radio if we didn't export the feed list, it was for a while the only feed reader, but more likely Google would have entered and clobbered us, users wouldn't have been able to use both products, or easily move on after Reader shut down. Anyway, why OPML? First, we had it around, it was new, I wanted people to use it, and I also wanted to use the outliner to edit my subscription lists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#History&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; didn't exist as an option at the time. And using &quot;RSS&quot; for that seemed confusing and not right. RSS is a syndication format, representing a &lt;i&gt;flow&lt;/i&gt; of information, where OPML represents a list that evolves, but each item has permanence. It's static where RSS is dynamic. It's like the difference between a podcast and an album of music. You listen to a podcast once and it's gone,  you may listen to an album many times over decades. Fundamentally different kinds of data, with different needs in how they evolve, and thus the format you use to represent it. Yes we could have shoehorned feed lists into RSS, but 20 years later I'm glad we didn't.

Really pretty much all the time. And it's disheartening and not at all flattering to hear someone thank you for giving them that idea. This is the saddest thing in my life and it keeps happening. An example, I once went to visit Adam Curry in Amsterdam and he showed me an office full of people he hired to do what I had already done. Adam did that over and over. The problem is you can't hire someone to be Doc or me. No matter how many rooms you fill with attractive people. When you try to do our ideas, we've learned, people seem to always miss the heart of it.

				<outline text="Something happened on the drive to Boston last week that makes we wary of trusting the FSD feature of my Tesla model Y. I was on the NY State Thruway going north, a few miles south of the exit for I-90E to Boston, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot&quot;&gt;FSD mode&lt;/a&gt;, in the right lane, when I see a hundred yards or so ahead a car with flashing lights in the shoulder. Before waiting to see what FSD would do, I signaled a left turn, which is a clever feature that tells the FSD software to switch lanes. It started to do so, then the software must've noticed the car with the flashing lights and inbetween the two lanes it hit the brakes hard, and slowed us down to a dangerous speed, esp if there had been a car behind us. But there was absolutely no danger. The car in the shoulder wasn't even close enough to make a difference if we had remained in the right lane, but we were leaving it. And it tried to stop us in no man's land. Insane. Anyone seeing this behavior would have thought I was drunk. So next time something like that happens if I'm in FSD mode, I'm going to cancel it by turning the steering wheel slightly and taking over fully. I have trouble believing people who let this thing drive without overriding it regularly." created="Sun, 10 Sep 2023 19:12:04 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/08/teslaModelY.png"/>

				<outline text="A couple of weeks ago I found and fixed an error in &quot;PagePark&quot; that made &quot;FeedLand&quot; and &quot;Drummer&quot; fail. The apps were offline until I could restart the server, and that sometimes meant hours of downtime.  That no longer happens. But now there's a different problem, sometimes I go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?river=true&amp;screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my news page&lt;/a&gt; on feedland.org and for a minute or so there's no response. Eventually I give up and try again in a new tab. Same thing. Eventually the problem clears and the server returns to it's normal performance. I'm starting to think about how I might isolate this problem. My theory is that the problem is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;appserver&lt;/a&gt; layer, not in FeedLand itself, because when it happens nothing is returned. If it were at a higher level, the lockup would be in the code that gets a timeline or feedlist or whatever, so you would see a menu at the top of the screen. But it's always the news page this happens on, come to think of it. Maybe I should start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/270&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on this in case other FeedLand users who are also developers (please) might have some ideas." created="Sun, 03 Sep 2023 13:18:17 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/06/17/charlieTheTuna.png"/>

					<outline text="In the 1973 comedic sci-fi film “Sleeper”, Shanker is humorously alluded to as the man responsible for the apocalypse. When Allen’s character, Miles Monroe, is brought up to speed after being cryogenically frozen for 200 years, he learns that civilization fell when “Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead.” This jest exaggerated Shanker’s reputation as a contentious union leader."/>
					<outline text="Later, in the 1977 romantic comedy “Annie Hall”, Shanker’s name emerges again when Allen’s character shares a humorous quip about two magazines merging to form “Dysentery”, recounting that he told the joke to Shanker."/>
					<outline text="Both references underscore Shanker’s significant presence in the socio-political landscape of the 1970s, immortalizing him in cinematic satire."/>
