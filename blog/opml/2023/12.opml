				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Andrew Hickey&lt;/a&gt; is this year's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Blogger+of+the+Year&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. He's a prototypical blogger, exactly the kind of person I hoped would &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/13/165056.html?title=sourcesGoDirectExplained&quot;&gt;create&lt;/a&gt; their own media having profound positive impact on people's lives. People like me. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/&quot;&gt;500 Songs&lt;/a&gt; podcast, which I've written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+500+songs&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt;, focuses on a song in every episode and tells you how the pieces came together to create it. When a new episode comes out I greedily savor it, like a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bagel&quot;&gt;bagel&lt;/a&gt; from Zabar's or a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino#Filmography&quot;&gt;Tarantino&lt;/a&gt; movie. Two recent episodes, one about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-165-dark-star-by-the-grateful-dead/&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead&lt;/a&gt; and the other about &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-171-hey-jude-by-the-beatles/&quot;&gt;Hey Jude&lt;/a&gt;, changed my views of each of the groups, in the first case confirming an intuition, and in the other showing me how naive my idea of how a song comes together. I am envious of how the musicians work together, it may be a cuthroat industry, but it seems incredibly collaborative compared to how tech works, where we all pretty much ignore each other. Hickey isn't just a podcaster, he's also a blogger, and he does it in an unusual place, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social&quot;&gt;on Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. He has things to say and that's of course what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB's&lt;/a&gt; are all about. You may not care for their opinions, but you will know what they are. Anyway, if you like the Beatles, I highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-171-hey-jude-by-the-beatles/&quot;&gt;latest episode&lt;/a&gt;, and if you like popular music, &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/feed/podcast/&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2F500songs.com%2Ffeed%2Fpodcast%2F&quot;&gt;500 Songs&lt;/a&gt;. And if you know of any podcasts like this, please let me know. I always want to add to my podcast reading list.

				<outline text="A quiet end for 2023. It was not a fantastic year, work-wise. I spent almost all my time working away from my interests. First project was completely replacing the identity system in the two apps I'm maintaining -- &quot;Drummer&quot; and &quot;FeedLand&quot;, and letting the others end. No one ever says thanks for this kind of work, but it's as basic as converting a house from oil heat to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump&quot;&gt;heat pump&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the ducts still work, but things break in hard to find ways. I also converted FeedLand from a simple app that runs on a virtual server, to a scalable and durable app (we hope) that runs in a big cloud. This part was good, but again the work is far from where my expertise and interests lie. So at the beginning of a new year, I'm going to remind myself that I'm too old and not paid well enough (I'm not paid at all, heh) to do another year of this kind of work. I should be making writing and reading tools work better on the web. That's my mission. If it isn't related to that, please understand when I don't give it a high priority. Just one person here. Surprisingly resilient, but also quite tired. " created="Sun, 31 Dec 2023 18:12:41 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png"/>

				<outline text="When I say &quot;textcasting&quot; is &quot;applying the philosophy of podcasting to text&quot; -- what I mean in practical terms is that my flow of ideas is available &quot;where ever you get your text.&quot; Choice in subscribing has to be that fluid, commonsense, and choice is something people feel entitled to, as they do with podcasts. I've been told people would never understand the philosophy of podcasting, but they do, they understand they're entitled to choice in how to listen and thus producers are free to choose where to publish. Somehow text, which is so much easier to transmit than audio, is far less flexible. That's a mistake I want to undo, but I can't do it alone. I need to work with other people who have writing and reading tools, and people who have something to say and want all the features of writing to be at their disposal, and for it to be easy, inexpensive but not free of charge, and not owned by the titans of tech. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7dBMYUyRAQ&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind. &quot;You can get it if you really want.&quot;" created="Sat, 30 Dec 2023 16:26:40 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Yesterday I wrote that &lt;i&gt;working together&lt;/i&gt; is the challenge for open tech developers. If you're waiting for a big company to work with you, and we all are, the answer is you'll probably wait a long time, and you probably won't get there. It's not impossible, but it is improbable. So while you're waiting, why not work with a peer on solving a problem you both have in somewhat different ways, but make what you do compatible. That's what working together is about. It's not just that the people did it, but you created something that lives on that works together. There's even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH3ruuml-R4&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; that goes with this. &quot;If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with.&quot;   " created="Sat, 30 Dec 2023 16:04:14 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="There's been a bit of trouble on my servers the last couple of days, and as a result a couple of domains are not working for everyone, or are behaving in mysterious ways. I moved &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting.org&lt;/a&gt; to a server that has a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/25&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; installed, and therefore supports HTTPS. I am able to see the domain on my local machines, but not on my phone, and I'm getting reports that other people are getting empty pages. And theoretically there should be no way that people should get a non-HTTPS version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm seeing hits for the HTTP version in my log.

And we've gotten out of the habit of trying out new ideas with our networks. And we're building systems that depend on the kindness of our peers and big companies, and keep learning that this is not a kind world. All this is why we've been spinning our wheels for 17 years, and unless we start working together, for real, we'll just keep spinning.

				<outline text="The state of networked writing at the end of 2023 -- broken, in many cases, no doubt, deliberately, to keep networks from interoperating. One system allows multiple tags per item, another limits it to one. One has a limit of 280 chars, another 500, but if you pay 10,000. There is no interop, we all write in silos. The basic feature of the web, linking, is especially broken. These are all incredibly simple features requiring practically no resources., This must be deliberate, because the problem is so easily solved. Most people can't see the potential of the open internet as a fantastic writing environment, but it can be one, but only if we want it.

We're failing at a number of big challenges (climate, guns, abortion, democracy, racial hate, wars), with everyone's future at stake. They could grant ChatGPT a license until at least they had their own product up. That would send the right message, our journalism is an aid to our survival, and we wanted to be sure you had access to the paper of record, now and in the future. Instead they want to take their data out of the mix, and who knows if they ever plan to get it back in.

				<outline text="So much of the history isn't covered on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page on RSS&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the apps that got the ball rolling in the spring of 1999: my.netscape and my.userland and the four pioneering web pubs: Salon, Wired, Motley Fool and Red Herring. We immediately put new feed support into Manila and the early versions of Radio and were followed by Blogger, Movable Type and basically the whole blogging world (WordPress was still a few years in the future). It was all that adoption in a short period of time that made RSS a big thing. Professional and amateur writers in one space. When you went to see what's new, the web did the surfing for you. For me it was the continuation of a story that goes back to the San Francisco &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/07/davesautomatedwebster.html&quot;&gt;newspaper strike&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. And it's still happening today on Twitter, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon. It's a continuing story. Not over by a lot.

Very often when I got to the store and plugged the machine in, it would start right up. That became a superstition, if your computer won't launch take it for a ride in the car. Anyway, this morning, in 2023, my web app, the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; that I'm working on was in a state that was really depressing. I was working on making it mobile-friendly and nothing I did would make the timeline fit into the alotted space. I was at my wits end, thinking maybe I'd have to revert my changes and try another approach. So I went out for a walk, it's a nice day, kind of warm, and the air is clear, no rain, and there are even some trees in bloom which is weird considering that it's &lt;i&gt;the day after Christmas&lt;/i&gt; for crying out loud. But it was a good thing to do, when I got back I had a plan for how to go forward. My brain was now clear. I got myself a nice bowl of fruit salad and a glass of water, and sat down and rolled up my sleeves, and I bet by now dear reader you've figured out the punchline. It worked. I did nothing. Every bit showed up in the right place, more or less (modulo some tweaking). Back with Apple II in the 80s it wasn't really magic. The chips weren't soldered into the motherboard on the machine, and they would get pretty hot, and when you'd turn the computer off and on, it would go hot and cold, which meant the pins on the chips would expand and contract and in doing so, over months, one could unseat. A trip in the car might just jog it back into its socket. The same way, forty years later, if you get up from the computer and go for a walk, when you come back, cached requests have now aged-out and the files that weren't getting refreshed are now up to date, and it turns out I wasn't crazy or incompetent, and it probably wasn't some kind of act of god, it's just the internet being the internet." created="Tue, 26 Dec 2023 17:47:45 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/26/appleII.png"/>

Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York).

					<outline text="I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin&quot;&gt;Tony Levin&lt;/a&gt;, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  " created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:29:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin&quot;&gt;Pete Levin&lt;/a&gt; on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? " created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:09:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking." created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:21:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To me, music is as software probably is to most people who use it. I love it, but I don't have much of an idea of how it's made.

That's how we're doing it in &quot;FeedLand&quot;. And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for Brent's account on Bluesky, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;.

But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online.

I started watching the new one, and all of a sudden the two princes, William and Harry, are actual people. I have a lot of trouble with that, because of course I remember when they were born. However I'm pretty sure I'll go all the way through. There are a lot of hours of entertainment in The Crown and a few scenes that are truly spectacular (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;). I remember the really good ones of course, but there's an awful lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schlock&quot;&gt;schlock&lt;/a&gt;. One scene I had not remembered was a pretty good illustration of how fucked up people can be. Princess Diana had just gone on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqe-SuyAyWI&quot;&gt;tour of NYC&lt;/a&gt;, her first international tour on her own, and it was (surprising to her) a huge success. Another British invasion. The people of NYC loved Diana (at least in the show, I don't remember this, I was living in California at the time). So she comes home, and the royal family, instead of cheering her, were angry with her for being so charming. Go figure. Her husband, Prince Charles is yelling at her and he asks her if she ever considered how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla&quot;&gt;Camilla&lt;/a&gt;, Charles' one true love, would feel about Diana being so popular. Diana is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gobsmacked&quot;&gt;gobsmacked&lt;/a&gt; (as am I). Why would she think of that. How totally fucked up is that. Why should anyone, being themselves, being happy, worry about how anyone else might feel about their happiness? I've been in Diana's position a few times, achieving success, much deserved, and was reminded that this upset people who (apparently) didn't want me to succeed? I have even been asked that question. If you ever feel that way, that someone else's happiness is meant to make you feel bad, remember Carl Sagan's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; video.

I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love my writing. Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We weren't very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440&quot;&gt;hear from them&lt;/a&gt;, and that's especially lovely." created="Thu, 14 Dec 2023 21:58:03 GMT" type="outline"/>

Federation isn't itself a benefit. It's an idea hatched by techies who aren't thinking about how people actually use these systems and which features are valued and which are problematic. Imho, what's valued is the ability to publish something quickly, and without much fuss, and follow others, again easily without having to have a deep understanding of how these things are architected. No one but us programming plumbers cares. I think the idea of &lt;i&gt;conversation&lt;/i&gt; not only is overrated, but it's where all the problems are, where all the abuse happens. If we focus on the benefits, quick dissemination of news, and the power of the individual to choose their sources and share them with others -- that's where the juice is.

Along the way he wondered how I find something to write every day. The answer -- I don't find things to write, it doesn't work that way. I don't sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write 1000 words and it doesn't matter what it's about. If I have something to say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say, because I'm always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get there. A lot of trial and error, let's see if this way of putting it works, or that one, etc. There's a slogan for this -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html&quot;&gt;Narrate Your Work&lt;/a&gt; -- and my work is narratable and creates its own record because I do my work right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it.

				<outline text="Another time I blog about is when I figure something out that I've been trying to understand for a long time, in some cases my whole life. That still happens. The other day I found myself talking with a friend about love, why when someone says &quot;I love you&quot; it doesn't mean what it seems to. Love comes from understanding someone well enough that you know what they desire, what they ache to have, and you to try to help them get it. See all the qualifications in that. Try. Help. Them. In other words, you can love someone when you know them. And you don't give them what they want, you help them get it. You can't love someone who your whole idea of is based on a dream you have about them. That's different. Anyway, lots more to say about all this. It's a recurring topic. It might be the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; topic. Someday they'll invent an AI that can analyze my writing and tell me if I've ever written for any other purpose than being worthy of love.

				<outline text="Starting in September or so I start thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many people care, but it's a good thing for me to do -- to review what makes a blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me -- obviously. We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved. People think &quot;well it's just me and I don't matter&quot; -- which is totally true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least &lt;i&gt;they'll&lt;/i&gt; know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value, which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last year I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915&quot;&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; Heather Cox Richardson, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack site&lt;/a&gt; is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different times, and if I'm up and in the mood, I'll spend a few minutes with HCR and it's always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country. " created="Mon, 11 Dec 2023 13:47:10 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Before moving on to this year's BOTY, I thought HCR could help figure out how we could move past merely reporting on Trump's danger to democracy, something that was clear going back to 2015, the news could start reporting on The Resistance, what we're doing to prevent the end of democracy. And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy things for them to write about! We're not doing that. It started out well, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.&quot;&gt;Woman's March on January 20, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but that was it. We can and must keep showing up, and I'm not advocating huge marches, I want to see neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk (if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music, food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not against something but &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; all of us. All we have to do is figure out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our democracy would be in the best shape it's been in probably since inception. I had another idea that's worth considering. We should all wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a photo of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;Martin Luther King&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but it didn't catch on. If we all did, it's omission would be noticed, and we'd know there's someone we should talk with about America and offer them a free button, nicely, if they'll put it on right now. Anyway, I'm putting this out there again, and I'll keep doing it. " created="Mon, 11 Dec 2023 13:59:26 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/06/17/mlkButton.png"/>

Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/&quot;&gt;Automattic VIP server&lt;/a&gt; required fairly large pieces of the software to be rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run.

				<outline text="An alert to readers who remember how great it was to have Twitter be the meeting place for news people and their stories prior to the Musk takeover. I think Facebook's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads service&lt;/a&gt; is poised to replace Twitter in this role, once they add an API that allows pubs to post links to their stories on their service. We will, in a few weeks or months, wish we had proactively formed a non-Facebook news service, a place where by convention we know we can get links to the hot stories as they become available. I think Bluesky is the perfect place to go for this now, but it would require the company behind the service to work with news orgs and independent software developers to quickly build the network. It's possible. They already have the API, we just need to do a little marketing. It's even possible without the help of Bluesky itself, if a few leaders from the news industry got involved, either individuals like Jay Rosen, Emily Bell or Jeff Jarvis, or Richard Gingras who leads news at Google (who thankfully doesn't have a horse in this race) or a big news org or two, acting proactively against turning this valuable space over to a much untrusted big tech company like Facebook. (I don't call them Meta, I think that was a con to give them cover for exactly a move like this, who would ever trust Facebook with such power after what happened in the 2016 election, but &lt;i&gt;Meta&lt;/i&gt; is just confusing enough.)" created="Sat, 09 Dec 2023 13:18:27 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/09/cuteCat.png" imageLink="http://scripting.com/2023/12/09/134017.html"/>

It is available on newsstands, I did a search and found I could pick it up at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stores.barnesandnoble.com/store/3405&quot;&gt;Barnes &amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/1200+Ulster+Ave,+Kingston,+NY+12401/@41.9651793,-74.0275494,13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89dd0f2c78ed7179:0xe5adbff00343979c!8m2!3d41.9651793!4d-73.9889256!16s%2Fg%2F11bw442113?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;in Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, a 1/2 hour drive from where I live. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-atlantic-magazine/1104733038?ean=2940000280874&quot;&gt;$2.20 per issue&lt;/a&gt;. A fair price imho. I advertised I'd be willing to pay $5 to read all the articles in the special issue about the second Trump presidency. Driving one hour round trip raises the price considerably. 2. A couple of readers wrote to say that the full text of the Atlantic is available in their RSS 2.0 feed. I knew that, but that isn't the issue. It's very generous of The Atlantic to offer their publication that way, but I'm not looking for a free ride, just a fair deal. I might want to subscribe to The Atlantic, what better way to offer it than on a piece-price basis. I might end up paying more than the subscription price. If I was doing that regularly you bet I'd subscribe. 3. I really dislike the term &quot;micropayments.&quot; It's disrespectful of the customer's money, and businesses that do that don't deserve our patronage. When you add up the per-article expense of great pubs like The New Yorker or The Atlantic there would be nothing micro about the money I'd spend. It's the commitment I want to avoid. Magazines are notoriously difficult to unsub from. I'd rather pay more and stay anonymous to them.

He said it clearly, he was just trying to save his conscience for after the Nazis came to power in the US. We have bigger issues than Jeffrey Goldberg's conscience. Why doesn't NPR and The Atlantic go out and find The Freaking Resistance and introduce us to them. My grandfather said something to me when I was a little boy, with such clarity, I can never forget it. He said David, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you need to go up on the roof with a gun, and shoot them. He knew. He didn't say &quot;David, run&quot; or &quot;David, write an article in The Atlantic so you have a clear conscience.&quot; He said I should fight. With guns.

				<outline text="Twitter poisoned our minds with the idea that by taking away the basic features of writing on the web they were encouraging people to write shorter, better, more to-the-point posts and that would make communication on the web like poetry. It was a very zen-like mystical idea, and imho totally wrong. And it's still repeated as if it were gospel -- it's a typical response when I beg for a standard that is more realistic, that incorporates the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;basic features of web writing&lt;/a&gt;: simple styles, links, optional titles, enclosures, the ability to edit and unlimited length. The fallacy of this response is that you are free to write however you want, if you feel your ideas are better communicated in short messages, go ahead. I want to use all the tools in my writing. And if you don't want to read all that I write or any of it, there are tools that make that easy. So everyone wins, and you don't have to try to impose your ideas of religiously pure writing on anyone but yourself.

The idea of being forced to use a teeny little edit box to write my wonderful prose is as silly as bunding a word processor with a printer, and forcing you to use that editor if you want to print it with that printer. If I sent you a document written for my Brand X printer but you had Brand Y, sorry -- you can't read it. I'm at the point in my life where I have to explain to young folk how great things were when I was their age, but it's true in this case, when I was in my 20s and 30s, there were simple standards for text, and you could print documents produced by any writing tool on any printer. And as a result a wide variety of writing tools and editors were available, and there was lots of innovation in a very short period of time because everyone had competition they could learn from and had to keep up with. Now there's no reason for Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, Bluesky, Mastodon or whatever to improve their editors because after all you don't have any choice. That's another important facet of textcasting that we borrow from podcasting -- lots of ways to create and lots of ways to listen mean things &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; get better.

I saw the opportunity in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;January 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a few days before Trump was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;inaugurated&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter had just elected a president. What is the dollar value of that? In the hands of someone who knows how to squeeze money from the US government, as Musk surely does (and Trump had no idea) -- it could be worth many more billions than he paid for Twitter." created="Sat, 02 Dec 2023 16:50:38 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2023/12/02/whatIsElonMuskDoing.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="3080321" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/whiteRabbitFromAliceInWonderland.png"/>
				<outline text="You can live in places where people do awful disgusting things, I know, I've lived in New Orleans, Berkeley and NYC. Twitter is so huge, this idea that it could disband just like that, well it isn't happening. Maybe it's time for us to say clearly what we expect of a social network and try to influence how they run them. We have these great tools for organizing, one of these days we're going to use them for good, in a serious way. And at this point the users have a lot of power relative to what we've had in the past.

				<outline text="I'm cleaning up some loose-ends in the Scripting News redesign, esp in the phone version. After that, I'm going to start applying the same techniques to FeedLand on phones. Our timelines look fine in that context, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/scriptingMobileScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="This is the stupidest thing ever. We've had a bit of trouble with the implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/rssCloud/walkthrough/publisher.html&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; on the new Automattic-hosted server, the pings to coming from one server in particular. We did finally get to the bottom of it and all of a sudden it's working. Except for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I added debugging code, stared at server logs, and scratched my head, until I decided to check if I was subscribed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;freaking feed&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't. Once I fixed that little oversight, it's all &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/02/itworked.png&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt;, nice and fast. Sometimes the bug is in your brain not in the software. :smile:" created="Sat, 02 Dec 2023 18:52:32 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/curly.png"/>

				<outline text="If I could devote myself fulltime to AI development, first thing I'd do is teach a bot how to generate CSS with high level commands from me. After 15 years of wrangling CSS, I still create messes that are impossible to unravel, the only way to fix it is to start over, and then that gets out of control, and on and on. It would take some patience to establish some basic design patterns, but once designed I could say things like &quot;a little less margin on top of the tabs&quot; and boom that would happen.

				<outline text="WordPress.org has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/photos/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; where people share Creative Commons licensed photos.

I keep wanting it back, because I keep watching shows that should be in its database. I miss it. Then I realized it's not that different from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot;&gt;group of explorers&lt;/a&gt; who are putting their app choices into feeds. The Bingeworthy database is people, shows and ratings. The simplest relational database possible. It would be easy to represent each user as a feed, where each item is a rating. The link for each item would be a pointer to the Metacritic page. And then give each feed a category of &lt;i&gt;bingeworthy. &lt;/i&gt;From there, we explore.  BTW, this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/a5b3ac43939954c4af6759a9ce27989f&quot;&gt;SQL code&lt;/a&gt; that creates the BW database.
