If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who will want to impose severe limits.

The RSS-based podcast industry just hasn’t been moving  and if we don’t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get.

When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer asked&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only &quot;RSS&quot;, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.

				<outline text="Ben Thompson wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt; newsletter: &quot;What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective it’s a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!&quot; I wrote in 2017, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;some Repub would buy Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now.

				<outline text="About polls, I learned how they work and how much they are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija&quot;&gt;Ouija board&lt;/a&gt;, where the reports are tuned up based on the pollsters assumptions about who are the real voters, and account for the limited people who can be polled. They're trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking with a few hundred. So they read each others' work, and try not to be too far off the consensus. It's at best an art, at worst they're just press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain directions. Don't overlook that the money is flowing to the same businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but there at least there's objective news to report on, you know -- the score of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded. In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the journalists we have don't report it. There's a lot of inputs that are connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/241102/p54#a241102p54&quot;&gt;top item&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/03/iowapoll.png&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt; is about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/&quot;&gt;poll in Iowa&lt;/a&gt; that says Harris is ahead.

					<outline text="Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that their pitch is a scam, and they're building value in a user base that they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the founders may have already sold some of their stock in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a&quot;&gt;latest investment round&lt;/a&gt; which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.)

					<outline text="I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they're open, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the only way to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; do it is to &quot;provide a download that you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of confusion.&quot; (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too much into their promise of being open.)

					<outline text="I'm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw had an open API too, and it's pretty good, but they never offered the option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else build one of those?

					<outline text="In early 2017 I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a president. This value wasn't on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it could possibly gain him control of part of the US government's $6 trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it doesn’t matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election..

					<outline text="In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it's possible they have a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that's why it's a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would sell out even if they didn't have to. " created="Sun, 03 Nov 2024 14:59:37 GMT"/>

That way I can include your code in mine and vice versa. I can understand what you're doing. Tools can be developed that make it even easier to do things the only way they work. New programming languages if they really are necessary should strive to simplify the programming model, there should be less things for the developer to worry about, the more easily new ideas can be developed, the less attention you have to pay to how you'll do something over what it does. I actually don't support the other half of Postel, in everything but user interface where I do support it. I don't think in general software interfaces should be liberal with what they understand because that defeats the first half. They sort of zero each other out.

				<outline text="We now understand that the Republicans derive their power through division, setting groups against each other. We think the Democrats are the opposite, they are inclusive, everyone is welcome there. But that's not true. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/nx-s1-5154873/what-explains-the-big-gender-gap-between-supporters-of-trump-and-harris&quot;&gt;NPR piece&lt;/a&gt; touches on it, gingerly, because it's the third rail in non-Republican politics. Because it's one of the divisions that's maintained by people who are mostly Democrats. If you want to know if you're part of the problem, measure your own feelings when you find out what it's about. And then listen, carefully to the words. It might be hard to hear because I think most people who do this don't think they do, or they're justified in doing it. They don't want to look here. But the pragmatic reason to focus on this is that in future elections, assuming we have them, if we can make an effort to not do this, we could get enough Republican votes to switch to make real change possible. They might even become our most vocal supporters. Winning in politics is done by focusing on common interests over division.
