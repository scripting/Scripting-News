				<outline text="An advantage of using an outliner to edit a blog, is that you can easily split one post into several because they're edited in one document. Or move a paragraph from one story to another with drag and drop. In a page-oriented editor, you get to focus on the writing for one page, but navigating outside that post is more jarring, a writer more easily loses the train of thought. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/31/outline.png&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; in an outliner almost exclusively for decades, only now considering the writing world outside.

					<outline text="No one attaches their feelings to the things other people say in this context. But sometimes it hurts anyway. I think I've told this story many times. I had posted some example code on the door to the office I shared with a few other teaching assistants at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW&lt;/a&gt; in the late 70s, and there was a mistake in it. It wouldn't have compiled if I had tried to run it. I was told by a TA who was senior to me, never to do this again. It stung for an instant, but I recall suppressing that and accepting that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/146513/what-does-op-mean&quot;&gt;OP&lt;/a&gt; was right. I should never have to learn this lesson again, and as far as I know, many years have passed and I have never have had to re-learn that one (though I have with many others).

					<outline text="But nothing prepared me for the experience in 1981 or so when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCorp&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; I was working for hired a professional tester to report on the software. Page after page of my mistakes. Written in cold dispassionate unyielding text, with no concern for anyone's feelings. And since I was the lead developer on the project, the feelings were pretty much all mine. &lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt; the concerns were valid. Some of the things were the result of confusion about how the product worked, and others were outright mistakes. All of them were my responsibility. Later when I started and ran a company of my own, I hired people to test our software in exactly the same way." created="Sat, 30 Mar 2024 18:39:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Many many years later, if you work with me on a project, I expect you to report problems with my code directly. Please don't beat around the bush. I've been through this a million times. It still stings sometimes, but I recover quickly, because my mission is to make flawless software, a feeling that the &quot;software thinks like I do&quot; that only comes from addressing all the issues you can. No software is ever anything close to perfect. But we strive to make it more perfect. This is the ethos of developers, and why our conversations may sound weird to others.

				<outline text="Working on a big software project is like hiking the Appalachian Trail. You keep a diary so people who come through there next year and the year after will know what you tried and why it didn't work. Like using a GET when the RESTful thing is a POST. I once got excoriated by a famous security expert in public for doing this (XML-RPC only uses POST) but I had and have the best intentions. Back then in 1998, when I made the choice, I was juggling a billion flaming bowling pins. Back then there was no ChatGPT to ask about prior art. I had to move on. Well here we are again in 2024. I hope the next person traveling through the area in question sees what I didn't see. People who have worked on my code know that if you &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/listings/pagepark.html&quot;&gt;read it in an outliner&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see lots of blog posts with extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/28/comments.png&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; that read more like a blog than software. Some functions have a thread of comments going back to the early 90s and not just from me. Outliners are great for writing code, because a long comment takes up exactly one line until you expand it. So you can go on and on and not stop until you're finished.

					<outline text="I've had this problem with other reporters in the past whose owners were caught up in some controversy that made them newsworthy. The reporters refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is where journalism goes wrong imho.

Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It's similar to the &quot;news&quot; she reported on Facebook, except now instead of steering us to believe lies, she's holding it back, and instead of it being about one very powerful social media company, it's about the future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn't know, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something&quot;&gt;Upton Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; once said: “It is difficult to get a [person] to understand something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.” " created="Tue, 26 Mar 2024 12:33:10 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png"/>

This was emphatically not Game of Thrones, though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn't get much screentime in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing, they don't pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes, incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On the other hand it's like so much of today's TV, superheros, epic conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game&quot;&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/a&gt;.

Doesn't seem like it's something Google is doing to punish me for using HTTP, though that is always the first thing that comes to mind. I tried moving the XML-RPC site to a different server, but the problem follows it. No changes have been made to the site in years. Not exactly what I had planned to be digging into on a nice (but cold) Sunday morning in the mountains. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/299&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;, if you have any insights.

This blogroll is much like the one I had in the 00s, but it's in motion, and it's a source of news and ideas. It's also doing the thing that Twitter used to do, it lets me have a way to see what specific people are interested in. I expect more of that as new people get this kind of blogroll. Right now I'm pretty much the only one. The next step is getting the blogroll running in WordPress. And then getting it running on &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/&quot;&gt;Om's blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/&quot;&gt;Doc's blog&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom have real experience with the art of blogrolling. From that, I expect to have a better idea of what the editorial UI should look like for people creating and managing these blogrolls. We'll iterate until it's pretty easy to set up and manage one. Also to be clear, I want it to run in other platforms, this is not exclusive to WordPress. It's just the place where the people are right now, the ones I really want to work with. But I wouldn't mind it running in &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; for example, if there are any writers there who find this compelling.

However, if we &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; aiming to be as smart and knowledgable as possible, we'd be losing to them anyway. The machines have infinitely expandable memory, and we don't and we lose stuff, and we hallucinate a lot more than they do.

					<outline text="So for example, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;, which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed. This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the file system. The product didn't live long enough to fulfill the potential of that feature.

					<outline text="Another random morning bit -- something subtle in the blogroll you might not have noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts.

But the feed reader folk ignored that guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it's pretty simple. &lt;span&gt;If it doesn't have a title use the description&lt;/span&gt;.

					<outline text="There's a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some don't. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn't show that difference that in the user interface. The users don't care and rightly so. It's confusing and takes their attention away from the writing. " created="Thu, 21 Mar 2024 13:24:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress's RSS feeds. If I start a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for the post. That's the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title, which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs shouldn't change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don't know if they can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can't depend on the title being there. " created="Thu, 21 Mar 2024 13:18:46 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a &lt;i&gt;social web,&lt;/i&gt; and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections.

He has a competitive grace you don't see very often. Quickley was one of those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team, he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the Raptors, but we lost something important there.

					<outline text="The Knicks have been slumping since two of their top players have been out with injuries for over a month, after having an amazing January. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; of the two star players came back last night, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39718456/og-anunoby-lifts-knicks-blowout-win-76ers-return&quot;&gt;what a difference&lt;/a&gt;! They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson&quot;&gt;one player&lt;/a&gt;, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab&quot;&gt;second injured player&lt;/a&gt; comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! :heart: " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 12:27:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html&quot;&gt;MacWrite and MacPaint&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account.

				<outline text="BTW, in case you're wondering where &quot;still diggin!&quot; came from -- here's the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it's a lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there's more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It's like &quot;even worse than it appears.&quot; Still diggin is meant to say we know it's really futile, you don't have to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we feel somehow that next time it really will work. It's a Vonnegut-like or Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other words, realistic. " created="Tue, 05 Mar 2024 17:05:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

Not some fancy media critic opinion or an editorial. A real report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability.&quot; A regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her liking, she accused me of being a MAGA.

We &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing.
