Biden has a base. He should communicate directly with us. Joe, tell us you saw what we saw. A snake oil salesman. A con man. A loser. A criminal. We heard the tape of him blackmailing the Secretary of State of Georgia. He wanted the military to shoot Black Lives Matter protestors. Did he sell our secrets to Putin and others? He did all kinds of horrible stuff that the press has forgotten to talk about. The biggest problem here isn't Biden's age, though it is a problem, it's the controlling nature of our journalism, and the lack of any oversight. They can't be criticized because all we have are our individual voices, with no organization. We keep paying the price. This podcast is in the form of a voicemail to an old friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who I introduce at the beginning of the podcast. We share the same frustrations, I can see it in his posts on various social media networks. I'd like to elevate our discourse. And in the meantime, imho, it's a pretty good story. &lt;i&gt;10 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;  :smile:" created="Sun, 30 Jun 2024 14:04:56 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2024/06/30/myOpenVoicemailToALongtimeFriendAboutTheNYTimes.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="5236440" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/30/podcastLogo.png"/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+ChatGPT&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; provides better support for other people's products than they do. For example, I signed up for a trial subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britbox.com/&quot;&gt;BritBox&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon Prime, and a few days later decided I didn't want to continue. Amazon is famous for having terrible docs, in every part of the system. They made it basically impossible for me to quickly find the place where you unsubscribe. Okay so I asked ChatGPT and it knew how to do it, and I was unsubscribed in a few seconds. This feature pays for the whole $20 this month, everything else is a bonus. " created="Sun, 30 Jun 2024 21:48:54 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Another example. Something seemed screwed up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+caddy&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful product, makes it super easy to support HTTPS. But the docs were written by programmers, and thus lack a user's perspective. Pretty common thing, and hard to avoid. So I asked ChatGPT questions to help me dig into the problem. It's annoyingly overly verbose, it answers questions I didn't ask, and thus wastes time, but -- in about ten minutes it put something on a checklist which turned out to be the problem. It's hard to debug a system problem you weren't expecting to have. The robot doesn't need to have its memory refreshed, unlike my 69-year-old human brain.

					<outline text="When I write these little stories I hope to counter the fear hype out there, because ChatGPT is an amazingly useful breakthrough product. I'm always finding new incredible uses for it. Products like this come along at most every twenty years or so. I've created some good software in my life, but nothing like this. This is like the Beatles or the web. It's that difference-making. " created="Sun, 30 Jun 2024 21:58:19 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The debate got the presidential race to another level. It also caused the NYT et al to fully decloak. It was impossible to watch, but it was also honest. We all knew but pretended we didn't that Biden has the kind of trouble he has. We voted for him anyway in 2020, and we will again in 2024. And Trump, what he did was worse than lying, it's a con job, because as soon as he takes office he's going to surrender to Putin. And stop fighting climate change. And destroy what's left of our democracy. And open the concentration camps and make the Jews pay for it. Biden can be president, the news orgs have to decide to let him be and stop trying to control the rest of us. We can make this work.

It tells the story of RSS as a remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in 1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the &lt;i&gt;entire news world supported RSS.&lt;/i&gt; That's the story. You can write all about who did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn't work with each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course until the real story is out there, we can't learn from it. This is a 14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the sites it points to.

				<outline text="I'm working on a server app to read blogroll source in OPML, and build a database of other blogrolls that are linked to feeds in the original blogroll, accessed via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/blogroll.opml&quot;&gt;feed or html source&lt;/a&gt;. It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for &lt;a href=&quot;https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription lists&lt;/a&gt; back in the 00s that it included the &lt;i&gt;htmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute, it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I'm using a SQL database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I thought &quot;no big deal&quot; it's a variant of a SQL table I've now done a dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I've yet to come up with a way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at runtime. That's how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be factored. This probably doesn't make sense to too many people, maybe it won't even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I've moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I'm sure it's possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of them, which is why I'm taking my break from &lt;i&gt;The Next Product&lt;/i&gt; to do this.

				<outline text="By my calculations this is the 365th consecutive month of publication for my humble blog. Are there any longer-running blogs in the world? " created="Sat, 01 Jun 2024 16:48:35 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="The outline for May 2024 has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2024/05.opml&quot;&gt;safely tucked away&lt;/a&gt; for posterity on the Scripting News repo. " created="Sat, 01 Jun 2024 16:40:07 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html&quot;&gt;The last post for last month&lt;/a&gt; is one you should read if you read nothing else on this blog ever. It's the story of tech. Something new and explosive comes out, and the journalists feel threatened by it (always, in every way, even when it has nothing to do with them) and a few others (music industry with Napster, artists with ChatGPT) see amateurs invading their previously exclusive space. Truth is these new technologies give new tools for expression of ordinary untrained people. Now we get to have fun with sharing what we see, and maybe the professionals have to reorient themselves to the rest of the world. One thing you can't do and hope not to be left behind, is ignore the new tech, if you want to understand, don't depend on what you read in the news orgs, because they are always full of shit about new tech. You have to go discover it for yourself. And when someone says they're blown away by the new stuff they can do, listen to them, don't argue, try to understand. There's a lot of growth locked up in understanding. So please read the piece, we're at one of those points now wrt to ChatGPT. Sure, it knows a lot of stuff, that's great, but there's also it's ability to listen and understand us. This is what's really new here.

				<outline text="Sometimes the On This Day feature in Facebook surfaces some questions that should be asked regularly. For example. 1. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid02MA2JoTwY1oEYhuxmhuvarmVsaMqX6Gi6dADc3i8C8acFK3j3xNdw6W8GrG2vnoNgl&quot;&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt; what do librarians think of ChatGPT. Only one response. Maybe more this year. If there are any librarians blogging about their experiences with ChatGPT, please send me a link and I will add them to my AI category. If &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; is writing about new discoveries they've made, I want to hear about it. " created="Sat, 01 Jun 2024 18:24:26 GMT" type="outline"/>
