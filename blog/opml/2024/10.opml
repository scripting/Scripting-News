				<outline text="I did the first demo of my new editor to a couple of developers I'm working with on our ActivityPub project, something I'm ever-more-excited about. Happy to say the demo was a success. They appeared to love the product, and for the right reasons. It makes WordPress into a fantastic writer's platform. This is what I love to do more than anything. People think I'm most interested in protocols and formats, but that's just part of it, and not the main part. I love making writing tools. I got interested in that in the late 70s working on editors for programming languages, then ran a company that made the same kind of editor, outliners, for writers, and then with Frontier went back to programmers. Now I'm trying something new. I want to create a whole category of editors. Editors where none existed before but should be there. The web. Instead what we have in 2024 is a lot of &quot;tiny little text boxes&quot; that hoard your writing making it pointless for developers to compete for writing tools that writers love. So writing on the web remains something that's not for writers. That's freaking stupid! Anyway right in the middle of all this is the perfect product, really a platform -- WordPress. It needs 100 great editors. I'm going to provide the first, and the toolkit to create more. Then Murphy-willing I'm going to create another editor, to show that it can be done. Then I'm going to kick back and smell the roses, a lifetime's work done, so now I can play. It's looking like the plan might just work." created="Thu, 31 Oct 2024 13:41:40 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/30/grannySmithApple.png"/>

Only the US has vastly more wealth. And unlike Trump, Musk understands how money works, presumably Putin does too. They want the entire flow of cash that's generated by the US economy to go through them. So &quot;richest man in the world&quot; doesn't begin to cover Musk's ambition.

				<outline text="The Major League Baseball season is finally over. The no-philosophy mess in the Bronx was near-swept by the infidels from California, on their home field no less, so we expect Jankee Estadium to be either haunted in perpetuity or torn down (latter solution preferable) and replaced with something more appropriate, hopefully &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; far from Queens, maybe they'd consider moving to California too? Since the Jankees fans only sanction winning, I don't imagine too many would mind if they had to hate them from afar? And now NY baseball is united in our disrespect for the so-called Bronx Bombers, whose bombs were duds this year. Anyway the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/125035.html&quot;&gt;Mets did better&lt;/a&gt; against the Dodgers in the NLCS, and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani&quot;&gt;star hitter&lt;/a&gt; wasn't injured when the lovable Metsies played them. The Mets scored far more runs and of course far more philosophy. And in a desperate attempt to win, when losing was already baked-in, two Janks fans were ejected for trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-series-fan-interference-cd45ba4968dbf6f68b0a6c375a286557&quot;&gt;interfere&lt;/a&gt; with a Dodger outfielder on a stinking foul ball! I mean if you want to try to steal the game, at least have the good sense to interfere with a home run? Not too smart. Oh well. At least the Janks were humiliated, a bright spot for baseball in the Big Apple. " created="Thu, 31 Oct 2024 13:29:35 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/18/grimace.png"/>

If owning the Post would interfere with his other businesses in a negative way, and if the problem could be solved by dropping it, I don't doubt that he would do that. Then why this op-ed? It could be that someone in his family objected, sometimes people react to that in ways that could cost money. It's possible. It's also possible that he's not sure that Trump will win, and being a calculating person, he realizes now that he's created a similar problem for himself if the Democrats win. The Trumps won't care if he lies about the reason, so lying about the reason was the obvious path for him.

I agree with everything he said. Really glad that people with clear mind and purpose are using our medium to do the good we hoped for. Best part was where he quoted Obama agreeing that things don't change when you elect a new president. Change can't come that fast unless we bring a substantial majority of other Americans with us. The vote isn't a way to make change, it isn't a way to express yourself, it's &lt;i&gt;your role in governing&lt;/i&gt; our country. It's not the First Amendment or the Second Amendment, it's the whole Constitution. It's the most power every one of us gets. Even the president doesn't have the power of our votes. You don't get a specific result from your vote, that would be the fascism that we're trying to avoid. It's the consenus that build that makes the difference. And Obama is too modest because he made at least a couple of big changes. First, everyone has a right to health insurance now because we elected Obama. That's no small deal, coming from someone who has depended on health insurance to survive, a couple of times. And second, we stirred the racial pot in this country in a positive way. Not to say we got peace and love as a result. Because there are a lot of white folks who don't want that pot stirred. But that was change nonetheless. The only way we get there, and I've said this many times, is by working together. Blame is powerless. Acceptance is powerful.

				<outline text="Lots of Yankees fans at the Garden yesterday to see the great Knicks team of last year show up for the first time. The game in Boston on Tuesday was disheartening. It's a new team with the core of last year's team.

This is the &lt;i&gt;inconvenience&lt;/i&gt; of being a Knicks fan who hates the freaking Yankees. We have to share an NBA team. The Knicks are much more like the Mets than that other team. That's why it's so incredible to see the 2024 Knicks be able to manage both ends of the court, and completely shut down a team that last year beat them in playoffs, the Pacers, just like last year, but better. A validation of everything. Now the team has to stay healthy. But, even if they don't fly the Nazi flag at Trump's rally tomorrow, you know that they want to, and some of them probably brought them.

Yes, a lot of them died during Biden's tenure too. But I don't think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled, first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter, then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;.

So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don't tell me I'm biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump.

And the most important thing -- they don't break users. The code I wrote to run against WordPress in the 00s still runs today. To me as a developer this speaks very loudly. It means it's safe to develop here. It means there's discipline in their development organization. Most companies don't do this, but the ones who do, have earned my deep respect. For all of Microsoft's sins, they were incredibly good at this too. It's why I liked working with them, and also why we laughed at each others' jokes if you can believe that. In some ways all the open source stuff is too complicated. I understand the concept of &quot;development org&quot; -- so I look at it that way. I dig around their codebase, see how they do things, and figure it'll work out pretty well if I just do it that way. Because the last people they're going to break are themselves. What I see on their latest APIs is maturity and completeness. They didn't rush off to the next thing before finishing. I found that in their Calypso API, which I've been building on.

				<outline text="The question has come up in various contexts, is a Substack feed a blog? Yes, I think it can be. For some reason people thought I'd say no. In 2003, I compiled a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/&quot;&gt;things that make a blog a blog&lt;/a&gt;, and it's not about the software you use, rather it's about who's writing it, and whether they're being edited. Now it's a different question to ask if I would use it. I would not. Because it forces you to use their editor. And that's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=pernicious&quot;&gt;pernicious&lt;/a&gt; form of lock-in. It might sound like a small thing, but it means you can't easily try out something new. You are not available to other software developers as a possible user, so no software will be designed for you. I know how well that kind of system works. And that's probably why they lock you into using their editor. If I can't switch without breaking everything, I'm not going there.

				<outline text="Mathew Ingram &lt;a href=&quot;https://tormentnexus.substack.com/p/is-ai-going-to-save-us-or-kill-us&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; if AI will save us or kill us. It could both save and kill us. That's what's so disturbing about evolving. We live such short lives, people aren't really designed to evolve, but because of medicine and other tech, we are often forced to do it. Evolution can come many ways. Losing a job may force you to evolve. The dissolution of a marriage. Having life-saving surgery with a long recovery saves you for sure, but it might also kill you because you can't go back to being the person you were before. There might not be a path back. One thing's for sure we &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; saving. We can't survive without radical change. We're on a path that doesn't work. Is there any way for us to change radically without a complete collapse? Well, actually kind of looks like we might have been given a path out through AI. But it means we must give up control. But here's the funny thing about that. We aren't giving up anything because no one has any control. That's a political question in the US, can one person become a mad king and thus gain complete control. But he's 78 and not in good health, and that control could only last a few years at most. We will need saving from that. If somehow we could configure AI so it did what humans can't and won't do, at least our civilization might have a way forward if not our species. Just some random thoughts. Maybe unthinkable, but they occur to me anyway, which is why I have a blog.  :smile:" created="Thu, 17 Oct 2024 14:51:40 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/04/29/gecko.png"/>

This morning I wrote about why I don't believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets pitcher Tug McGraw. It's on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter how it turns out I won't love the Mets any less if they lose. I think true believers believe in that -- love -- without any expectations, win or lose, or maybe &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering of the post isn't complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I'm working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I'm glad to see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in the things I believe in, not because I &quot;gotta.&quot; I don't like the slogan because it doesn't reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand that their fans don't love them any less because they lost. If anything I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wait+till+next+year!&quot;&gt;Wait till next year!&lt;/a&gt; :smile:" created="Thu, 17 Oct 2024 13:44:43 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/04/melo.png"/>

				<outline text="What's up with WordPress?" created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:07:49 GMT" type="outline" description="My story about weblogs.com and how it relates to what's happening with WordPress now. ">
					<outline text="A long time ago I ran a free service &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/faq&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/http://weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+weblogs.com&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;RSS&quot; didn't exist yet, so there was no way to find out which blogs had new stuff other than going through your blogroll and clicking links. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:00:47 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="So I built a simple server, running in &quot;Frontier&quot;, that handled pings. When you updated your blog, you'd send a message to weblogs.com saying your blog updated. It would then read the HTML of the blog and verify that it changed, and it would be added to a list of blogs that updated, in reverse chronologic order. It also published an XML version of the update list called &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/changesXml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt;, so if you wanted to run a search engine off the list, you could do that too. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:09:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There were several ways to send a ping. You could go to a web page and enter the URL of your blog. Or you could save the URL as a bookmark and click the bookmark when you updated. Or if you used blogging software like our Manila or Radio UserLand, or later EditThisPage.com or weblogs.com (which eventually hosted blogs itself), it could ping on your behalf, automatically. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:09:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Aside: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/historyOfWeblogs&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the weblogs.com site, preserved. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:42:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A number of search sites appeared. And we were happy, until another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt;, funded by venture capitalists, who expected a return on their investment, built on our open and free &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/changes.xml&quot;&gt;changes.xml&lt;/a&gt; list, started asking for and receiving pings on their own, and (key point) they didn't make their change list public. This struck me as highly un-weblike and unfair, but they could do it and we had to live with it. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:09:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Based on what Matt has been saying it sounds to me like it's something like our experience. Except weblogs.com was a short term thing, and not a business, and it didn't last twenty years, and it didn't have a payroll to support. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:12:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But it still felt wrong that they weren't giving back as they received. If it had persisted like WordPress has, it would have eventually been a seriously diseconomic and unsustainable problem. And I can imagine I might write about it publicly as Matt has  and maybe even get a famous lawyer like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal&quot;&gt;Neal Katyal&lt;/a&gt; to advise me. And here we are. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:13:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Have we heard anything from the other side, or anyone who is familiar with what their position might be.

					<outline text="I can't imagine that Matt would make such a big deal out of this if it weren't actually a big deal. He probably knew in advance how disruptive this would be. And I imagine the others knew it would be too and counted on him not wanting to make a fuss. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:14:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have gotten embroiled in these kinds of things in the past, and I don't like it. I love to make software and make users happy and then make more software, round and round. Anything that involves lawyers is not me doing what I was made to do. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:15:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And I do see a silver lining. As with twitter-like systems, I now see the possibilty to help WordPress serve writers better in the future. Before this, people didn't think change was possible in the WordPress world, like they didn't see the possibility of change with Twitter. But now Twitter has quite a bit of viable competition. I know that WordPress could be better tuned for writers, and the product has a very nice API that would make it possible for lots of writing tools to flourish. It is a strong platform that's debugged, scaled, documented and worked on for a long time, and they don't tend to break users. And where commercial vendors like Facebook and Twitter often have excellent technology, ultimately they are run by execs and bankers who don't believe in being open, where this is something that has been deeply ingrained in the WordPress culture from the beginning and would be hard to change and that's a good thing for users and developers. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:15:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's the exciting part -- between WordPress and Twitter lies a product that would bring the web back to life. Imagine a twitter-like system with the writers features of WordPress. Amazingly, we are on the cusp of that being a reality." created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:31:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's lots of opportunity to better serve writers here, and that's what I love to do, and honestly I think Ghost and Substack have left themselves open to a writing environment built on WordPress that doesn't try to lock users in. And at the same time, I think we can use this platform to help all the twitter-like services to support all kinds of writing, not just severely limited tweets typed into &quot;tiny little text boxes&quot;. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong idea that taking features out of the web was a good thing. I want to bring these features back so we can get going again with the web as a writer's platform. " created="Tue, 15 Oct 2024 17:18:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I don't need to think anyone is right or wrong here, and I don't think anyone else should either. I think this platform is very nicely open and we can do lots of interesting new stuff here. I hope to open a new thread here, focused on writers and the web. It's been too long.

I explained why in one of my posts, but it comes down to this. I have most of the features I asked for in &quot;textcasting&quot; (!) and I am typing in a respectable editing window, where I retain copies of my writing, and there's no freaking &quot;tiny little text box&quot;.

				<outline text="Quick note about last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu-LZvntCf8&quot;&gt;Mets win over Philly&lt;/a&gt;. The series is over, the next game on Sunday will be against the winner in the west, either San Diego or Los Angeles. Last night's game was stressful, low scoring, until the Mets star shortstop hit a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/video/francisco-lindor-hits-a-grand-slam-1-to-center-field-starling-marte-score&quot;&gt;freaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;grand slam&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/francisco-lindor-sends-mets-to-the-nlcs-eliminates-phillies-with-grand-slam-in-nlds-game-4-035006801.html&quot;&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;, and that was all the scoring we needed. The Mets are the hottest team in baseball. It doesn't feel like a long time since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; when they got to the World Series before crashing. Who knows how far we'll get this year, honestly -- I'm surprised (and pleased) we got this far. And in the meantime, I caught a tiny bit of last night's preseason game between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bulletsforever.com/2024/10/9/24266653/washington-wizards-new-york-knicks-nba-preseason-game-recap&quot;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt; and some other team I don't care about. They have two new stars to add to the roster after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/isaiah-hartenstein-2024-free-agency&quot;&gt;losing one star&lt;/a&gt; as a free agent, and trading two others for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/karl-anthony-towns-trade-knicks-timberwolves&quot;&gt;second new star&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, very enticing. New York has some excellent sports teams, which is unusual, because it isn't just the Jankees this time, a team I will, I promise, &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; root for. Quite the opposite. I will root for whoever they are playing. You can probably tell I don't like them. :smile:" created="Thu, 10 Oct 2024 15:59:59 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/10/ronaldMcGrimace.png"/>

					<outline text="The evangelist for a product or organization is the person who deliberately tilts the playing field in favor of developer products that absolutely must get out there for the organization to achieve its mission. How is the tilt determined? Intuitively. If some random schmuck approaches him out of the blue at a developer conference, and explains their problem, where most BigCo people ignore them, the evangelist listens carefully. Helps without a second thought. And his door is open, if the developer wants to follow up. He helps route his needs through the organization. No developer is on their own if Guy is there.

					<outline text="And when the killer product comes along, the one that will give Mac users something to get charged up over in 1986 when the hardware problems were being solved (they were!) and the software flow had dried up, Guy gets the developer the $400K they need to keep the doors open to ship the freaking product. The level playing field approach, which most tech companies follow, results in dead developers and platforms whose capabilities go unexplored. Users get bored, and move on to where the excitement is. " created="Tue, 08 Oct 2024 16:16:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've seen products and companies fail to look around them to see what's possible. They only look inward at their own organizations who fail year after year to create products that users love.

					<outline text="I've applied Guy's teaching in every project I've done since I got to know him in 1983 and when we, together, rode the wave of success in the Mac in 1986.

				<outline text="I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/06/155950.html&quot;&gt;roundup of thoughts&lt;/a&gt; when this blog turned 25. I stand by what I wrote then, but I'd add this. My blog started because I needed content to test a script I had written that sent emails on my Mac using &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt;, which was an early &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/apps/Eudora.html&quot;&gt;scriptable app&lt;/a&gt; and I had a nice scripting system that worked with it. I looked around for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/07/marccantersingsagain.html&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; to send (30 years ago today), and shot out an email to the people whose business cards I had collected at various tech conferences. It was a thrill, so I did it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/12/marcs10things.html&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/13/lettertocannavino.html&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/14/howtoinvestinpdas.html&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/16/randybattatonpdas.html&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/17/pdasonparade.html&quot;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;, before I realized hey I could use this thing to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;my own ideas&lt;/a&gt; out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. And thus began &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this thing&lt;/a&gt; that I still do to this day. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/10/06/142657.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about WordPress in the last few days. There may be hope to find a blogosphere buried somewhere in there. And it may be possible to give them some sweet new writing tools so they can get excited about writing on the web the way we did all those years ago. I actually am kind of optimistic about that. Maybe we can stand up something in the midst of the noise. When we booted up podcasting, approx 20 years ago, we had a slogan -- &quot;Users and developers party together.&quot; It worked! That is still the way I want to build stuff, it's the only way I know how to do it. Blogging started out as a programming adventure and eventually became a form of literature. How about that. I'm up for doing more of that if you all are. But please expect to make contributions, don't expect it all to come to you for free, because as we know nothing really is free.

The verbs and nouns will, at least at first, be pretty much exactly like we do it now, but the way you specify how they work, how they interact both in the UI and on the backend, will be done more or less as you would document the user interface. The AI system is almost ready to work at that level. With a few more iterations by human designers it should all meet up in a place where the slogging type work I've been doing for 50+ years will be obsolete. We will all become anachronisms. All of us.

We all revert to our comfortable roles. The question is can we rise above that and forget for a moment what our ancestors taught us as gospel and take an interest in going beyond that, or do we have to do another loop around the genocide and its consequences, which this time will be &lt;i&gt;far worse&lt;/i&gt; than they were in the 1940s because of all the new war and computer tech and the damage done by the post-war growth.

					<outline text="A few ideas -- not in any particular order:" created="Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:07:39 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true">
						<outline text="From my point of view, blogging and the &quot;social web&quot;, WordPress is being built &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt; more than being built on, when it is such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;potent&lt;/a&gt; and surprisingly open &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt;. I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is a strong foundation that you could build &lt;i&gt;any kind of writing software&lt;/i&gt; on. " created="Sun, 06 Oct 2024 14:19:07 GMT"/>
						<outline text="If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we'd be compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; are amazing. I don't say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The company desperately needs an evangelism function.)" created="Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:34:18 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the &quot;social web&quot;. The comparison between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one (which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the Facebook platform, btw -- and from a software design perspective it's brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpidentity&lt;/a&gt; package I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election Facebook's API was radically restricted, not something many people know about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn't appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory their server could be cloned (it's open source) but it certainly could be emulated at an API level.

						<outline text="It's enticing. All those users -- there should be a market for writing tools there, but there isn't. Why is that??" created="Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:03:54 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I feel like we're like ships passing in the night. I thought I should point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction I don't understand and don't see why I should want to. Did they care when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original blogosphere? I don't see any evidence of it. It's like Walmart sought to build a shopping center on the remains of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria&quot;&gt;Library of Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;. People don't seem to have any respect for independent writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and &lt;i&gt;the dream was realized.&lt;/i&gt; No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And no wonder journalism doesn't defend it, they are offended by the idea of people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we do. We're their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming." created="Sun, 06 Oct 2024 14:33:22 GMT"/>

He's doing more to focus attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge, something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn't have to wait for Matt to turn in that direction. " created="Sun, 06 Oct 2024 14:37:16 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Briefly, because I have stuff to do -- the Mets were down 1-0 in the bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks like it's going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time down and to the right. You could try to swing but you'd have to be very lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they took out Wheeler (pitchers don't do complete games any longer, they used to).

Two main screens, a streamlined UI. You could get in quickly, write and publish a post in a minute, and see it show up in the reader a moment later.

A deeper truth of the Mets was we didn't really mind when they lost. Because underneath it all at a whole other level, the Mets have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that is strong.

It's pretty short. We knew what we were doing. We loved what RSS did for news. Now we were doing the same for radio. Not just talking about it, but finally -- doing it.

					<outline text="When I was looking for information about podcasting, I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/09/29/palfrey.jpg&quot;&gt;tiny picture&lt;/a&gt; of JP in the margin of a post about BloggerCon, on the archive for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/09/29.html&quot;&gt;9/29/2004&lt;/a&gt;, clicked the link and it's gone. Apparently it wasn't part of the archive that Automattic is hosting. That's too bad because there were a lot of &quot;firsts&quot; at the top level of the site, but it may have gotten lost when the site was converted from &quot;Manila&quot; to WordPress quite a few years ago. But they were able to find a snapshot of the page &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20030604105516/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stories/storyReader$291&quot;&gt;on archive.org&lt;/a&gt; (I had looked but came up empty) and there is this amazing picture of Palfrey that I had been looking for and never found, and now it is found once again.

Some of them &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; dead and gone. I had to remind myself of that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.)
