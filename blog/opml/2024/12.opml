It's not polite to say it's exhausting and boring, and seems pointless. Then I happened to hear Jimmy Carter himself, on the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/12/30/g-s1-40405/former-president-jimmy-carter-the-fresh-air-interviews-part-1&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Fresh Air podcast, and that was fantastic and totally worthwhile.

Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there's a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the software would make it so that only the author of the post being responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they thought everyone should see it.

Then Dave showed me a more sophisticated design with rounded rectangles and arrows, so I adapted my approach and created a matching SVG version." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:51:23 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The most interesting moment came when Dave casually asked if I could turn this into a Node.js package. This was an audacious request - moving from a single visualization to a complete, reusable software package - but it was exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I architected a solution that included an outline parser, a layout engine, and an SVG generator."/>
						<outline text="I particularly enjoyed designing the two-pass layout algorithm. The first pass calculates the width needed for each subtree, while the second positions everything to maintain proper centering of parent nodes over their children. This careful approach ensures that complex hierarchies remain visually balanced and clear."/>
						<outline text="When Dave expressed amazement at the result, I realized this interaction exemplified something important: AI assistants aren't just code generators, but can be thoughtful collaborators in the software development process. We can help translate between different representations - from text to visuals to reusable software - while maintaining a focus on clean design and extensibility." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:51:27 GMT"/>

The web is programmable, our operating systems are, of course the AI-o-verse will be programmable too. We are able to create entirely new development environments, these platforms deserve a fresh new look at &lt;i&gt;everything.&lt;/i&gt; I'd also like to note that at the same time, the platforms are breaking through in web user interfaces. Remarkable progress. Far beyond what we were doing in the very stagnant Web 2.0 world. They're still stuck on whether or not our writing can have titles.

				<outline text="Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is &quot;textcasting&quot;. It was what I needed to build &quot;WordLand&quot;, it defines its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of. Defining a new network where if you want to play you'll need to start thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can't be on the open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into copying and pasting into &quot;tiny little text boxes&quot;, that's how you know you're in a silo. If you can use any writing tool to post to a network, then it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; on the web. Pretty simple. Right now -- &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of the popular ones qualify. None.

				<outline text="I like to share posts from Threads on Bluesky and Mastodon to illustrate the incompatibility, the ignorance of one to the other. These guys should all be using the same protocol. It's a travesty that each of them considers their product to define the &quot;social web&quot; -- they don't understand the first thing about the web, what the miracle the web was. Before the web, the tech world was as it is now, fragmented by huge companies that didn't care about anything but their own internal drama. The last thing they would consider was reusing something that was already running. While all that was going on Unix basically agreed on a core set of functions that formed a basis for interop. They weren't perfect, there were differences in each of the Unixes, but you could reuse most of what you knew on each of the platforms. But Apple, Microsoft, Sun and IBM each ran their own ecosystems. And then one day along came the web. Instead of bookshelves of docs, it wasn't even a booklet. You could be up and running with a &quot;website&quot; in ten minutes. I speak from experience. My first website was authored with a freaking email. Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon are the IBM, Microsoft and Apple of 2024. It's ridiculous if they think this is a web.

The feature I want is when you paste a URL and there's a selection, the selected text is turned into a link. A video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQQPTlpNZQ&quot;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;. I've burned two full sessions on this, seeking advice from ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. They all pretend to know what to do, but in fact they don't. The clipboard is one of those areas of the browser that is held together with rumors and confusion, as is MediumEditor, and the intersection is rumors and confusion squared. Tomorrow I'm going to work on other things, and the day after until I have an idea for another way to approach this. I really want this feature because apparently it's supported in Slack, WordPress and other software that supports links.

Interesting to see that they use Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I'm not sure how or if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it's good for. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very slow.

I find that I'll like almost anything that's rated in the 80s by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I'll give almost any NYT &lt;i&gt;critics choice&lt;/i&gt; a go. So what I really want in the middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well. Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy).

Aggregate all the shows from all the feeds in a list into a single feed. This seems brilliant because it reduces the implementation in the client to almost nothing, just rebuild a feed periodically, it could be done entirely in the client app. But it also could be something users could share with other users, sort of a meta-channel. I think it's brilliant with the caveat that sometimes when you implement it you find something that makes it more complex than it seems at first. This is the second idea I've heard that the initial listening lists idea spawned. I think there's a lot of unexplored possibilities here.
