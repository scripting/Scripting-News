There are a few unreleased products that use the same approach. The way we read the web hasn't received enough attention, we've been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces, forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We've settled for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well. I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I'm saving that for a big reveal at some point.

					<outline text="Molly White wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/&quot;&gt;great piece&lt;/a&gt; on the problem we're all facing now that so many of us are trying to maintain a presence on a few different social web sites. She describes a situation I've been writing about since the mid-late 00s, with the inception of Twitter and Google Reader, two phenoms that had very different ideas of what writing on the web should be. That's where the problems started." created="Sat, 28 Sep 2024 13:33:23 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/14/weTryHarder.png"/>
					<outline text="Before that we had a cross-posting API that was broadly supported and really worked, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0's idea&lt;/a&gt; of what a post is. It's called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt;, and it's still supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_MetaWeblog_API&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; and probably a few other social web sites (I take a broad view of what the social web is and definitely include WordPress and other blogging tools. Based on Molly's piece, I expect she would see it that way too.)" created="Sat, 28 Sep 2024 14:24:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The first approach I took to this problem was to cross-post as Molly describes, to work around the limits in software. But the limits will creep into your writing, since you know that people who read your stuff on Bluesky, Threads or Twitter won't see the links, you'll be reluctant to them in your writing. I encountered this problem in the mid-teens when I was trying to cross-post to Medium and Facebook, one supported links and basic HTML, the other didn't. Eventually before &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;giving up&lt;/a&gt; on the POSSE approach in 2017, I was barely using links at all. I was trying to keep four pieces of software happy and doing so made my writing suck." created="Sat, 28 Sep 2024 13:50:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To get a handle on the problem, I created a list of features I felt all social web platforms should support and published it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting.org&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately I think we're going to have to make a platform that implements a reasonable subset of this functionality, if only as a demo for the social web companies to show them what we want. There already are Mastodon forks that support some of the features (no character limit, Markdown support). " created="Sat, 28 Sep 2024 13:41:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting&quot;&gt;published the code&lt;/a&gt; I use to cross-post for my linkblog, that much does work quite well across the different platforms, and I'd be happy to operate a server for people to experiment with. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js&quot;&gt;server software&lt;/a&gt; runs in Node.js, is already open source. It has a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main/plugins/platforms&quot;&gt;plug-in architecture&lt;/a&gt; so support for new platforms can be added without modifying the server. " created="Sat, 28 Sep 2024 13:55:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But my main point is this -- let's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt;. We really aren't very good in tech at building on each others' work, that's why we get so stuck. I have a lot to say about that too, I've been writing about it on my blog for many many years.

				<outline text="When markets have dominant products, evolution freezes. Google search, for example. I should have great search for my blog by now, powered by Google. It has been here for 26 years. They should have been doing R&amp;D on how they can be part of a better reading environment on the web. But reading on the web has just gotten worse over the years. It's why we don't like clicking on links, usually what we find at the other end of the link is obnoxious. To get some peace and quiet we had to go to Twitter of all places, but now that's gotten ridiculous too. The only corner of the web where there's real exciting innovation is ChatGPT. And what's tragic about that is we've never made search work on the web, and search is valuable too, not just the digested version of what was said that ChatGPT produces. But I'd like some of my writing to survive the Great Ingestion. Writing matters, how humans express themselves matters. In other words we still have work to do in search, AI does not fill that need, at least not yet.

Forget about juries of our peers. It raises so many questions. If a woman is about to miscarry are they even allowed to admit her to the hospital, or does she have to wait until she is actually dying? If you can check her in, what are the limits of the treatment they can provide? Aspirin? Blood? Oxygen? Surgery? And btw, medicine has advanced a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; since before Roe v Wade.

					<outline text="1. About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node made it click. It's server software, so there must be a way to write an HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has, but what I needed was a Hello World script. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt; gave me the script, and step by step &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to write it.

					<outline text="I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.  That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is, and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going. " created="Tue, 24 Sep 2024 17:00:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP server, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with a server that ran in &quot;Frontier&quot;.

					<outline text="2. Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was 1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use it, but I didn't know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense, because they talked about things I didn't understand. What I really needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how to use. I found one, a service provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html&quot;&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;. You emailed a message to them and they put it &quot;on the web&quot; and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and there's what you typed. I tried &lt;i&gt;Hello World&lt;/i&gt; and got back a link to a page that said Hello World.

I know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We're all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I hear there's some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don't care. I want my Hello World.

					<outline text="One thing I've learned is it can be hard to get the attention of the doctors. And once you see your GP about a problem it's almost certain they're going to send you to a specialist. So you go to the specialist and it's pretty random as to whether they put the effort into understanding your situation in full. And they aren't trying to solve all your problems, just the ones they deal in. " created="Sat, 21 Sep 2024 14:14:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="An aside, a couple of years ago I had a condition that ChatGPT diagnosed in a second but it took the doctors who weren't paying much attention (my primary care doctor had retired and I was being shuffled between NPs and MDs until they could find someone to be my new main doctor) so they were all sending me to the wrong specialists, all of whom said there was no problem, yet I still had the symptoms which were getting worse. On the fourth try, someone sent me to the right specialist and they instantly diagnosed what ChatGPT had diagnosed at the outset. So when people say AI could hurt medical care, I don't think so, it would probably be a good idea to have an AI looking over their shoulders and asking if they've considered the Occam's Razor specialist.

					<outline text="And communicating with the system is ridiculous. Almost everything has to be done over the phone. They have email, but if you want to set up an appointment, you have to call. And wait on hold. And wait and wait. And then it's a dice roll as to who you get connected to. There are some people you talk to who seem to be trying to be annoying.

					<outline text="So right now I have a thing that needs to be looked into because it might be one of those serious things.

The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this.

There was a consensus, it was a small community by then, very collegial. Dave Slusher had already used the term in his podcast (according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/history-of-word-podcast&quot;&gt;James Cridland&lt;/a&gt;), so I said in the Trade Secrets &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040923224915/http://secrets.scripting.com/2004/09/22#a26&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;, let's just go ahead and use it. I did mention Ben Hammersley. So he's not out of the story, but he's not the person who gave podcasting its name. September 2004 was the moment when podcasting became something. It's rare in things like this that you can point to a moment, but we can &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=podcast&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the record should make that very clear. You could say Hammersley was the first to publish the term in a piece he wrote, but he played no role in the bootstrap. I'd say that by the end of 2004 it was on its way, I basically stepped back and enjoyed the medium along with everyone else. Adam started a company. I would have liked to have started a company then, but it wasn't meant to be. That all happened 20 years ago.

				<outline text="In hindsight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; chose the wrong business model. They could have done what Automattic has done with WordPress. It's a private company so I don't know how much it's growing or how profitable it is, but from outside it's obviously growing and profitable. Basically, charge writers for the service, or lots of services. Little extras you can add to your site. Use it as a hook to sell domain names (huge recurring business). And open source the Medium editor, when it came out it was a breakthrough in usability, and offer it to Google to bundle with Chrome, upgrade the whole web while you're at it. With billions of windfall from the success of Twitter, why argue over nickels and dimes. That's what I always wondered about the thinking behind Medium. Ev had the ability to change the course of the industry, and make the same kind of money Google and Microsoft make. And yes, I did urge him to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium&quot;&gt;all this&lt;/a&gt; at the time, publicly (didn't have access to him privately, if you can believe that).

					<outline text="The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex. " created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:34:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break. " created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:34:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Neither one is in a particularly strong position. " created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:34:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do. " created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:48:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there. " created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:38:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like &quot;fediverse&quot; get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch). " created="Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:50:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working &lt;i&gt;together. &lt;/i&gt;It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies.

				<outline text="Paul Graham wrote a very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html&quot;&gt;useful piece&lt;/a&gt; about &quot;Founder Mode.&quot; As a founder myself, I think I can tell you why founders have a central role to play as the company grows. They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a &quot;market of one&quot; and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. :smile:" created="Sun, 01 Sep 2024 15:52:12 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/01/paulMcCartney.png"/>
				<outline text="Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it.

				<outline text="Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook&quot;&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. :smile:" created="Sun, 01 Sep 2024 16:45:43 GMT" type="outline"/>
