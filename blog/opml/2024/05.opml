Here's why I need it. I am building my blogroll. Every time I find an insightful story about using tech I use, these days esp AI, I add it to my blogroll so I get to see any new articles they write when they post. But if their blog has a catchy name, I'll never pick it out of the list as I scan for something new to read. I need the name of the author too. Basically a blogger should provide their name, but of course it's completely optional. I'll subscribe anyway, if the article is on-topic.

					<outline text="I remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kvell&quot;&gt;kvelling&lt;/a&gt; about Napster, about how the ability to program my own music had made it possible for me to explore my own life in new ways, because music is inexorably bound to memory. For me the big revelation came on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/06/18.html&quot;&gt;Father's Day in 2000&lt;/a&gt; when I heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk&quot;&gt;Father and Son&lt;/a&gt; by Cat Stevens on the radio and desperately wanted to hear it again. " created="Fri, 31 May 2024 12:35:14 GMT" urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk"/>
					<outline text="I had tried Napster a few months earlier and found that it had none of my music. It was basically just a technology demo. I tried it again, and this time not only did it have the Cat Stevens song, but it had every song from my childhood that I hadn't heard since being a kid listening to WABC on the transistor radio my grandfather gave me for my birthday when I was five or six years old." created="Fri, 31 May 2024 12:37:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I told this story at a Future of Music conference and was torn apart by the other people on stage, supposedly creative people, who cared not one bit about how people used the product they created, and the power of being able to program our own music. They were the bosses of music and my job was merely to give them money and admiration and stfu. They tried to get me off the stage (I was the moderator) but I stood my ground and of course never forgot."/>
					<outline text="It happened again a few years later at the DNC in Boston, when the journalists mocked the bloggers because we had no experience as journalists, and they didn't like the way we dressed (they wrote articles about it, in the NYT even). 20+ years later they're still complaining, but they forget to blame us for their misery, now. Their misery is they forget the glory of their job, which is empowering us -- their users -- to change the world that so desperately needs changing. "/>
					<outline text="It's happening again with AI, which is opening up creative expression to people who can't draw, or aren't good writers, or people who want to be better programmers, or who knows -- this technology is the most powerful I've used in my long life in tech. "/>
					<outline text="The difference is -- you have to use something before your criticism makes any sense. That was the mistake the music industry made with Napster. What the journalists made regarding bloggers (we're they're sources, tried to say over and over but they don't listen they just like to talk and be admired and our job as usual is to give them money and stfu). "/>
					<outline text="My very good friend Doc Searls sees it the same way. He calls it &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/28/the-peoples-ai/&quot;&gt;People's AI&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="(Sidebar: The people who run tech companies today have no idea how to build new technology markets, the categories they occupy were built by others, now gone. I finally figured that's our disconnect and why products lose important features when they are taken over by the inheritors, and why the leaders of Google et al have no idea where to put AI for users to build with it, or even that the users build the stuff they use in tech. Say what you want about Jack, Ev and Biz, but they understood this idea and they did let the users lead.)" created="Fri, 31 May 2024 12:40:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And btw, don't miss that it was twelve of us, twelve people, that finally said what the ladder-occupiers have failed to say for far too long about Trump -- he's a felon. We've known that, but when did Obama, Biden, Moscow Mitch or anyone else with a name or reputation to protect say the most obvious truth. They're all powerless and weak, and if we want to get out of this mess we're going to have to lead ourselves. Waiting for them, that didn't work. "/>

Adam being the user, and I being the developer. Of course it was his trying to be a developer, and me trying to be a user that was the spark that created the boom. We both made it safe for amateurs to do what we do. That's why podcasting, unlike the music industry, never went to war with its users.  :boom:" created="Fri, 31 May 2024 12:53:08 GMT"/>

Every day I'm trying to do it myself and encourage others to as well. Explain things we can do now that weren't approachable before. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/25/howIUsedChatGptThisMorning.m4a&quot;&gt;15 minute report&lt;/a&gt; about this just now. I had to debug a complicated new configuration, setting up a new server with new code on both ends to implement a secure websocket connection. I've done it a dozen times, and you always make at least one mistake, and have to find it, and you need a checklist to go through, systematically, to find the problem, and it's really cool that ChatGPT can synthesize the checklist and give you instructions on tools that make it easy. There could never be anything like this on a Google/Stack Exchange type support system. It simply wasn't possible a year ago. We really need this story to get out too, but now it's all about how AI is a hoax. It is not. Yes Silicon Valley is run by monsters, doing basically the best they can. Riding a wave like this is thrilling but also you can't win on a personal level these days. It used to be the other way, you couldn't lose.

				<outline text="No one was asking for the PCs, GUIs, the web, blogging or podcasting. I thought for sure as soon as the ideas were out they'd take off. But most people had no idea. Most big new ideas come out of developers realizing something new is possible, shipping it, refining it and getting lucky. AI is the next one, I'm absolutely sure of it. But most people, even most developers, don't see the need, don't see it as inevitable in a good way. To make a fine point, we don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; AI, we didn't need PCs or GUIs or the web. But once the masses saw the power, fun and utility, there was no turning back. The same is true of AI. I've been trying to puzzle out how this will go. How can we develop the amazing power and depth of knowledge of the machine combined with the creativity and deep yearning of humans. One thing I've learned from the year I've been doing this as a user, the machine doesn't want to do anything. Don't anthropomorphize it that way. Try having a conversation with it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/cb9c4c97-bb20-439e-a503-ed2356403b0c&quot;&gt;ask what it wants&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't understand the concept. It's not surprising that we think the machine will be like us, we always want something, we're the most selfish species there is. But we'll learn to work with the machine, I already have. We'll &lt;i&gt;evolve&lt;/i&gt; through this. That's maybe the biggest strength our species has, the rate at which we can adapt." created="Thu, 23 May 2024 19:58:31 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/24/santaSecure.png"/>

I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is.

You can't snap your fingers and have a good new UI for every one of their products, ready in a year, although they will try as MS tried to adapt Office to the web. They don't have the right people or corporate culture to do that. Instead you have to hope you can find a great bootstrapping startup outside to work with, and use their strength as a distributor to help them.

I'm discovering new significance for it every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be simple from the user's point of view, and in order for it to work technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It's a tall order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I'm confident I've covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press release? If you want to understand a new technology, don't talk to the CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are whirlwinds, they don't have time or the capacity to understand how big the idea is, they just know that it is big.

				<outline text="I've been trying the new 4o version of ChatGPT. It's much faster. It certainly is a search engine. And it covers news. I asked it about Michael Cohen's testimony today in the Trump trial, and it gave me a summary. I asked for the weather forecast in Kingston NY. It wouldn't give me the lyrics to Martha My Dear by the Beatles. I asked it to draw a weather map of the mid-Atlantic states, but it drew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/05/13/205122.html&quot;&gt;usual garbage&lt;/a&gt; for technical images.

Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.

					<outline text="Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, &quot;they don't really mean it.&quot; This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage&quot;&gt;umbrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt; of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a &quot;standard&quot; and thus was born Atom. My opinion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;one way is better&lt;/a&gt; than two, and they should have jumped on the &quot;RSS&quot; bandwagon.

So now I have gone back through his music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others, and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980).

				<outline text="If you're a blogger, here's something to think about. Whose writing influenced the way you write? Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker&quot;&gt;Russell Baker&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland&quot;&gt;Douglas Coupland&lt;/a&gt; (specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;MicroSerfs&lt;/a&gt;), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software." created="Wed, 01 May 2024 13:00:58 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="My father taught me how to organize my thinking when I was trying to figure out how something works. And that's basically what I've spent my life on, figuring out how things work. The most interesting and gratifying was understanding things that didn't exist until I pieced their story together. " created="Wed, 01 May 2024 14:31:01 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I have to admit I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=tyrese+maxey&quot;&gt;Tyrese Maxey&lt;/a&gt; of the Sixers, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40061591/amazing-maxey-late-burst-helps-76ers-stay-alive-ot-win-knicks&quot;&gt;spoiled a Knicks victory&lt;/a&gt; last night that would have closed out the first round of the playoffs. It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;local TV&lt;/a&gt; with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier&quot;&gt;Walt Clyde Frazier&lt;/a&gt;. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms&quot;&gt;narration&lt;/a&gt; is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/&quot;&gt;Archie Bunker&lt;/a&gt;. I keep wanting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I do not think it means what you think it means,&quot; but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=nba+schedule&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;&quot;&gt;next game&lt;/a&gt;. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?" created="Wed, 01 May 2024 12:28:11 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/waltFrazier.png"/>
				<outline text="When I log on to meta.ai, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/01/suggestions.png&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; are the suggestions. None of them relate to things I'm thinking about. I haven't been a student or interviewed for a job in decades. But I've been on Facebook for many years, and I had to connect this to my Facebook account to use it, so presumably it knows all that Facebook knows about me, about me.
