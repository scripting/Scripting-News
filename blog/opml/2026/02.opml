I tell my perspective of MeToo, and how that imho created enough anti-Dem energy to push Trump over the top. Polls won't tell you how the Dems got the rep of being the party run by women to cancel men, but I'm sure if we could cure that somehow, we could do everything we need to do to get American democracy working again. I did this in response to a Frum podcast where he and his guest conclude that the young folks are making a big mistake, they don't want the same old bullshit people coming back into power. Frum and Miller thought that the young men don't want was democracy, foolishly (I would agree) but there is real anger there, I know about it because I have it too. I still vote for Dems, but I also fear what happens if we snap back to the political correctness of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand&quot;&gt;Kirsten Gillibrand&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sat, 28 Feb 2026 14:23:02 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/02/16/gaslight.png"/>

They are so weary of the Islamic Revolution, they say and are right that Iran could be top 10 country, economically, except their government thinks this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages&quot;&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. They want to live in modernity, and they're probably the only ones who think a war with the US is a good idea. Because living in an autorcacy is unthinkable for Americans. We don't really appreciate what we're becoming. If we did, we still could do something about it.

				<outline text="One of the items in &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for Standards-makers&lt;/a&gt; is don't design the format before you make the app. Instead, make an app, and when you're ready, make the file format public so people can interop (ie compete) so as not to lock users to in your software. If you do that you can say you are &quot;of the web.&quot; If we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; do that always, voila! -- no more silos. Another rule is that you must use an existing format if it exists, because then you will interop with apps that support that format. Gratuitous incompatibility is a sign of a silo-seeker. So, look first, if there are no usable formats, make your app and make your format public.

We'll be testing it soon on my blog, and then everyone's. This should be the grand slam home run of my career. That's how it feels to me now.

The management also had a strike paper, also a website, and we worked with them, because I guess our actual mission was to figure out how to get the news on the web.

					<outline text="I keep coming back to this, I'd like to use an AI-managed Wikipedia. Its human-edited system was an innovation in the early days of the web, but it has serious flaws that can now be addressed with AI. Keep a set of pages current with the best information available over time that tell a true story, not serve as a PR agency for people who pay for the story they want told. That is a problem the AI services can solve today, and I would have a lot more confidence in the accuracy of what we get. " created="Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:24:36 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="A great example is RSS. Wikipedia thinks it's about a format. I think the story is news. How RSS became a standard in the news world and the blogging world at the same time. That turned out to be significant. We, the people who want news, were gifted a great start, thanks to the creativity and generosity of the NY TImes who helped get the ball rolling in the news industry. Last time I checked they weren't even mentioned in the Wikipedia story. " created="Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:47:33 GMT"/>

Thank you. I don't read most of the pieces that come in via RSS. I scroll through the updates, and if something catches my eye, I stop, read the first part, and then if my interest continues, I read the rest. That's the way I've always read news, going back to the kitchen table at my childhood home where we subscribed to the NY Times, print edition (this was long before the web) and we all sat around the table in the morning reading it and telling each other what we found. News isn't like email. But FeedLand does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.com/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ffeed%2Fall%2F&quot;&gt;mailbox reader&lt;/a&gt;, patterned after Brent's NetNewsWire (only steal from the best). There are times when that's what you want. And mostly I wanted to thank Brent for the mention. BTW, that's not the only new idea in FeedLand. Let's get to know each others' products. That's one of the mistakes we made last time -- thinking each of our products was a self-contained universe. We are part of a community that grew from the web. So by definition we are all just part of a very big world. All our products work together, and to preserve that we as people must all &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt; too.

Then I realized since all this stuff is on GitHub, people could help with this, by instead of sending me the report, post a note on GitHub, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/350&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; -- saying you searched for this term and this is what I saw. Provide the term and a screen shot of what you saw. And then other people who have some extra time, could look through the archive, find the post, and then show me what needs to be fixed. I would then fix it, and over time the archive would get fixed. I posted a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/350&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the Scripting News repo, if you want to help, bookmark that link, and when you see an error, post the note and we can get going.

						<outline text="Back in 1999, Kleiner Perkins’ John Doerr commented: “Believe it or not, the Internet is actually underhyped.” He called it “the largest legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet.” He was so on the money.

					<outline text="So if the internet is not the greatest invention, what is? I haven't spent much time thinking about this, but my initial choice is AI. Because it's so hugely powerful and yet almost entirely undefined. Uncharted territory, which is all human knowledge. It might be the invention whose product is invention.

Or perhaps Visicalc. People would likely say the iPhone, but I still want something in that form factor that I can write software for and share with others without having to go through a company like Apple. So in that sense the iPhone might have been a negative invention, it cut off possibilities for an amateur development community to develop, as it did on the Apple II, Mac, PC, etc.  " created="Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:37:42 GMT"/>

And as he's doing that, I'm slogging away the same way I've always done it, working on the top level user interface of WordLand in browser-based JavaScript. I don't see a way around it, because I have a special way of working on user interfaces, and we're still quite a ways away from the bot being able to do vibe coding at that level. It's fascinating to watch Jake revive code I wrote in the late 80s and early 90s. He's a very accomplished user of it, being transformed, with the help of the bots, into a kernel-level developer of what's basically an OS built around a scripting language, object database and with the internet latched on after the whole thing was done, and then ported to Windows. I stopped working at that level before all that michegas happened. I have looked at the code Jake is working on to see what became of it, and wasn't horrified, I recognized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/snippets/nerdsguide.html&quot;&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt;, but I wouldn't ever want to work on that myself. I imagine some commercial developers have already rebuilt their testing and support functions for products around ChatGPT-like systems. If you're an &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontiernews.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;old Frontier fanatic&lt;/a&gt;, that's where our product is once again getting out in front.

In JavaScript what's the best way to defer the call to Boo so that the two instances are unrelated, and the first instance goes away.&quot; I was pretty sure as I wrote this that setTimeout was the answer, but ChatGPT offered it as the first choice, and explained why it was the best.

After we get that going, of course I want to work with other blogging systems to make sure their products can be used in the same way.

I've seen it said elsewhere, that RSS and ChatGPT are particularly well-suited for each other. I don't understand the connection, other than RSS is always useful, as a way of formalizing the output of an app so other apps can use it as input. Another thing AI apps have in common with &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/02/03/systemVerbsApps.png&quot;&gt;done&lt;/a&gt; in the past is the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter05.html&quot;&gt;script apps&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of the big features of Frontier esp on the Mac starting in the early 90s. This started out just for desktop apps but worked just as well for web apps, once that opportunity became available. I felt strongly that the Mac with it's very functional GUI could benefit from a powerful system-level scripting language with the UI objects being scriptable, and the data of the apps accessible via script. That kind of duality is still a common theme in computer work, I'm doing the same kind of thing with WordPress, as the OS for the web, and making it possible to create different UIs in ways that earlier social web apps can't.

There is so much really good tech that ends up lost to history because people wouldn't open their eyes and see that they weren't alone. That might be the biggest flaw in the design of our species, that it's so rare that we get together on the way things should work. Other examples -- MP3, QuickDraw, HTML.
