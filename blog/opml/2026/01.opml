				<outline text="Next year I have to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2026/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;. This year's conference is going on right now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels&quot;&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. If you're there and reading this -- say a hello for me. I realize the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2026/01/30/150403.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote yesterday about the future of the social web is equally relevant now for FOSDEM. My prescription: carefully &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2026/01/30/150403.html#a150735&quot;&gt;start over&lt;/a&gt; with a simple peer-to-peer service and build on that foundation. I would use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket&quot;&gt;websockets&lt;/a&gt;. You will have to deal with issues of centralization, and at each point decide how much you're willing to trade off ease of use and performance for decentralization. I think you can go pretty far without stripping the gears of users, but there has to be some amount of centralization, identity and storage, being the two biggies. Please read the piece, it's short, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2026/01/30/150403.html&quot;&gt;bulleted style&lt;/a&gt;, highly opinionated, and based on my experience with systems like the ones they're working on. (Who does he think he is? Just a software developer, working hard for a feature-complete web who thinks we've been stuck in a few ruts for a depressingly long time.)

				<outline text="I've learned a new self-management strategy. At the beginning of a day's programming work I set a specific goal that I feel I should be able to accomplish very quickly, in an hour, perhaps -- but probably less. If I get it done by the end of the day I will feel like I really got something done. The feeling it can be done quickly has to do with a lot of factors that you don't take into account so that in your mind it's simple but as you implement it you hit deal-stoppers. It makes you feel bad, if you're into being productive and brilliant as I am. But I know from experience that solving &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; problem in a day, at the end of the day, is a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; feeling. There have been a lot of days when I don't move the needle even the smallest distance, and a fair number of days when I reject what I've been building, and basically move backward by days.

Thankfully they haven't completely broken HTTP yet. I like to think they can't because so much of the web would break if they did. People might not notice the &lt;i&gt;Not Secure&lt;/i&gt; message they post in Chrome for sites that use HTTP (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; for example) -- but they would notice sites disappearing. There are so many reasons not to deprecate HTTP but the most important, no one owns it -- which is why the web is such a safe place to build. Google does not have the right to break the web. But they figure no one will object because users don't care about the web. But they do, they just don't understand that their online freedom comes from the web, like our freedom in America comes from the Constitution. Once it's gone (something we're finding out about now) we'll know why we should have cared. I've been appealing to historians to care about the history of technology, but they don't listen. Somehow they must think that tech will always remain exactly as useful as it is now. That it has never been free of platforms (it has) and the platform vendors will never cross the lines they imagine but don't actually exist? Well they can and they do, but since the historians don't study the history of tech, they don't know about it, and they don't listen to those who do. We have to build our own systems, our own news flows because the ones we depend on are owned by people who are not our friends, are not trustworthy." created="Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:15:30 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2026/01/29/notSecure.png"/>

AI is going to be part of programming forever. There's no way to go back. This has made StackExchange obsolete, because it basically aggregates everything that was there, and it was worth it because you can find things you never could find before, and it takes no time to search because it isn't really searching, it's gathered the knowledge and gives it back to you exactly as you asked for it. And when I write a piece of software using ChatGPT it presumably learns everything I learned, so it gets better and better, just like StackExchange used to, but (and here's the punchline) the knowledge is owned by a few companies, with no obligation to share what they learned. Very different from the old method, though I'm sure StackExchange wasn't obligated to share everything, the users would have found out immediately and they would have quick competition that were so obligated. (So StackExchange would change.) We get so mired in the question of should we do this -- well we're doing it, time to start looking at the next set of questions.

First, I've done &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; than kick around with ATP for the few years, I have written apps, some of which &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dave.linkblog.org&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/art.feediverse.org&quot;&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt;.

If they want to shut you down, you will be shut down. They have all the power. And as long as they don't support the data format you use because of its severe limitations, you won't be able to publish on Bluesky. Imho you have no advantage using it over the web, which already does &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;everything you need&lt;/a&gt; to do your own Bluesky, with none of the missing features.

Specifically the scene where Churchill is surprised by a visit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.royal.uk/george-vi&quot;&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;, who we learned earlier is pissed off, while Churchill is morose and undecided on what to do. The King wants Churchill to know that he wants to fight, and that the people will be with him if he tells them what's really going on. I asked ChatGPT to summarize this scene in one good-size paragraph. " created="Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:21:09 GMT">

The King’s visit reframes Churchill’s dilemma: leadership is not about finding a clever compromise but about trusting the public with the truth and giving them something worth enduring hardship for. The moment restores Churchill’s resolve, confirming that he is not alone and that moral clarity, not political maneuvering, is what the country needs from him." created="Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:45:05 GMT"/>

Yes, I really liked working with the Microsoft people, and I would have worked with them no matter where they came from. But it really helped build my confidence to know it came from inside the biggest most dominant tech company at the time. What an odd combination. Just like going to Harvard was political.

I've also been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/leaflet.pub/post/3md4qsqncqs24&quot;&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt;, an attractive writing tool that works on AT Proto, the format that Bluesky is promoting, basically a reinvention of the web but inside a silo, which means -- perhaps confusingly, that Leaflet uses the same basic format that Bluesky uses, but Bluesky can't do anything with Leaflet posts, because of the limits that Leaflet doesn't have. So -- they formed an alliance with two other products that are writing tools for AT Proto, and came up with a format that they will all implement called &lt;a href=&quot;https://standard.site/&quot;&gt;standard.site&lt;/a&gt; (nice name and very attractive site). They probably hope that Bluesky itself will use that format, at least to let people read their documents in the same place they display the more limited Bluesky posts, in user timelines. If that happens it may be a good thing for the web, if services outside of Bluesky can post these documents from outside. But it would be imho more powerful if they created a format based on something like RSS, which is already well-known to developers, and would mean something outside of Bluesky and probably would be taken more seriously by the Bluesky people.

I call the ones that are left out the WordPress.org sites, though I know that's not an entirely accurate way of describing it, but neither is &quot;self-hosted sites&quot; because you could have a hosting service that doesn't install Jetpack.

I want, before I hang up my hat, to fix that. " created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:27:46 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I'm going to outline here how we start, so it's documented so more people will see it too. " created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:27:11 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true">
						<outline text="I have written a package, MIT-licensed, with an awkward name for historic reasons called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;wpIdentity&lt;/a&gt;. It started off as just a simple way to use WordPress identity with FeedLand because it made sense to do it a couple of years ago because Twitter was destroying the utility of their API, and we needed a new way to do identity. So I stopped everything and implemented both email identity and WordPress identity, or more specifically, wordpress.com identity. This leaves out all the wordpress sites that you can't log onto this way. Not a good situation, I don't like it because I want WordPress to be one large happy family of users and developers. So that's what I'm seeking to instigate here. " created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:05:24 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Then wpIdentity grew and grew. At first it supported all the endpoints in the wpcom API, and made it possible to build WordLand, which itself &lt;i&gt;only communicates to WordPress via wpIdentity.&lt;/i&gt;  And later when I needed user-specific storage that is not part of the WordPress API, I built a very nice little storage system, it's efficient, highly scalable, and (I think) well debugged. If you read my initial &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html&quot;&gt;Think Different&lt;/a&gt; piece you'll see it gets a mention in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a141421&quot;&gt;this part&lt;/a&gt;. Storage, we will find out, is the big missing piece in the web, has always been the missing piece, the thing that keeps us from having a real developer community of web apps. How do I know? Because I'm a freaking developer. I don't work at a company that can insulate me from this need. That's why I see this need and so many others don't." created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:08:14 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Now here's something else that's cool. I didn't stop with wpIdentity, I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;JavaScript function&lt;/a&gt; that simplifies the wpcom interface for people writing browser-based JavaScript apps. It radically simplifies it. I didn't invent this way of doing it, someone at Facebook did, as far as I'm concerned. We may not like Facebook the company or the boss man, but they have employed some brilliant programmers over the years. I think this idea came from the developers of FriendFeed, but I could be wrong. What they did was take the interface code every app developer has to do, and made &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; the API. I remember when I first saw it in 2013, it blew me away. It took me a full month to build support for Twitter in my app, but it only two days to do it in Facebook. I did one of those for WordPress. It's part of wpIdentity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;. Please if you're a contributor to wordpress.org -- study that thing, because we're going to be working on that code -- together. This is where the &quot;we&quot; part of it starts. But there's more." created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:12:08 GMT"/>
						<outline text="You don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to read the code of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js&quot;&gt;api2.js&lt;/a&gt; to understand how it works, there's an even easier way to do it -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo&quot;&gt;wpEditorDemo&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple browser-based editor that does what WordLand does, without all the flourish. Bare bones. Also MIT-licensed. Nothing but what's required. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpEditorDemo?tab=readme-ov-file#demo&quot;&gt;try it out&lt;/a&gt; if you have one or more qualifying sites (either on wordpress.com or having Jetpack installed). The project we need to do is this -- &lt;i&gt;make wpEditDemo work on any WordPress site, no matter where it's hosted.&lt;/i&gt;  And that's going to be done by extending api2.js. That's where the differences will be encapsulated, and above that level, in wpEditDemo and WordLand and all its competitors, nothing changes. This project may be complicated or simple, or somewhere inbetween, but imho this has to be done. And this is the first place I want to join the open source community for WordPress. After talking with Jon, I became optimistic about this happening sooner than later. " created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:17:19 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I zoomed through all this and more with Jonathan on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2026/01/13.html#a224042&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. This is what I want to talk about at WordCamp Europe later this year (I have submitted an application). I wanted to show Jon and a few other people I met in Ottawa in October how the pieces fit together. But zooming is the right word, Jon was ahead of me at every step, he just understood what I was showing him. I was blown away -- because this had never happened before with the architecture I had built. Not because it's so complex, it isn't -- it's all about simplifying things, with lots of factoring, finding a repeating pattern and then locking it down in code, so no one has to ever worry about the complexity again. I think it was hard for people to see because they aren't expecting it. " created="Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:17:35 GMT"/>

It started off with a simple story about how I knew I was on the right track when &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/tumblr-to-move-its-half-a-billion-blogs-to-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Matt announced&lt;/a&gt; they were porting Tumblr to run on top of WordPress as an OS. Which is exactly what I'm doing with my collection of software. Every bit of writing should be a WordPress post, and they should be linked together in arbitrary graphs. It was nice to review that with a serious developer, Jonathan is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/11/26/core-committers-check-in-november-2025/&quot;&gt;core committers&lt;/a&gt; of the open source WordPress. It helped me see all the different things we can do, and now hope we will do. I feel I understand this community, as a time-traveler from the past I think I understand what we should do next.

						<outline text="Susan Kare’s work on the original Macintosh wasn’t just visually elegant, it was foundational: she showed that icons could be humane, legible, and generous to the user. The mailbox-flag affordance in the Alarm Desk Accessory is a perfect example—simple, memorable, and instantly understandable, yet rich with meaning. It wasn’t decorative; it taught the interface how to communicate. That clarity came from Kare’s rare combination of artistic intuition and respect for the people using the machine. Just as important was her personal generosity: again and again, she contributed work freely, trusting that good ideas grow stronger when shared. Many of us benefited directly from that spirit, receiving world-class design not as a transaction, but as a gift." created="Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:28:45 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Carrying these designs forward—faithfully, with credit—is one way creativity survives across generations. Reusing an icon like the mailbox flag isn’t nostalgia; it’s continuity. It acknowledges that great interface ideas don’t expire, and that today’s software is part of a long conversation rather than a clean break from the past. By preserving the pixel logic, the affordance, and the attribution to Susan Kare, we honor both the craft and the culture that produced it. That’s how design knowledge persists: not by constant reinvention, but by respectful reuse, gratitude, and the quiet understanding that we’re building on work someone once chose to share."/>

On my drive to town yesterday I went through the small town of Woodstock, and I was thinking about how ICE is occupying Minneapolis, and wondered why wasn't I more concerned about it personally. The answer -- it's far away from here, and Woodstock, while it is a famous place, is on absolutely no one's radar. But then I remembered the astounding amount of money we allocated for ICE, far more than could be used for border enforcement, so obviously this all is a prelude for an American secret police and here's where the disquieting idea came up. Of course ICE will operate in every city and town in the US no matter how remote or small.

The answer is -- &lt;i&gt;don't conform.&lt;/i&gt; It isn't up to any single contributor to turn the tide, instead their only job is to be true to themselves, and learn from others and share what they've learned. Be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;human-size&lt;/a&gt; blogger. I thought perhaps this represented my opportunity to speak to them, and help understand that there are tech people who want to work with them and enhance their freedom, rather than consume it. But we need &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; help to do it. They've settled on Substack, without realizing they're just hooking up with the same people who screwed them before (ie Twitter, then all the techies who have dinner with Trump). As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/einstein-insanity-quote/&quot;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; say -- doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome is not particularly smart, and Frum &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; smart. I don't care if he roots for the Red Sox (I'm a Mets fan), right now we're on the same side. We love the United States, and what it has done for us, and for the world, and we are falling apart. It's not time to stay within our communities, it's time to do whatever we can to save the country we love so much, &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22working%20together%22&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of us don't have the skill yet still would like to illustrate our ideas with images and videos. For those of us, the AI apps are a godsend. They're also pretty good I hear at providing medical advice. I've been using it for that pretty extensively. At my age health is not something you can ignore, and it helps to be informed. And with the healthcare system these days in the US being so limited, you don't really get to have a relationship with your doctor as we did in the past, so guess what, I bet ChatGPT is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/16/well/ai-chatbot-doctors-health-care-advice.html&quot;&gt;saving some lives&lt;/a&gt;. So if you don't like being seriously wrong about new tech, you should start seeing the advantages, not just the belief that it cancels freedom.
