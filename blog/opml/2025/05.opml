				<outline text="Why does Apple invent their own proprietary plugs when everyone else does USB? Even if you don't like to speak ill of Apple, you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; why they do it. They want to control who can make add-ons to their products in hardware, just as they do in software. I still buy their products, but I also buy products that use standards, so I can use them on lots of devices. Now, the same thing happens in software from other people and companies. They can choose to use what already exists, or invent their own. Example, I chose MP3 for podcasting, did not invent a new format. If I were to do a social web network, I would use RSS, I wouldn't invent a new format. I want interop. I want to create an open platform, I don't mind making money, but that's not why I do it.

If he does his job, the pundits and fans say he's slumping (low points). But he's just doing his job. Same thing, flipped around -- when they say Brunson is scoring so many points, he's doing great, like LeBron or Kobe, but actually it's a sign the team is fucked up. Too dependent on one offensive player, the others are just standing around in case he wants to pass it to them. I exaggerate, but it does work out that way. What you want is a team where there are always lots of options, and to the extent that they're hot, the team is impossible to defend. But a Brunson holding the ball all the time makes it easier to beat the Knicks? That was (as I've said a few times) the problem with Melo. Now we've &lt;i&gt;seen&lt;/i&gt; the non-Brunsons on the Knicks kick ass. If the Knicks don't make it past this round, and it is it seems pretty likely -- next season they should focus on configurations that have to sink or swim based on whether they can win without Brunson. Then, next year, we'll have something, perhaps. But I'm just a fan, seriously, no sarcasm. Same way I'm a fan of AI, I have no idea how it works, and I'm happy with that. And don't tell me it's like auto-complete, try using it for a while for real stuff, and tell me how you know that from using it. You don't. Each system has quirks that you have to learn the same way you have to learn the quirks of team members, and help them do stuff they're good at, so they can handle the ball and take shots without you getting involved. That's how you start to get teamwork. See how that works kind of like basketball? :-)" created="Wed, 28 May 2025 15:44:41 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png"/>
				<outline text="And btw, that's why I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/05/21.html#a135615&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; Chris Lydon to do interviews with people in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;audience&lt;/a&gt; who are tripping out on all the new power they're getting from AI. How is it augmenting their work? I know Chris well enough that he probably thinks it's not for him, too technical -- but that's the point -- the excitement with AI is not technical. That's the story all the other reporters are missing. It's the light in the users' eyes when they struggle to make you understand why it's the most incredible thing ever and they're so glad to have lived to see this. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; the freaking story. Help them get the ideas through. BTW, we have no idea how AI will rock our boat, we never did for other similar inventions. Who knew what the Beatles would lead to when they &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1964_North_American_tour&quot;&gt;came to America&lt;/a&gt;. They said (the Beatles did, with ridiculous humility) that they expected their fame will last a few years at most. PCs a few years later were supposed to be for the kitchen. Apple actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/28/appleKitchenComputer.png&quot;&gt;ran ads&lt;/a&gt; saying that in the late 70s. And the web? Well Chris was around near the beginning of that and knows how our eyes glazed over at the utopia we were envisioning, and we know, to some extent how all that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#First_presidency_(2017%E2%80%932021)&quot;&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;. The AI story is a great one, and as Chris had very little understanding of blogs when he did the series of podcasts in 2003 and 2004 that should win the Pulitzer Prize for being so presicent and courageous, he's the right guy to get this story, if he has the patience and stamina. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/05/22/214121.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;. Sure you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to cover Harvard v Trump but AI is a story of love from the users and that story hasn't been told yet, and it's a big one, like what were the Beatles for and why, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1964_North_American_tour&quot;&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt;.

Halliburton, if they should happen to win another game this year, should learn that either of the first two games in the series could easily have gone the other way. And so should the freaking pundits, when they focus on how great the Pacers were and how pitiful the Knicks are. The Pacers won the first game by three points, and the second one by five. And the Knicks won the third game by six. Could have gone the other way too. And the Knicks are fucking great at overcoming 20-point deficits. The absolute best in the NBA.

				<outline text="The Knicks got beat last night. And the game seemed so won. When Brunson sat down in the fourth period because he was in foul trouble, the Knicks had a huge run that put them up by 17 with less than 3 minutes remaining. My numbers might be slightly off. Then they brought Brunson back, and it all flipped around. The Pacers were getting off shots where they weren't before, and their aim was deadly. So it wasn't just the Knicks folding, the Pacers were hot. The announcers were so clueless, the Knicks didn't need Brunson back. He was benched a good portion of the final blowout with Boston. I loved that. Showed he can sit down when needed, and the team will keep going. When he was injured in March, the Knicks faltered at first, but then they learned how to put it together with the remaining players which believe it or not are a full NBA team, a very competitive one. So when Brunson gets in foul trouble and the remaining Knicks are in a groove don't screw with it. That should be the lesson of last night's game. The Knicks were very good, net-net, but the Pacers were better and they won. " created="Thu, 22 May 2025 15:51:03 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png"/>

We need someone to do a canvas of how intellectuals use ChatGPT-like systems to advance their research and creativity, or just for learning or fun. It's the same kind of opportunity that was in front of us in 2003 when blogs were new, and only a few people loved the idea, but they were fierce in their enthusiasm. You could tell something was happening. It happened before that with PCs, and now it's happening again with AI. I'm absolutely sure of this, as sure as I was with PCs and the web. So Chris, humor me -- this is your new assignment -- find out from the people who listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; not what's bad about AI, they hear that all the time, let's hear their stories, why they think it's the best thing ever. I believe you'll find them. That's what's missing today in journalism, and it's something Chris is uniquely able to do.

The clarity is remarkable, and he's of course right. The people running the validator were actually promoting Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal was &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open web. When you keep changing your mind about what to flag and what to pass you end up with a standard that's as murky as the tariff policy of the US in 2025. I think you have to assume that was the goal.

I've pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me think I must be dreaming. &lt;i&gt;NYK leads 3-1.&lt;/i&gt; Yesterday at this time (5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and the beginning of last night's game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks couldn't seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It's primitive, but it's real. However! In the second half it turned around. The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by &lt;i&gt;being better&lt;/i&gt; than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must've relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we're up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one, it's over. No I didn't think we'd be here tonight. Remember that when you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as unbelievable as that might be." created="Tue, 13 May 2025 21:33:17 GMT" type="outline" imagex="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/30/spikeLeeKnicksFan.png" imagey="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/13/knickGameCard.png"/>

I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful.

					<outline text="Three questions came up in overnight posts re &quot;WordLand&quot;." created="Tue, 06 May 2025 12:50:10 GMT" flNumberedSubs="true">
						<outline text="Where did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/83&quot;&gt;Bookmarks menu&lt;/a&gt; go? It's mentioned in the docs under &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/wordland/#1732286073000&quot;&gt;Feature List&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature doesn't appear to be in the product. It is there, you just have to go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/06/settings.png&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/a&gt; page to turn it on. It's in the menu at the right edge of the screen. I'm doing some work on it, simplifying it, and finding and fixing a bug. It's going to be in the final 1.0 release of WordLand. " created="Tue, 06 May 2025 12:50:24 GMT"/>
						<outline text="How do I know when an post has been published? It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/57#issuecomment-2853465283&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; we post a dialog that confirms that a post is published. People found it confusing since it appears as if it works like a social media post editor, as in Twitter or Mastodon, it behaves like a blog post editor. This is a good and valid point and something that had not occurred to me! I've been advertising it as inspired by the tiny little textbox editors, but it doesn't behave like one, because you can edit a post after it has been published and it is expected that the user knows this, and they don't always get it. I will work on this. " created="Tue, 06 May 2025 12:51:57 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The user might not have a WordPress site. They may have created an account to just log onto WordLand, but didn't know they needed to also create a site to work with. The software does not behave well in this circumstance. Again, something that did not occur to me, because I think of the WordPress world as huge, and that my new, tiny and humble product couldn't be creating new users for them, but it does. So there will have to at least be docs for how to do this. Not sure if there's an API for creating a new site, I imagine that there is not such a thing, but will look into it.

				<outline text="I think we're at the &quot;no more new features&quot; point of the first release of &quot;WordLand&quot;. Learned my lesson on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/82&quot;&gt;0.5.7 release&lt;/a&gt;. There comes a point in a developing product that it may not be perfect for every possible user, and while it has bugs (all software does), it is useful for what it was designed to do. In the case of WordLand, there's nothing else like it out there, and it forms a foundation to build on, not just for itself but for other types of editors, all pumping people's writing out through WordPress. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt; with a sweet new UI. Thousands of developers work in WordPress. Maybe tens of thousands. That's what I get excited about. WordLand is the equivalent of the twitter-like &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22tiny%20little%20textbox%22&quot;&gt;tiny little textbox&lt;/a&gt;, but it grows big as your writing does, and it has the features Twitter removed. Anyway I don't expect to do any further adventures in features for WordLand for a while, instead I'm going to assume it's there and build connections to other software, my own and that of friends, in this context products that use open formats like &quot;RSS&quot; and &quot;OPML&quot; for interop. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; too.

				<outline text="ChatGPT is great for finding information on the public web, but I can't figure out how to find stuff I've worked on with ChatGPT in ChatGPT. There are big usability issues. I think it's getting better in some ways, but it's leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took notes outside of ChatGPT. There's another problem, if I want to use my own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out, because I don't charge people to use my software, at least not so far, and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem with Amazon and storage, why won't they sell storage to the user that they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must be a legal reason here, ie who's responsible for the content being stored.

				<outline text="If you get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;, the text might be a bit more readable. I've increased the font-size from 17px to 18px. I've only been able to do this lately because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email client.

				<outline text="Today I spent (or wasted) hours trying to get my WebSockets code working properly with &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Caddy&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;. Hours with ChatGPT, realizing it has a long way to go before it can manage code like I can. It gets fixated on an approach and never takes a step back to think maybe we're going about this the wrong way. It's extremely annoying all the times it tries to take you off track, and it works, it does take you down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole&quot;&gt;rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt; and then you realize it's only getting worse. The key is to not let it do that, but it's hard not to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism&quot;&gt;anthropomorphize&lt;/a&gt; so you don't want to hurt its feelings. In order to not be murdered as a small child you have to learn manners. And the bots push that too far. Really do take advantage. Still it knows far more than I do about everything, so if I could only get it to just shut the f up already and let me think! For something so capable it really doesn't spend enough time thinking, it's fully preoccupied with &lt;i&gt;doing.&lt;/i&gt; " created="Sat, 03 May 2025 17:11:10 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/03/rabbit.png"/>
				<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons&quot;&gt;Detroit Psssstons&lt;/a&gt; were truly great in the first round of the playoffs. And I was really gratified, ecstatic even, to see the Timberwolves give the Lakers a complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2010/11/04/131075640/how-shellacking-came-to-mean-defeat&quot;&gt;shellacking&lt;/a&gt;. I am so fed up with LeBron James. I can't imagine another team would want him. I can't imagine why he wants to win &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; freaking title. And I was really pissed off when people started saying they were contenders this year. Bull. Shit. And the reason I'm glad it was the Timberwolves is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle&quot;&gt;Julius Randle&lt;/a&gt; is on that team now, and I hear he gets a fair amount of credit for their victory. The Knicks traded him for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns&quot;&gt;KAT&lt;/a&gt; last summer. They're a solid team. And while &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo&quot;&gt;Donte DiVincenzo&lt;/a&gt; isn't playing very well, we really need him back in NY, so maybe the Knicks can figure out a deal that makes sense. And why aren't the Knicks playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa&quot;&gt;Precious Achiuwa&lt;/a&gt;. He did great last year when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby&quot;&gt;OG&lt;/a&gt; was injured. The Knicks have a good bench imho, they just don't get to play enough to be warmed up properly. So sad the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride&quot;&gt;Doooooce&lt;/a&gt; performed in the Detroit series. Anyway it was exhausting. I would have been okay with the DP's winning, seriously -- I'm ready for baseball. And I don't imagine the next series, with the Celtics will be any kind of a walk in the park." created="Sat, 03 May 2025 17:20:21 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Phil Donahue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.today.com/video/flashback-watch-bernie-sanders-today-interview-from-1981-1448099395517&quot;&gt;interview with Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; from 1981, then-mayor of Burlington, VT. He was a novelty then, an American politician who was a socialist. He was asked if capitalism was the normal way for humans to relate, he said no. I wonder if he still agrees, because I think that's the goal, and the reason we're in so much trouble is there really isn't an impulse to work with each other. What I've seen mostly is that when there's work to do, it's hard to find help, but once something has taken off, there isn't much help available either, the people who could make the greatest contribution just want to take over. And they often feel they have, but usually it doesn't work out, it would have been better if we all collaborated. At this point, the hurdle the human race has to get over &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; working together. We will never get out of the climate crisis without it, or avoid the next pandemic without millions of unnecessarily lost lives. The cynics are winning, basically -- and there isn't net-net much of a will for our species to survive. It's only getting worse.

				<outline text="I turned yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/&quot;&gt;Baseline Playground&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. I never made one of these before and thought it was worth sharing, or just writing about. I'm struggling to find the most readable font, size, line-height. I'm looking at the screen where I do most of my online writing, and I find this very readable, it just fades into the background, to the base of the spine, so intrinsic it occupies none of my conscious mind. Anyway the purpose of the baseline is to give WordLand a target to work out all the glitches in, so the writing experience goes fully end-to-end. I didn't find any WordPress themes that I felt worked really well for this, so we set out to create one. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde&quot;&gt;Scott Hansen&lt;/a&gt; who is using my work to build out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline&quot;&gt;WordPress theme&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeherve&quot;&gt;Jeremy Herve&lt;/a&gt; for helping us work with WordPress, which is more than a CMS, it's a network OS.
