					<outline text="The great thing about MLB as compared to the NBA is that the teams play a game pretty much every day. And the Mets, my team since 1962, are really exciting right now, after a month of being lost. They have great rookie pitchers who are full of youthful enthusiasm and they kick ass on the mound. They have veterans who understand their job is to lead and they take that responsibility seriously, and they get on base, steal bases, and hit home runs. And they have workaday athletes who get on base when the team needs a hit. And the most expensive player ever in any sport who's finally playing as part of the team and not someone who misses the old team he used to play on. And they still have the most ridiculously dorky mascot, a caricature of a human with a baseball for a head, and his wife who also has a baseball for a head. Where do they come up with these ideas?

Glad to finally get the whole plan down in one place. Each piece of the puzzle took a while to come together in concept and then in implementation. I'm still working on all levels, last week I added a feature to &quot;FeedLand&quot; that makes it fit in better with the (new) timeline and WordPress (20+ years). It takes a while to change your thinking from WordPress being just another blogging CMS, to being an open platform that hosts &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html&quot;&gt;web writing&lt;/a&gt; in a way that's open to competition. We're on the same page. It's still a competitive environment, but there are rules to competing, you don't cash in the interop that took patience and respect to develop and maintain. That's been the pity of the open web, lots of opportunists who are willing to stink up the ecosystem to squeeze a few more bucks for themselves from things &lt;i&gt;they didn't create.&lt;/i&gt; Let your competitors in, and the users, if they have their heads screwed on right, will respect you for it. And even if they don't, still do it, because it's the right thing to do. That's why, at my age, just turned 70 earlier this year, I'm in a position to help revive the web, because I've made enough money, now it's time to make sure the gift that I got from the open web is available to future generations, no matter how greedy and selfish the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daveverse.org/2025/08/29/the-wealthy-and-dominant-giants-of-tech/&quot;&gt;giants of tech&lt;/a&gt; are. People may question Matt, and that's cool, as I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a142100&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, but also remember he's stood up for your freedom, and that's also important.

					<outline text="I've done this before -- asked people to think differently about things, like public writing, with blogging. In the 90s I was running around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Vallley&lt;/a&gt; trying to explain to everyone that blogging was going to change everything, all I got was blank stares from people who said &quot;we don't do that.&quot; They of course eventually did do it. But at first the ideas seemed foreign, unreasonable." created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:24:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I did it with &quot;RSS&quot; and podcasting. We needed to seed these things, get the ideas in front of people with actual products, with real utility for users. And eventually they came around. " created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:25:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I'm going to ask you to think differently about WordPress, something you thought you already fully understood. " created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:26:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Internally, the software, WordPress, Mastodon, Bluesky, do a lot of the same things. But because WordPress is so long-lived relative to the other two, it's more complete, scaled, it federates easily, lots of people do it. " created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:07:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;important features&lt;/a&gt; the other two don't, although some Mastodon instances are more relaxed about character limits, linking, titles on posts and editing. These are important features. But because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/home&quot;&gt;mother ship&lt;/a&gt; doesn't support all of them, it's hard to represent it without the limits. This can be fixed easily, btw. Just being analytic about it. I like Mastodon and ActivityPub because they provide interop, and that's the name of the game. Make your product but don't lock users in. Interop is your way out if you need to get out. ;-)" created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:08:01 GMT" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/28/thinkDifferentBillboard.png"/>
					<outline text="WordPress has excellent support for &quot;RSS&quot;, esp using a little-known feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/rssCloud/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. It enables realtime notification of new or changed feed items. It's been around since 2009, and like all of WordPress, it's thorougly debugged and scaled. I use it in &quot;FeedLand&quot; and &quot;WordLand&quot;. If you watch the blogroll on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; on the web, you'll see it in action. Or if you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, leave it running and watch the new items show up in realtime without you having to do anything. That's rssCloud. " created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:09:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="WordPress has a deep and powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wpcom.js/tree/master/docs&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, well designed, documented, and they don't break it. Developers who know me know that the last part is the most important. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; must remain unchanging.

					<outline text="And I, Dave Winer, am part of this now, have been for a couple of years, working relatively quietly, building out what I think WordPress needs to get started in this new direction. I am going to help bootstrap a great developer community around all these capabilities. This is something people didn't count on. I have an incredible track record of establishing popular APIs and developer communities. I know how to do this, even wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to how to do it, which apparently has helped other developers create and work on open platforms.

						<outline text="A &lt;b&gt;storage service&lt;/b&gt; where the user owns their writing, so it can be edited by any app they give permission to. This means that app developers don't have to be resellers of storage. This is the biggest economic limiting factor to a large innovative, truly entrepreneurial developer community. Every other network arrangement requires you to raise money or be fearful of having huge support and monetary overhead if you attract too many users. When the Mac market booted up it had none of these limits, the users bought the hardware, we made the software. The web has &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; had the equivalent runtime environment. I'm going to run the server for you to get the bootstrap going. My treat. Until we can get help from infrastructure owners to host the service. And if you want to host it for yourself, it's open source, so you will be able to, without anyone's permission." created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:14:21 GMT"/>
						<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Content&lt;/b&gt;. We won't have to wait for new writers to start using my service.

					<outline text="Finally, in the WordPress world I have to tell you how I feel about the 800-pound gorilla, Automattic. Whatever you think -- key point -- &lt;i&gt;they didn't lock you in.&lt;/i&gt; The community, which I'm just getting to know is very circumspect about everything and that's good and right. It's based on the reality that you never know when or how you're going to lose your freedom, so you always have to watch out. I have looked at this from the inside, from the API and the history, and I've gotten to know a few people at the company, and I trust certain things about them. I don't think they'll necessarily listen to you, or me -- and they can get in the way, but I'm willing to take a chance that they won't.  They've kept their open source promise and they run a stable platform. Linux is that way, it offers that kind of stability, and so does WordPress. Much of the world, myself included, haven't paid much attention to WordPress and we have only used a small fraction of its potential. I'm going to try to build on and unlock for other developers, a whole new side of the platform." created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:21:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One more thing you should know -- I'm not in it for the money. I just want to help the web heal from all the abuses  it has taken over the years. They took paradise and blew big holes in it that users couldn't find a way out of. They undermined open formats and protocols. They lied to the users, all the time, over and over. Now I don't object to making money, but I'm putting it out there, you can compete with me, I want you to compete with me, as long as you don't try to cut off the interop. And I'm not naive, believe me, I expect that will happen. " created="Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:19:50 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Everyone has heard of WordPress, right? I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages.

Until &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601&quot;&gt;Ken Smith&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way&quot;&gt;this quote&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson&quot;&gt;Ted Nelson&lt;/a&gt; in the original 1989 proposal by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; for what would become the web. &quot;Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way.&quot; I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt;, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is &quot;unconstrained.&quot; If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.

				<outline text="I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience.

It's hard to watch at times, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes&quot;&gt;main character&lt;/a&gt; of the show, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is such a horrible person. She lies to everyone about everything, but she's cute and the VCs like her, so they pump hundreds of millions of dollars into her startup, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, which was a real company, and made a product that never worked, but she doesn't get around to telling anyone that, including the board of directors, until long after it's too late. I haven't reached the end yet, but I know how it ends, because it's based on a true story. She ends up in the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Camp,_Bryan&quot;&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell&quot;&gt;Ghislaine Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; is in, in Texas. The only reason I mention it is that in my tenure in Silicon Valley, about 30 years worth, I saw everything she did, done by other entrepreneurs and VCs, in real life. Only now, in the second Trump administration, its craptitude is maxed out far beyond anything I saw personally. They're selling the biggest lie yet, that they've invented machines that think. This is not true, and it's so big a lie, its too-big-to-fail quotient is far higher than anything we've seen before. ChatGPT should stop pretending to be human because that will destroy real humans who believe it. But the euphoria is so great, they're probably going to continue to insist it is capable of thought, and that leads to something far worse than Theranos, or any of the other billion-dollar scams they have foisted on us previously.

				<outline text="I recorded a good podcast yesterday about how I develop new stuff like podcasting, and how it only works if there isn't a huge dominant platform vendor to FUD the project. That's why RSS worked, sort of -- we did get FUDded by the RDF folk, who had a few famous people on their list of co-authors, and it put a big scar on RSS when it was just starting to grow. We cleaned up their mess after a while, and then it boomed, thanks to the New York Times. This is what usually happens, in markets that are controlled by a big company. Google has that effect, so does Apple as does the W3C. They force everything to stop and go through a process that simply doesn't work, it doesn't yield innovation in the market, because it wasn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/10/howToBootstrapFederated140.html&quot;&gt;bootstrapped&lt;/a&gt;.  That's why I don't like the idea of &quot;Podcasting 2.0&quot; whatever it is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@adam@podcastindex.social/114978962778121264&quot;&gt;Adam Curry says&lt;/a&gt; on Masto that it's all a big misunderstanding, but that's what the RDF people said too. Who cares what the name is. Everyone cares, when it comes to the name of a standard or protocol. And when you have an Apple or Google or IETF  trying to confuse people about what you're doing, well you can't make any progress on interop. They freeze everything because users and developers will wait for them. Of course that's what &quot;Podcasting 2.0&quot; is all about. To make all the ideas flow through &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasting2.org/&quot;&gt;one place&lt;/a&gt;. And whoever they are (ChatGPT &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/07/isTherePodcastingTwoPointOh.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's Adam Curry btw) they didn't even bring the power of an Apple or Google to the table. They have nothing other than their aspiration to own the name of an open format and protocol that made the world a little happier for a while. For that of course someone has to try to own it. That's basically what I said, in a very long-winded way, in the podcast. I also talked about ways we could move forward anyway even though there is a 800-pound would-be gorilla trying to own our playground. Maybe I'll just release the podcast as-is and ask you all to indulge me for my need to say the same thing far too many times with so much vigor. :-)" created="Thu, 07 Aug 2025 11:24:57 GMT" type="outline"/>

I wanted to take the time to write perfect code for this one problem. Not dense, not particularly efficient. No matter how inefficient the code is, on today's hardware such a function couldn't use any time at all. It's fair to say I've solved this problem before, but there was always more to it. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/d61110c1d74eb1162ebc726c09dd22f1&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;.
