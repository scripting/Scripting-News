				<outline text="Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/07/29/aiIsARevolution.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how AI is a revolution. I had just listened to a New Yorker podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/wireds-katie-drummond-on-what-the-tech-titans-learned-from-doge&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief&quot;&gt;EIC&lt;/a&gt; at Wired, saying the hype was bullshit. You hear this from journalists a lot. The only way you can conclude this, imho, is if you aren't using the stuff. It's as if you were a journalist in the 60s and said the story of the Beatles is that their hair must be fake. OK, whatever you say, but have you listened to the freaking music?? I'm sure a lot of journalists in the 60s said bullshit like that but the Beatles did turn the world upside down, and it stayed that way. It marked the beginning of something very new. And, as with AI, &lt;i&gt;journalism missed the story&lt;/i&gt;. If you don't trust the CEOs, that's okay, probably the right approach. But that doesn't mean they're wrong about the value of the tech. Develop sources the old fashioned way, and if you think money biases the CEOs in favor of the hype, listen to experts who don't have any stock in the companies.

I did something unusual, I fixed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/07/28.html#a122818&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and cleared up some of the ideas. It was an important post and equally important to get it right.

				<outline text="Now here's the real reason I need &quot;WordLand&quot; and if you write for WordPress sites, I think you'll want it too. It's because WordPress is like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word&quot;&gt;Microsoft Word&lt;/a&gt; of web writing. If you ask someone how they do their site, in 2025, it's probably going to be WordPress. So if someone invites you to write a guest post on their blog, chances are pretty good I can write it in WordLand, and it'll be archived in my collection of writing, and easy for me to find, because that's what WordLand does for writers. So I was able to create the new post on the WordCamp site in less than a minute, and it was completely painless. And that's the point.

				<outline text="But what about Substack and Ghost? A lot of people do their writing there too? What about those people. Here's the cool part for all people who write on the web. The API we use in WordLand to hook up to WordPress is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js&quot;&gt;open and documented&lt;/a&gt;. They don't break their APIs in WordPressLand. At least so far. You could say that API is a standard. And I bet it would be a lot easier for Ghost, for example, to support a limited subset of that API than it has been to get ActivityPub support implemented. Because the WordPress API is what I would call &quot;really simple,&quot; and that's the thing I value most about a good API.  " created="Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:11:02 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Why I need &quot;WordLand&quot;. I’m primarily a writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each podcast is in writing the show notes.

Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the block-oriented work once, outside of the writing environment, then flow my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady workflow thru the block editor, but these are workflows for designers and programmers. WordLand is the flow for writers.  " created="Mon, 28 Jul 2025 12:28:18 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/09/09/poe3.png"/>

Here's my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it when you're feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an act of self-love and give you some of the body &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin&quot;&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; that you felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian Trail.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@scripting@daveverse.org/114907962089898612&quot;&gt;Question&lt;/a&gt;: I have a site with a well developed set of categories, I've added to it carefully over a few months, it covers most of the topics I write about. Another site has a small set of categories. I write all my WordPress posts in the same editor, and could easily set it up so that all categories were available to me in every site I post to. The question: Is that a good practice in the world of WordPress? I noticed that categories are given global ID's so if I use a category like &quot;movies&quot; it will have the same ID as yours has on your sites. I love this idea of a global namespace for categories, and see it as something that could be adopted by sites written in any other writing environment. Anyway, if you have a moment to comment, I'd appreciate your ideas.

					<outline text="The web is the structure connecting the documents. The documents were pretty standard stuff, designed to work like printed documents produced by word processing and page layout software. Web pages had one feature that could only be approximated on the printed page, the footnote, which gave you a pointer to the source of a quote, or a place to find more information. But the pointer wasn't machine readable, it might have included the title of a book, it's author and its publication date, or a magazine article, indicated by the title of the magazine and its cover date. Like most inventions the web page was designed as a derivative of what came before.  " created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:29:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Basic features of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; include: a title, paragraphs, subtitles, styling (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), numbered and bulleted lists. " created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:32:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A web page might be part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; which includes many pages with a common format that link between themselves in the form of a table of contents, navigation links, and possibly an index.  " created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:15:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; were the big innovation of the web. They work like footnotes on a printed page, but in this medium, the links are machine-readable and had an easy user interface. A link would be shown in a special style, initially underlined text, and when you hover the mouse over the link the cursor turns to an arrow, inviting the user to click. " created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:35:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When you click a link, the software accesses the web address that's encoded invisibly in the text of the page, and it loads that page into the browser, replacing the previous page.  The new page can have links, and the pages it links to have links, and there is the web. It's an invisible thing, but it's very real. The need to link was always there, but until graphic computers and fast standardized and easy networking, it wasn't possible. TBL's genius was that he stumbled across this idea, was intrigued, and made it work. It really was new and it turns out revolutionary. A lot could be built, it turns out, based on this one simple difference between electronic and printed pages. And up till that point in time there had never been an electronic page! I kid you not. I grew up in that world, the web-less world. " created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:56:05 GMT"/>

					<outline text="But there's even more to the web. If it had been the product of a company, we never would have seen the explosion of innovation that came about in the years after its introduction. Anyone who had a net connection and a personal computer could run their own site on the web. There were no gatekeepers. And the design of the web technology is so simple that it was hard to understand exactly what it was because there's almost nothing to it. And it was very low cost to start up, you could start building a website in a few minutes. Many of the biggest companies on the web today were started by one or two people working on their own with nothing but time and ideas. They didn't have to get permission. &lt;i&gt;They had the same ability to extend the web as TBL did.&lt;/i&gt; That's such a key point. Today if I want to extend xxx or yyy, well that's a very large undertaking, I'd probably have to reinvent the whole thing just to try out a simple idea. That's how you know you're not on the web, if the ability to innovate is exclusive. " created="Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:40:36 GMT">

There was a little basic technology that I built on but most of what you're looking at was a single person's doing. This was just one year after TBL opened his web to the world.

You could do two-way links today because relational databases are mature and inexpensive to operate, perform very well on today's hardware, and the internet of 2025 is much faster than the internet of 1990.

				<outline text="I found another thing that's possible in the age of ChatGPT. A few years ago I wondered if a product existed. I wanted a small footprint audio amplifier, with that could control a pair of high-end tower speakers I've had for a long time. I was tired of huge receiver boxes with buttons and dials and inputs for all kinds of audio input. I no longer have a phonograph or a CD or tape player. Just one audio input coming from the TV, that gets all its input from an Apple TV box (or the one made by Google or Amazon or whoever). It should have a volume control and an equalizer. And forget about dials, it should all be controlled from an app on my phone. But most important, it has to be small and happy with wireless connections except for the crucial connections. If such a product existed five years ago I couldn't find it. But last night I was roaming around on my iPad while watching the news, and thought to ask this: &quot;I have two good speakers, need a modern amplifier that takes HDMI eArc input and powers the speakers. I want something simple and small.&quot; Well yes, turns out such products do exist.

				<outline text="A story about listening to friends vs competitors. Back in the early 90s I was working on system-level scripting for the Mac, supposedly with Apple, but it's no secret the rank and file at Apple didn't like us. They were told by the execs they had to work with us. So when it came time for WWDC, they &quot;forgot&quot; to invite me to speak on behalf of the new stuff. Instead, they had Bill Gates do it, even though Microsoft was not involved yet, they would support the tech in their Mac products eventually, esp their MSIE web browser. Anyway, I was friends with their top PR person, so she called me up a few days before the conference and asked what Bill should say, and I gave her an outline, and when he gave the speech, he did a great job.
