Let someone else ride around in this car that I love, but hate because it is a symbol of American terrorism and apartheid.  This is compatible with my understanding that hate is love that was betrayed. I'm sure I won't love its replacement as much as I loved the Model Y, but I will feel better about driving it. And Tesla shareholders will, I hope, learn the lesson that products must be politically agnostic in order to work commercially. Or if you must take a stand, make it &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; fascism. So many of our oligarchs have made the wrong bet here. We will never forget what Zuckerberg, Bezos, the CEOs of Apple, Microsoft, Open AI -- all these companies went the wrong way.

						<outline text="Fun. If I can fill a need that I think users will want, without being resented too much by the platform vendor then I might take a jump knowing full well that the better the idea the quicker the vendor will kill me. For that reason it's better to do something they don't understand, or will see as irrelevant, ie a &quot;third party opportunity.&quot; As soon as it appears to be &quot;system software,&quot; that's when they started the project to eat your lunch. ;-)" created="Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:27:33 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The API works the way you think. This has been the highest hurdle for me to get over in most platforms I think about working with. I can't tell you how many times I've stared at the docs for a platform and have no idea how it relates to the product, which I know how to use. The concepts should mirror the functionality of the system it's the API for. Too much theory and I have to be very very motivated for other reasons to get through the fog.

					<outline text="Thing is if there is a platform vendor, they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; kill you, no matter what they say. I once had a big platform vendor say they weren't trying to crush me. I could see on his face he realized he had just given up their plan, or how else would that term be in his head as applied to me. Never mind, I was already commited so what difference did it make. " created="Fri, 31 Jan 2025 22:55:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reason for all this is that as they grow, platform vendors hire employees to work on this stuff, and they resent independent developers. This surprised me when I first encountered it. I thought we were siblings, brothers and sisters. But they idealize our situation and only see the pain in theirs. So they will enjoy killing you. It will eventually happen.

The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that stopped the Vietnam war, btw).

				<outline text="One more thing then I have to get back to work. There's a great moment in Woody Allen's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(1973_film)&quot;&gt;Sleeper&lt;/a&gt; where a time traveler was told that the world was destroyed when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2fYguIX17Q&amp;t=130s&quot;&gt;Albert Shanker&lt;/a&gt; got hold of a nuclear warhead. If you lived in NYC in the 70s and 80s you knew &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker&quot;&gt;Albert Shanker&lt;/a&gt; as a NY character like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton&quot;&gt;Al Sharpton&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa&quot;&gt;Curtis Sliwa&lt;/a&gt;.  New York &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez&quot;&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; its own semi-celebrities, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow&quot;&gt;were&lt;/a&gt; famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin&quot;&gt;mostly&lt;/a&gt; in New York, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Abzug&quot;&gt;but&lt;/a&gt; not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Koch&quot;&gt;as&lt;/a&gt; much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay&quot;&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt;. So Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn't know it, back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it still feels like he's only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way.

					<outline text="This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I've been doing feed readers for a long time. They've been mostly organized around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like systems work.

It came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do -- I offered to do something like that for him.

					<outline text="My first thought, ridiculous -- can't be done. They have all these limits that aren't present in HTML. I don't have any idea how I could make this work. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what a river looks like in FeedLand.

				<outline text="To answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lgbutbllnk2b&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban's question&lt;/a&gt; of what could we do now to make things better. I forgot that I have two ready-made answers. First, let's get the Democrats or whatever its successor is called, on the air 365 days a year, every year, not just in election years, and have it do many things other than raise money to buy ads. We need to always be communicating with each other not just in season. You could see we had a problem when Obama's campaign website, which should have become whitehouse.gov was turned into a stupid feature of the site where people could petition their government. It said to voters, thanks we'll take it from here. We all saw that as putting us in our place. We must be invoved in governing, not just electing. Second, for podcasts and what's left of journalism, it should all move out out of the northeast and into the country. The hosts should be in St Louis, Dallas, Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle, Phoenix even Memphis, Miami and Charleston. That would change the focus not only symbolically, but they could insist that guests go there to be interviewed. Change the meaning of flyover country. People would feel different about the country and that would come through. Democrats tend to cater their ideas to people in the Northeast. This part of what Repubs say is very true. They do the same thing, only worse, but they are smart about pretending they don't. Third, amplify AOC. She's the leader we need. The Dems are too scared of Republican criticism. Stop worrying so much. If they're complaining that means it's working. Her interview on Jon Stewart's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/867-the-weekly-show-with-jon-s-86469341/episode/jon-aoc-260531325/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; this week is wonderful." created="Thu, 23 Jan 2025 16:46:29 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/23/aoc.png"/>

The question was will there be a war over this? Well, I reasoned, as I assumed the incoming president would, that it's better if you have to fight a civil war to do it when the military is responsible to you. But then a few months turned into a couple of years, and nothing happened. No indictments. He hadn't been arrested. I thought geez if we had done something like what he did, the scale of it, the audacity, the terror, my god how could he be left to walk around as if nothing had happened. I figured there must be a reason and our president had a plan. He didn't. Neither did journalism. When Trump ran for re-election he got the consideration any major party candidate would get from the press. As he is getting now as a newly sworn-in president. But we know his oath is meaningless.

				<outline text="How easy would it be to create a twitter-like app using RSS, and in what ways would it differ from other twitter-like apps. Here's the deal. You need a place to write a posts and a way to read a timeline of posts. That's the basic functionality. To do that with RSS you would start with a blogging app like WordPress, and a feed reader like &quot;FeedLand&quot; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;. Manton has integrated the two into a single user interface at &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to approach it in a somewhat differently, not sure yet how it will work, but I'm getting there.

I can search for ideas and it creates a story, like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for 'Madison' where I had love, fun, creativity, friends, youth, music, strength, health, sex, and could see the future clearly.

Pick another term get another synthetic story.&quot; Ironically, since my linkblog doesn't flow through the search engine, I would have lost this post. Which makes a bigger point.

I started working at UW 28 years ago today as the World Wide Web Editor in the Office of News and Public Affairs. My first project was to implement Userland Frontier for the university news page.&quot; Now Nick is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison&quot;&gt;my Madison story&lt;/a&gt; too. And he mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=UserLand%20Frontier&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. With Frontier, we not only had the internet over networks, we also had networks on our computers because Frontier could send tasks to scriptable apps, and get back results. So databases could be hooked up to page layout programs, and people could use their writing tool of choice, and didn't have to use some teeny little excuse for an editor provided by a company that doesn't cater to or care about writers. Imagine writing with software that was designed to hobble writers instead of glorify them! That's the horror of the world as proposed by Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, all of them. It's like no one stopped to think about what they are doing, half their product is writing, and they suck at writing and have no plans to improve the situation.

Why should I put a bullshit editor in a product (Bingeworthy) that isn't about writing. Its job is very different from WordLand's. Let them work together.

					<outline text="I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks.

					<outline text="One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/&quot;&gt;half of the report&lt;/a&gt; on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;enough followers&lt;/a&gt; to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up. It's very hard to get away from companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately.

If you give me that much time, I'll change the way you see the world, or at least the way you see me. I think I'm right about this, with another layer on top of the WordPress foundation, it becomes newly relevant, and very timely, in ways that as far as I know, no one has been pushing it. I think for example that Ghost and Substack should be built on top of WordPress. The fact that they aren't gives a clue as to how portable your work is there, and how little choice you get in writing tools. Anyway, please make the time to listen.

Maybe at times there were competing ways to do things, like the way Bluesky and ActivityPub, and probably Threads, and certainly Facebook and Twitter insist on reinventing &quot;RSS&quot;. But when I ask ChatGPT &quot;can you do this in MySQL&quot; it gives me one or two ways to do it, but usually just one. These are things I never would have found in the old Google-search way of finding answers. An example, I wanted to find out if there was a MySQL way to query a value inside a JSON object, and the answer is (of course) yes. And you can create an index on such a value. I didn't even ask for it, ChatGPT volunteered, guessing it would be my next question (it was). Whatever happened in the evolution of SQL it was a lot healthier than what's going on now in the social web, where the creators completely ignored what came before, and each other, and as a result there's a proliferation of different ways to do things we've known how to do for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html&quot;&gt;over 20 years&lt;/a&gt;. SQL has been around for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#History&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe they went through this stage and emerged from it with a better answer. This feels a bit like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/677bf6d0-b868-8012-af56-7e4449e9182f&quot;&gt;Fermi paradox&lt;/a&gt; and I'm a time traveler who has managed to witness 50 years of evolution long after the fact, any day of any week I want to thanks to ChatGPT. Also this is why it is so important to keep the archives of the 1990's web preserved. We may need to loop back to this when the people responsible for the social web decide that interop is important as opposed to each of them going it alone.

				<outline text="How I'd write books with &quot;WordLand&quot;. Just thinking out loud here. Working with a group of people. It's possible it's just the author and editor, or it could be a larger documentation job, or a report covering a lot of ground. In 2025 we'd use AI to find the threads in our writing, to maintain a book outline that changes as our writing goes forward. Gone is the problem of writing a chapter structure before doing any writing. I've always found that to be a real obstacle to getting started. I've yet to use a ChatGPT-like service to do this, but I expect it can be done. I'm thinking about how I can set up an experiment for &quot;WordLand&quot; for writing this kind of book. The first test case could be the docs for WordLand. I would write a post about a feature as I thought about it, but not worry about how it fits into the rest of the book. Trust the AI organizer to help us do something sensible. " created="Mon, 06 Jan 2025 14:57:12 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/02/08/nancy.png"/>

				<outline text="The crazy thing about Bluesky's API is they took already standardized things like links and enclosures, and after 20+ years came up with new definitions. Makes our apps more expensive to maintain, and we waste time and human wear and tear on stupid bullshit make-work. Developers are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we're working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let's throw some more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism, whatever the source is, it's not a good way to introduce yourself. And, even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error message about &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834&quot;&gt;legacy blob&lt;/a&gt; bullshit. They've already done this, and they're just getting started. It's why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying to force us to adapt to them. I'll do it one more time, and then that's it. They can fix my code next time they break it.  " created="Sun, 05 Jan 2025 15:28:29 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage3.png"/>
				<outline text="BTW, in defense of Matt Mullenweg and the culture of the developer community he built over the last 20 years, for better or worse, they don't do what Bluesky did. They look for prior art and implement it and they don't deprecate. They're still running the APIs we invented for blogging before WordPress even existed. The philosophy is &quot;Let's not argue about decisions made a long time ago, because &lt;i&gt;we want interop.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;People have all kinds of harsh things to say about their leadership, but unless you're a developer you don't understand that the reason it works is that they have a different code for their code, the only way we get interop is by &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;not re-inventing&lt;/a&gt;. There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don't reallllly want us to work with them, or we wouldn't be having this friction. Their API is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; where everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;gets&lt;/a&gt; to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too.
