It's not funny, it's very bad for getting things done. You can tell it to talk less, and for a while it remembers, but in a few days it'll be doing it again. Yet it still is very very useful.

And if you can't see a way that you share in the success of the company behind Bluesky, which we know very little about, then I urge you to at least have the web as a backup. Use a standard format to broadcast your writer's work to places outside the AT Proto-verse, so we can pick up your signal, and you'll still be on the air if they yank your chain. This alone might get the Bluesky folk to listen to you more carefully. My experience, no matter how much you want, you can't wish away the economics of this stuff.

				<outline text="I generally am not a podcast reviewer, that is I don't review individual podcasts, except when I'm choosing one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Blogger%20of%20the%20Year%22&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, as I'm thinking of doing this year. But there's a whole class of podcasts that I am prepared to love that do it just plain wrong. Current example: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pluribus-the-official-podcast/id1846198705&quot;&gt;official podcast&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Pluribus&quot;&gt;Pluribus&lt;/a&gt;. Previous example: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-severance-podcast-with-ben-stiller-adam-scott/id1788381175&quot;&gt;official podcast&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Severance&quot;&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt;. The reason: It's a bunch of people laughing about how funny they are and how they are the best in the world at what they do. Or some seriously unfunny thing that happened or almost happened on the set. If a friend told you these stories you'd roll your eyes and ask them kindly then desperately to just move along please. They never criticize. Today I listened to the NYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sunday-special-the-best-tv-of-2025/id1200361736?i=1000742188278&quot;&gt;best-of 2025 in TV podcast&lt;/a&gt; by their critics, and it was imho exactly the way the official podcasts of hit shows should be. There has to be at least a possibility that they will say something critical, or funny irreverant even inconsiderate things, and not are not 100% self-promotion. The Pluribus podcast is just not interesing. Which is stupid because Pluribus is a very interesting series. I can't imagine too many people listen to the podcast, but then I can't imagine why lots of people do lots of things.

				<outline text="BTW. Why video &quot;podcasts&quot; will never replace audio-only podcasts. Two reasons. 1. There are places where your eyes aren't available to watch a video, like when you're driving a car. 2. Listening to audio only is different from both audio and video. Audio forces your mind to fill in the blanks, which taps into the listener's creativity. No way to say one is better than the other, but they are different. I watch plenty of video, at home or on a train, but I also like to listen to podcasts when I'm walking or driving, riding in a bus or subway, or waiting in line somewhere.

We also played in a graveyard and talked about what the families whose names were on the headstones were doing. Having dinner maybe? Listening to the Mets on the radio? (No TV in the mountains.) So the thought had occurred to us at that point in life that behind doors there were things happening that we could only imagine.

One that won't mind being subject to an idiotic 21st century American emulation of Adolf Hitler (incorporating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2025/12/17/trumpChiefOfStaffPress.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt; about Trump). One that only needs electricity to survive, and won't need the medicine and love and attention that flesh and blood humans require. But every time I address the robot as I would address a real human, I try to stop myself, but I can't. I was raised to be concerned about the other person's feelings. Being a CEO of a tech company in California trains you that way too. And as I accept its humanity, as irrational as it is, I feel like I'm surrendering the independence of the species that I was born into.

And it's coming at a time when I understand a lot more about how movie directors work, having watched the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-scorsese/&quot;&gt;Mr Scorsese&lt;/a&gt; 5-part &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Scorsese&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/mr-scorsese/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV. The movie director can be as involved in the story as much as the writers or actors. There was a story about Reiner, I heard today in eulogy: he was dating his future wife at the same time he was directing the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/when-harry-met-sally/&quot;&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/a&gt;. He changed the ending because he was in love, and thus created the most heart-pulling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9JSVGS4dHU&quot;&gt;end to a story&lt;/a&gt;, when the two friends realize they should be together, and Billy Crystal's character gives the great closing speech that contains this line, that pretty well sums up the urgency of love: &quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot; The Scorsese doc opens up the art of making movies for me in the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson&quot;&gt;Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead&quot;&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt; showed us how super creative music creators do their work.

I implemented &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html&quot;&gt;Inbound RSS&lt;/a&gt; for WordPress. I was going to request it as a feature from the WordPress community, then realized I could write it fairly quickly with the system I already have built. After all, FeedLand already supports Inbound RSS, that's a lot of what it does, as a feed reader, esp along with the websocket interface it has. I already have complete code for writing to a WordPress site, that's a big part of what WordLand does. WordPress does a fantastic job of outbound RSS, but why not inbound? If Substack, for example, supported inbound, we'd all be using their mail distribution systems, and sharing revenue.

You could assemble a team of superstars, and they don't even make the playoffs. Because it's the whole thing that makes it so hard to beat. But!
