Usually I don't criticize a service when it's down, because I can relate. We like to help each other when there are outages. But Bluesky is special, because they claim to be decentralized. If it were, it wouldn't go down unless the internet itself had. And since the internet, amazingly, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; decentralized, that's not likely to happen. It was designed that way when it was developed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET&quot;&gt;Arpanet&lt;/a&gt;, a project of the US Department of Defense. It was designed to survive a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Inspiration&quot;&gt;nuclear strike&lt;/a&gt;. Bluesky is nice, but it's fragile, and their hype says otherwise. That's why they're special. They should straighten this out so we can properly get decentralization into &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; networks. Bluesky could easily add a layer of &quot;RSS&quot; on top of what they have, so that news flow could survive a disaster.  In 2025 this is a realistic concern, as it was in the 1960s. Also it would be nice if other network experts would support this, esp if they're on Bluesky. This is not personal, if they wanted to get the RSS layer built, I would help them do it. We should all pitch in because then it would really be our network, and not owned by anyone.

I'm going to experiment in a very small app first, to make sure I have the approach right, then I will cautiously make the change on my test WordLand server, and if it works there, then I will figure out how to install it on the main site.

I love the term he uses, the &quot;shape&quot; of Twitter. Each decision we make in developing our means of discourse &lt;i&gt;shapes&lt;/i&gt; the discourse. And with the character limit and the inability to edit, and the incentives are all wrong (I can tap into your follower flow without your permision just by posting a reply) it makes almost all twitter-like discourse spam or abusive. I'm planning a different structure for discourse in the world shaped by WordLand. A reply will only be visible to the person who you're replying to. If &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; want others to see it, they can make it public. It's their choice. So you probably should be respectful if you're looking for a flow boost. You can turn off all discourse if you want, giving the ability to finish a thought. We've learned so much about this in the 19 years since Twitter started. It's time to break out of the limits.

In that we are just as deluded as the people who think Trump is a genius who understands business and thus will do a great job of running the world economy, a power no previous president had dared to exercise, not even sure they knew they had such power. The educational institutions that are being attacked by Trump now, should have played a role in creating effective communication systems, as should journalism. I got up on stage at a NYT event a few years back and begged them to compete with Twitter. One or two people in the audience of a few hundred were inspired by the idea, but the follow-up was nil.

Their vision could be achieved much more quickly by giving up their &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22boil%20the%20ocean%22&quot;&gt;boil the ocean&lt;/a&gt; approach and start taking some simple, very doable steps that would empower outside developers to build a rich ecosystem around their product. The only downside would be that now they really &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be replaceable. Anyway, they're partly there. Right now they support outbound RSS, and are improving it. That's the strategically easy half to do. The one that would really open them up is inbound RSS, the protocol that all the other twitter-like systems refuse to support.

				<outline text="The big vision behind WordLand" created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:04:56 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="I believe that eventually WordPress will be the hub for writers the way the web itself became the the hub for apps. Initially, the web wasn’t the best place to host apps, the Mac had a much more developed set of meaningful features for app devs, and we already knew the Mac APIs where the web was strange and incomplete. " created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:11:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Yet most of the energy in AppLand quickly shifted to the web because of three advantages it had:  " created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:05:06 GMT" flNumberedSubs="true">
						<outline text="Anyone could publish for it, there was no platform vendor." created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:05:10 GMT"/>

						<outline text="The Mac's networking only worked on the Mac at a time when Windows was becoming dominant, and the web offered simplicity that neither platform could match." created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:05:11 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="The web made writing network apps a joy, where the Mac made it a slog. No matter how much time you spent developing, it never resulted in success. "/>
					<outline text="There was no question for me when I saw the web, I had to be there."/>
					<outline text="Substack and Ghost are like Mac and Windows at the dawn of the web. Their big mistake imho is they weren’t built on WordPress, which can and should imho serve as the base platform for writing on the web. If an ecosystem of writing tools is built on the Wordpress foundation how could silo’d writing tools hope to compete? "/>
					<outline text="If you question the choice of Wordpress, what would you go with in its place? I argue that whatever it is, it would work much like Wordpress, which has a 20+ year head start, is stable, scales, is widely supported, and open source, so if you don't like the company behind it, you can choose not to use their distribution."/>
					<outline text="With WordLand we are testing the water hopefully proving that it is possible to create a functional writing environment on the WordPress foundation. Why is that such an advantage? Because, like the word processing products of the 80s on various OSes, these apps should be able to share data. One day you may feel like writing something with WordLand and a few days later you might want to try editing the same document using a different editing tool. As long as they both ingest and emit Markdown, they should have no trouble editing each others' documents. This is where the benefit of a common platform becomes insurmountable, because the silos insist you use their editor and only their editor and an open platform with open data formats lets you move between apps that interop. There’s a reason so many word processors thrived in the 80s, because the needs and tastes of writers vary so much, and technically it was possible to move data around in an ad hoc way."/>
					<outline text="Until WordLand, tools for writers on the Wordpress platform were practically nonexistent. I think that can change now, because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity&quot;&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt; that connects WordLand to Wordpress is both easy to understand, for developers, and open source under the most liberal license. Any app that connects with Wordpress through this API will interop with WordLand so totally that it could replace WordLand. " created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:06:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I would be happy if WordLand played the role of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt; in the Mac ecosystem of the 80s. At the outset it was the only writing tool for the Mac, and set the usability pattern for all that followed. As a result the Mac platform, even though initially its appeal was mainly to developers and designers, quickly boomed as a writer's platform. I strongly believe Wordpress has this potential. " created="Tue, 08 Apr 2025 22:06:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think writers need the same variety and open possibilities as developers, and the existing writer's systems are not offering that choice. I believe this is the start of the writers web, that should, if we do it right, and if my intuition is correct, grow like the web itself at inception. My bet is that an expansive approach will yield far more creativity in a very important area, writing, and should quickly become the place writers want to be."/>

Anyway, the answer is yes, OPML is the native file format of &quot;Drummer&quot;. It's the reason we chose &quot;OPML&quot; as the format for RSS reading lists, so we could edit them in a distant &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217&quot;&gt;ancestor&lt;/a&gt; of Drummer's whose native file format was also OPML. I tend not to change file formats gratuitously -- it's how you can use different tools to edit your own data. That's a big part of the plan with &quot;WordLand&quot;, because the internal file format for drafts is Markdown, you could put any editor alongside that can edit and save text in Markdown, without a glitch. The idea is to create a new platform, editors for WordPress, and have them all interop with each other perfectly from the start. Because WordLand is the first product in this niche, and Markdown is a very safe choice these days (understood to discourage lock-in), I think it's going to be a perfect basis for interop. Learning from past experience and doing it better each time. " created="Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:31:00 GMT" type="outline" image="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2022/12/15/drummer.png"/>
