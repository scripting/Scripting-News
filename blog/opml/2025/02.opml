				<outline text="Podcasts can be pretty awful" created="Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:40:45 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="One of the big flaws of in serial podcasts about TV shows is how the actors talk about how wonderful it is to work with all the specific people in the show, the other actors, directors, costume designers, and on and on. So if there are 100 people working on the show, this adds up to 10,000 testimonials, and they're sooooo boring because they're all the same, and I don't know any of these people, not even the actors. I know the characters in the show. And esp with a show like Severance, where each scene is filled with puzzles, and details you can't see on the first watching or even the fifth, there's so much you want them to talk about, and they never seem to get around to it. " created="Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:40:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The podcast for last week's Severance was the exception. What follows is a spoiler, so if you haven't seen it, you have been warned. For me, the most amazing scene was with the outies, Helena and Mark in what turned out to be Eng's restaurant in Kingston. It was so sexy, flirtatious, a tour de force of everything, and I don't often say that. And the funny thing is, the two bodies have had sex, twice, and only one of them knew about one of the events, and neither of them knew they had done it just a few hours ago! So the sexual attraction between them was real, and consummated. The best part I guess when they just replayed the dialog. So beautifully done, you don't need the video to be able to fully visualize it. "/>
					<outline text="That's what I want -- go deeper into what happened between the characters I know and want to know more about. As soon as you start giggle, know that at least this member of your audience is getting ready to turn you off. (And btw the mutual adoration would be more interesting if they ever say they didn't like someone, but they always just love them, they're the best, they learned so much, I'm not worthy and on and on and on and on.)"/>
					<outline text="This same thing happened a few days ago on the Wirecutter podcast where the people talking were reporters at the NYT who I had never heard of. Someone who reviews mattresses. I was interested in buying a mattress so I thought this would be a good podcast to listen to. But after 15 minutes they still hadn't talked about anything that helped me choose a mattress, which is something I don't know how to do, and I imagine most people don't either, yet it is an incredibly consequential decision. They may have eventually gotten to the point, but I wouldn't know."/>

My favorite scene in the last episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://screenrant.com/severance-season-2-episode-6-why-helena-followed-mark-to-restaurant/&quot;&gt;took place&lt;/a&gt; at a Chinese restaurant.

But even more amazing is that I learned in the podcast that the restaurant mentioned earlier is actually a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engsrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Kingston restaurant&lt;/a&gt; that just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/food/article/engs-chinese-restaurant-kingston-opens-dining-room-20058303.php&quot;&gt;re-opened&lt;/a&gt; after a long hiatus, so I've not yet had a chance to eat there, but I want to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engsrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Eng's&lt;/a&gt;.

I wrote the other day that I feel like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153833&quot;&gt;time traveler&lt;/a&gt;, discovering WordPress 20 years after I left UserLand. I care that it's open source, but I care much more that it's open web esp after we've been so thoroughly dominated by feature-limited silos such as Twitter, Facebook and yes -- even Mastodon and Bluesky. Even if there's a theoretical way to do it, practically speaking we have to wait for their developers to implement the features we want. Open source doesn't help there, but open web does. Matt puts the emphasis on the open source part, that's why it wasn't until very recently that I realized that &lt;i&gt;open web&lt;/i&gt; is more important, to me at least.

					<outline text="I got two responses from &lt;a href=&quot;https://muckrack.com/karoli-kuns&quot;&gt;Karoli Kuns&lt;/a&gt;, an early blogger, and editor at Crooks and Liars, a long-lived blog that if I recall correctly was started with software I wrote in 2002, so I feel some pride in helping in a small way to enable her accomplishments and contributions, which are long-lived and substantial. Both of her responses missed the sadness in my post, the reflectiveness, but rather did what a lot of arguing online devolves to, showing someone else that their thinking is wrong. I couldn't think straight I was so angry, so I just said no, I'm not going to do this.

I hope she reads it, because we're not out of options, and as I say in this story, we should be working together, and as far as I know we are not.

						<outline text="anyway i wrote what i wrote not as a plan but rather a note that we're passing a line, over which there soon won't be any recourse. we probably are already over the line, but if by some miracle the repubs saw clearly that this was the last chance and enough of them decided to do what so far they have been unwilling to do, there would be a fight. i wasn't saying i thought it was likely, which is what your rebuttals were rebutting, i was just sharing a sad observation that i had made earlier in the day when i was thinking this through. i like to do that because it's part of my creativity. sometimes you think of the ideal answer, and it leads you back to an acceptable answer -- in software design and in writing (which is what i do pretty well with lots of experience)."/>
						<outline text="what was really frustrating is that i think you and i should be collaborating. giving me grief over something so ridiculous was about 180 degrees opposite of where i think we should be. that we are still doing this to each other, gives an idea of how we got here. the democrats pick on classes of people, sometimes destroying their lives, and big surprise -- a lot of them vote for the other party. i think you think you can dis me the way you did because of my gender, or age, or race, or who the fuck knows. and for all i know you were just having a bad moment and decided to share it with me for some reason having nothing to do with what was bothering me.

I didn't buy that assumption that WordPress has to be heavy machinery for writers. What if I just want to write something quickly and get back to the other thing I was working on.

					<outline text="I'm trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a writing world where we get the features of &quot;textcasting&quot;. So your belief that the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky. " created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:33:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On the other hand, I'm not saying limits in software aren't good. A product is as much defined by what it can't do as with what it does. All feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it finds in feeds, because RSS doesn't place any limits what you can use. So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed reading software, I've said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who does &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;, and he was quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element in your feeds and in your feed reader.

					<outline text="The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a shame that is. &quot;WordLand&quot;, imho, is exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in &quot;Radio UserLand&quot; in 2002. They were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some reason they didn't. It's so weird to me, I'm like a time traveler who has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of a product like WordPress. It's supposed to be a place writers love to come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It's just a beginning, there's lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to anywhere begins with one step." created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:38:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Back to Bluesky and Mastodon -- because they both support outbound RSS, we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of published feeds.

					<outline text="It's good that you like &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, this isn't in the way of it and it isn't in the way of WordLand.

That right there defines the two products. " created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:45:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate my writing because I couldn't use links, and I couldn't edit or have more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and I had to make a choice. I'm doing it again, but now have made the investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio. " created="Mon, 24 Feb 2025 15:46:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they didn't.

They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing instead of the words themselves.

It's a 20+ year thing, and they've done an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; job of maintaining compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s still works today.

				<outline text="I don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3likjorqzmk23&quot;&gt;social networks&lt;/a&gt; as they're currently configured. The idea that it's some kind of conversation -- no it really doesn't resemble a conversation. I would like to try a social network that didn't have the concept of replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn't be able to insert something into someone else's flow, which is where all the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the person it's in reply to, so you don't end up getting speeches under your posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don't bother reading anything that's related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can enter the flow. We've been doing this, the way we do it, since the inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics, specifically graph theory -- and the Twitter way of organizing people and discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged. Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can't intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or whatever bullshit the influencers have made up).

Very important, because the Repub margin there is only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it's going to take a long long time to come back from this.

The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company. I was the CEO. " created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:03:51 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn't work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately. " created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 15:31:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don't take orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That's why Musk and Trump are having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works, because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have rights that must be respected. That &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be respected or all hell will break loose. " created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:11:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you, the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you didn't have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the US, until they aren't a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren't going to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or young, LBGTQ or whatever -- we all are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state&quot;&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt;, ie we don't have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might take some getting used to by him). We don't take orders from him, or anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special circumstances. " created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:12:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you're supposed to sit here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction. The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they're fucking with, and they don't want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short time because you can't be part of the disaster they're creating. And always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has done with Twitter, as we've seen many SV companies have. But again, for the 18th time, &lt;i&gt;the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley company.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:10:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn't know he had terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes men, they never would have told him. And he didn't want to hear it from a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large organizations are nothing compared with the United States. " created="Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:17:43 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he's making it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would be if what he was doing wasn't so blatantly outrageous. We never voted for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference, thinks their own vote should count. That's going to be a massive hurdle for them to get over.

				<outline text="I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. He won't just control the US government, he will control the world economy." created="Sun, 02 Feb 2025 19:58:52 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Given what Musk is doing now, do you think the internet will still be here in a year? Will there be any tech companies that aren't wholly owned by Musk, Inc. Will owning things even mean anything? Or is this the beginning of the rule of the tech bros, world wide. I can't imagine what they're planning for us. In the meantime, me divesting my Tesla, which seemed so urgent just 24 hours ago, now seems like a powerless gesture. I heard it said that now feels like the moment in Covid when you realized everything was about to freeze, and you'd better head to the supermarket right now, and when you got there, you found you weren't among the first to see it this way. I was very reassured by the blog post that Krugman did. It's nice to hear a sane voice out there.
