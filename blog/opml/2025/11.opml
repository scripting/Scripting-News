				<outline text="Hypothetically, if someone were building a headless version of &quot;Frontier&quot; with help from ChatGPT, they might be thinking about how to build a web app that was a really good shell to start with. If such a person asked what I thought, I would say without a doubt that would be &quot;Drummer&quot;. The reason is it was designed for that purpose, because I needed many of the features of Frontier for my work environment, and as you know Frontier was built around the outliner, object database and verb set, back in 1988. Anyway, I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;wrote a doc&lt;/a&gt; in April of 2020, that went through all the features of Drummer as a scripting environment. It's as if it were designed for such a hypothetical project. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1764514479000&quot;&gt;new intro&lt;/a&gt; from the point of view of 2025. It might be interesting to write another intro in 2030, knock wood, Praise Murphy, I am not a lawyer and (as far as I know) my mother loves me.

				<outline text="I love getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/342#issuecomment-3592400879&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; like this. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/29/165203.html&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; I posted about yesterday turns out to be a bug, and apparently it's going to be fixed. So I can go ahead without worrying about a workaround. This is the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; outcome. Usually with most vendors if there's a bug, they don't acknowledge, and then they might get around to looking at it someday. This is what I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22working%20together%22&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;. Scott Hanson found the thread where they were discussing the feature in question, starting in 2011. I added an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/996#issuecomment-3592597547&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; from 2025. This stuff feels like time travel, and it's also incredibly reassuring to find that solutions to issues that were relevant 14 years ago are still relevant today. That's the stability that platforms require in order for developers to build with confidence. This is something that many big tech companies (cough Apple cough) either don't understand or don't care about.

					<outline text="Happy belated Thanksgiving. I was so busy yesterday, didn't have the time to do my usual Thanksgiving gratitude post. And I do have a few things to be thankful for this year. " created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:32:48 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="First I want to thank all the non-technical peoople who read this blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribe.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;every day&lt;/a&gt;. This has been one of the very nicest things about writing this blog, going back to 1994, there have been quite a few people who skim the technical posts, of which there have been many these days, as I am preparing to try to shake up the world of discourse on the net, hoping to get it back on the track it was on before the silos came along and monetized us. Ultimately, if it happens, we will all benefit, techies and non-techies alike. " created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:37:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I thank you all for your patience and indulgence. " created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:18:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Most of the non-tech readers I hear from are women, btw. My mother for example was a regular reader. For whatever reason, pleasing women is about 1,000,000 times more important to me than pleasing men. Possibly because I had a gutsy mother who programmed me that way. Almost nothing makes me happier." created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:17:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thing that makes me unreasonably happy is to be back in touch with most of the developers who worked with me at UserLand on Frontier. Starting wtih Jake Savin, and then André Radke, Brent Simmons and Wes Felter. And esp with Brent, who went on to write NetNewsWire, the hugely popular feed reader for Mac OS. This means so much to me. I spent years bouncing ideas off Brent and listening to what he said very carefully. I also strived to pass on through each of them my values of software, computer networks, and our responsibilities to users. Each of them are different, have different strengths, but they are all lovely human beings. Reconnecting this year wasn't in any way a goal of mine, it just happened that way. " created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:38:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thing that makes me absolutely optimistic about the future is to discover the compatibility between the vision of the web that I shared with many of the early web developers, again going back to 1994 and the following years, and today's developers of WordPress. We occupy different spaces in tech, I'm a web developer who works in JavaScript in the browser and Node.js, and they work in PHP and their own platform, but as I opined &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/27/145439.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, you can use the web to connect all flavors of things, by design. I used the criticism that Mastodon and WordPress are like &lt;a href=&quot;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges&quot;&gt;apples and oranges&lt;/a&gt;, an American idiom that usually connotes incompatibility, but on the web, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; connect apples and oranges. Differences are negotiable, you have to remember that -- and taking advantage of the web that way is what it was created for. Like the internet it was built on, the web makes it possible for very different things to work together, and in doing so makes it possible for &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; to work together too. " created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:41:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I know I've thanked him before, but it's worth doing again -- thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; for his very timely invention of the web, which set users and developers everywhere free, only to have the siloers re-emerge fourteen years after its advent to give power back to the bankers, with the predictable, disastrous results. Our political system suffered a massive virtual oil spill thanks to Twitter, which we have yet to begin to clean up. As a result health care is in a very precarious state. It has been used as an instrument of war. Who could have imagined that a cutely-named system like Twitter could do all that damage, but it did. " created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:46:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="TBL gave us a taste of freedom. Many of the WordPress community leaders are too young to have had that taste, but they still believe in it. And that's probably the most important thing to be thankful for. And maybe it's not the only tech community that has that inspiration at its core. And maybe that feeling extends beyond tech?" created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 14:14:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We build bubbles to contain us, to make the communities we're part of smaller and thus more manageable. But if we do it right, we can be part of the Macintosh world and the WordPress world, and build the proper interfaces to our work so we're also part of the web. That's where the magic comes from. The unforseen connections that &quot;just work&quot; the first time. That's where I've chosen to work as I approach the end of my career -- on the intersections that route around the silos and return the power of the web to the people.

				<outline text="Connecting apples and oranges on the web" created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:54:39 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="This is a really good &lt;a href=&quot;https://passthejoe.wordpress.com/2025/11/26/dave-winer-is-right-mastodon-is-harder-to-host-than-wordpress/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, in response to a post I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/11/26/152547.html#a152819&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that said among other things that a WordPress instance is easier to set up on your own server than Mastodon. " created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:41:48 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="At the start of the piece he said it was like comparing apples and oranges, but by the end, he was starting to see that they kind of do the same thing. I am prepared to explain that. " created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:54:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First what they have in common is that they deal with posts, and they have more or less the same features. Mastodon for historic reasons, places limits on posts. I'm sure they could relax those limits, so I don't see this as an important difference. " created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:55:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And then there's all the traffic that comes into a Mastodon instance that doesn't come into a WordPress instance, posts from people you follow, some in response to posts you made. But there is a feed reader built into WordPress. And WordPress supports a very nice API so if you want to build on a different kind of feed management system (as I do) -- no problem, as long as it works on the web, they can connect. Again if we build on the web there are kinds of possibilities that don't exist if you build a monolithic all-in-one system like Mastodon." created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:55:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And then you might say that feed readers are slow because they poll, and people want to see messages instantly. And this is where I say there's a very well-debugged feature in WordPress that I helped them build in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/blog/2009/11/05/rsscloud-update/&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; that make feed updates instantaneous. Yeah Google tried to FUD it, as they did so much fuckery with feeds, but it it didn't actually accomplish anything. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_Cloud&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; is there, and it works, and it's absolutely instantaneous. Every WordPress site supports it as does FeedLand." created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:56:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I figure if we connect the dots, just building on open stuff (ie the web), with WordPress and FeedLand, hooked up to each other, it would more or less do what Mastodon does. It might still be apples and oranges, but on the web, you probably &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; hook an apple up to an orange and it would probably work the first time. ;-)" created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:57:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now there will be things one can do that the other can't, and it probably will go both ways, because this way of doing social networks works somewhat differently, but the cool thing is you can see ActivityPub starting to evolve toward RSS, so I think for the first time in a long time, a very long time, we will see some real motion in Social Media Land. There hasn't been any real competition in this space in a long time, and thus it has stagnated. But with a little competition, the minds should wake up and get to work meeting the challenge." created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:57:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One of my mottos: &quot;People don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors.&quot; It's still true today as it always has been. We are a species that is motivated to compete. It's deeply ingrained into who we are.  " created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:59:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PS: I love posts that pick up from where I started and move the ball in an interesting direction. This was one of the best things about the blogosphere of the past. It's nice to see that tradition being revived. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://passthejoe.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;. :-)" created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 15:00:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PPS: Someone should edit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_Cloud&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; about rssCloud. First they should format the name correctly. Second they say it was superceded by something the W3C did. I asked ChatGPT a straight question, did WebSub supercede rssCloud, and here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/341&quot;&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt;. Unequivocally false. Not only that the two protocols are very fundamentally different. " created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 15:12:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PPPS: This is one of the reasons I say Wikipedia has a much bigger trust issue than ChatGPT. It frequently transmits fake news or hallucinations like this, due to how it's edited. I expect to see lies on a Wikipedia page, and despite what you read about AIs, they're in my experience much more reliable. It's easy for a Wikipedia page to be hijacked by interested parties, as it was, no doubt, this time. For some reason the AIs seem to factor out the noise, somehow. Or maybe it's just that people haven't figured out how to spam it yet. " created="Thu, 27 Nov 2025 15:40:11 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I'm working today in the internals of FeedLand, specifically the code that determines if an item has changed. When we check a feed, we check each item, if the item already exists, we look at each of the values stored for the item compared with their new values in the feed, and if any have changed, we broadcast the message that the item has changed. I'm doing a complete review of this, based on actual data, and found there were a fair number of places we were calling a change, when nothing that mattered had changed. Now I'm debating whether or not a &lt;i&gt;pubDate&lt;/i&gt; change should be seen as an item change. My initial thought when we were working on RSS, was that the pubDate should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; change. In the real world of publishing I don't think the publication date changes. Right? Of course some feeds do change the pubDate because that's the &lt;i&gt;art of feeds&lt;/i&gt; (sorry for the sarcasm). But I don't think FeedLand should call that a change. Wondering what other feed developers do? So I asked ChatGPT. This is incredibly valuable &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/691f3cff-6998-8012-b505-8734bf11630f&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;.

I sent an email to Matt this morning suggesting that we promote the incredible connection between WordPress and Mastodon via ActivityPub. In the early days of the blogosphere we had the same problem, there was no good way to see who was writing, so we started a site called weblogs.com, which ping'd each site that we knew about to see if it had changed, if so it went to the top of a list that was published at &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. So if you wanted to find out what's new you'd just go there. It got more complicated over time, as the blogosphere grew at a very fast clip. We could do that for WordPress sites on ActivityPub by pointing to their site from a weblogs.com-like site.

It means we can build networks of feed sharing apps, no kidding -- it's going to do new things for us the same way RSS did new things for us 22 years ago. Now it can be fun when there are more FeedLand instances out there. It'd be more fun if they were products like Overcast or Pocket Casts.

				<outline text="Over the weekend I flipped the switch on a new app that makes my blog available on WordPress. It seems to work really well. The WordPress site is &quot;daveverse&quot;. And because it's on WordPress it is also available on ActivityPub, at @scripting@daveverse.org, which means you can read it on Mastodon. It doesn't feel weird at all to be reading a blog post on a social network. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3m5rlfrhgec2z&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky that we would love to have the same connection with their social network. It might happen sooner than you think. There are people developing writing tools for ATProto, but they're kind of stuck since Bluesky has all those limits that exclude the &lt;a href=&quot;https://writersweb.org/&quot;&gt;writer's web&lt;/a&gt;. It's so complicated, but out the other end, I hope will come a consensus that the social web should use more of the text features of the web. Further, the distributed nature of the web itself can form the backbone of distribution for the social web, that is if you think &quot;RSS&quot; is part of the web. When it's all said and done, we will realize that TBL got it right when he designed text with titles, subheads, styling, links, editing, no character limits, etc. He probably didn't even have to think about it much, considering he was basically replicating the standard document features from word processing apps of the 70s and 80s, without the printing. That's how evolution works, and the last 19 years of distortion by Twitter and those that followed them, will be seen as a weird transcription error (I hope).

					<outline text="So, my story --"/>
					<outline text="I started a bunch of things before coming to Berkman. Undergrad degree in math, masters in Computer Science, ran two software companies, was by some measure the first blogger, played a role in the bootstrap of RSS, and at Berkman we launched podcasting via the two BloggerCons we had there. "/>
					<outline text="I loved the reunion we had two summers ago, and think we should build on that. "/>
					<outline text="I got a very strong feeling from revisiting the campus that we should have kept going with the blogging we started at Berkman in 2003, and if we had done so, I think we'd be in a better position in social media today. We had a jump on Twitter, Facebook (which was also starting on campus at the same time). And we were doing everything with open protocols, all parts replaceable. Very different from the way the commercial networks are built. "/>
					<outline text="What I'm working on these days is primarily &quot;WordLand&quot;, where feeds and words get together using nothing but the open web, with all parts replaceable. " created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:50:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We use WordPress, via its REST API, as the platform for writing, we add a beautiful and simple new writer's toolkit, all in one place with all the administrative stuff out of the way. "/>
					<outline text="This product will also introduce an API that makes it easy for developers to create new editors because there are a lot of types of editors and people have their favorites. "/>
					<outline text="I'm working closely with the people of WordPress, gave a demo at WordCamp Canada a couple of weeks ago. I loved it, a lot of the energy of BloggerCon. I wish I had joined them years earlier. Their community has been growing for 20+ years. In tech that's a long time. "/>
					<outline text="It's also been about 20 years since we finished work on RSS 2.0, and that's the other major thing WordLand is built around. It's how messages fly around the net. Again totally replaceable parts. "/>
					<outline text="Berkman helped us with RSS 2.0, the official spec is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;cyber.harvard.edu&lt;/a&gt;, and hopefully will remain there as an artifact, a basis for interop, for perpetuity. Many thanks for the help here, it needed a permanent place to stay frozen, the tech industry very much wanted to take it apart. It's still going strong even though tech leaders and journalists have proclaimed it dead many many times. Wishful &lt;a href=&quot;https://isrssdead.com/&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt;, things like RSS don't die. :-)" created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:50:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I am committed to getting around the silos of the owners of social media, and making it possible for developers and users to build their own networks with their own rules, and not have to wait for corporate programmers to give them the tools, we need to be able to make them for ourselves. This btw to me has always been the ethos of Berkman, coming from Barlow and Nesson, it's the old idea that the web should set us free, not create new more entertaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster cages&lt;/a&gt; for us to play in to delight our masters.

					<outline text="These days I wonder how we can help Harvard do the things it's so good at that few people understand. People, esp young college-age people, should know there are ways to contribute beyond attaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;unusable wealth&lt;/a&gt;. I think what they want is a way to compete, to be great, to challenge themselves, and to win, and the money is secondary, a way to measure success. We can and should be creating new ways to measure the greatness of individual young people, directed towards more satisfying ends than making more money than they could possibly ever use. (And of course understanding that not all young people grow up to want to prove their worth, but the ones who vie to be the baddest billionaire have caused a lot of problems, and could use some alternate theories of how to be great. When I was young, I definitely was one of the ones with something to prove.)" created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:51:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway back to Harvard. It took forever for Harvard to admit publicity that podcasting incubated there. It did eventually come but only in passing, in an introduction at a 2008 conference, where I took a &lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2494080913/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the moment. Thanks to my friend John Palfrey for making this happen. " created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:52:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I believe that universities like Harvard should be constantly hosting the kind of work we were doing then, like a teaching hospital. It's not enough imho to study technology and leave the development of it to the industry. Then you get software designed by bankers. I want a continuing stream of innovation to come out of academia, with people returning to teach what they learned to students who came to get skills that will help them do good and make a good living, and then a few years later they come back, again and again. It should be a self-renewing process. "/>
					<outline text="I wrote about this several times over the last decade or so, I call this idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/phoenix/&quot;&gt;Developing Better Developers&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:52:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think the next best thing for now would be to have a homecoming for Berkman every two summers perhaps, where we get a chance to develop a pulse. And see where that goes. It's obviously a lot of work. The one we had brought back a lot of good ideas and friendships that we should still be working on together. "/>
					<outline text="I live in the Catskills btw, as you can tell from the subject line, just west of Kingston. Before that I spent nine years in Manhattan, before that Berkeley, Seattle, places like that. And Cambridge of course!  :-)"/>

It turned out I wasn't done. Heh. I think people like me never hang em up voluntarily. Who knows. ;-)" created="Mon, 03 Nov 2025 12:53:07 GMT"/>

I was pulling for the Blue Jays, dreading a Los Angeles win, but as they say you can't always get what you want.

				<outline text="In August 2002 I asked why RSS 1.0 is named RSS. I gathered up &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/whyRss10NamedRss&quot;&gt;opinions&lt;/a&gt; and published it as a single document. I didn't edit or respond, just let people speak. I think this is a legit document type. And when implemented in 2026, it should all work with pointers. They should be only one copy of the text, where the author wrote it. Technically this is totally doable. Just a few independent developers to work with to start a bootstrap. We know how to do this.

BTW, well-kept secret, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that takes one of these outlines and publishes it to the web, in the format you see on &quot;Scripting News&quot;.

It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt; and I wrote it in 2017 because I wanted my old blog back, I was fed up with trying to fit into the very small world defined by Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook and Medium. I decided then the cost was too high, and I'd be much happier if I lived within the limits of &quot;RSS&quot;, which is far better than the text formats defined by these other projects.

				<outline text="I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2025/10/29/184306.html#a184449&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; about Philippe Kahn the other day, and just remembered -- I forgot to write about &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Turbo%20Pascal%22&quot;&gt;Turbo Pascal&lt;/a&gt;. I had been using program compilers for C and Pascal for almost a decade when it came out, and it was shockingly different in a good way. Somehow it could compile a whole program in less than a second. Years before I had developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=ThinkTank&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; on the Apple II and IBM PC using Pascal, and it often took &lt;i&gt;minutes&lt;/i&gt; to do the same thing! This changed languages in a great way -- later I would switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22think%20c%22&quot;&gt;Think C&lt;/a&gt; that had the same instant compiling. There were other great things about Turbo Pascal, because the editor was integrated, so you could start that compilation with a single keystroke. He understood that the quicker this was, the more in a groove the developer could get. Imagine if you had to wait a minute before you could read the prose you just wrote? It used to be like that. Going back to the 70s it would sometimes take many minutes, and you could run out of time, and wouldn't be able to change the software until they added more money to your account. Like the horse and buggy days. How far we've come. " created="Sat, 01 Nov 2025 15:02:30 GMT" type="outline"/>
