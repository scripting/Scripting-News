There was a surprise, he didn't watch the NBA bubble last year. I didn't either. It was too sad. The NBA now, finally, is back. And having the Knicks do so well this year, and it being the immediate post-pandemic season, it's like both happened at the same time and one was the cause and the other was the effect, though it's impossible to say which is which.

					<outline text="I haven't worked inside a company in a long time, but I imagine the problem is bad there too. And within my communities, many people don't understand why all the bugs don't disappear at once. Or why I made the software do something they don't like. Because they don't see a process. How can you blame them, even if they were here with me, all they would see is someone typing at a keyboard, going for walks, hanging out. How that turns into functionality, they don't even know that it does turn into functionality."/>
					<outline text="I remember a lot of the gestalts when I was learning how to develop software initially. And I was a student of this stuff, getting an advanced degree.

				<outline text="I had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; this morning. There was only twelve minutes of MRI'ing, but I swore to myself next time I'd rather die than do this again. It's weird. I know I'll forget that eventually, I did last time (it was worse than today's).  It was broken into 5 separate exposures of different lengths. I tried various ways to keep my mind occupied. First, I counted all the states, first going around the edge of the country then looping through the interior. The second time I did it again. Next time I tried counting my breaths, but eventually lost interest. All the time I'm having bouts of freaking out from claustrophobia. I thought &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; thoughts. All the while it felt like the MRI was pulling me in, even though the operator told me that was just an illusion. But, by the last segment I figured out what to do. I reviewed the code in the project I'm working on now. I realized I had a great map of it memorized, and walked through all the bits I could remember, like the states, just to see how much I could find up there in my brain. My brain is a tool for thought, I realized, and tried not to laugh. It kept me entertained. I'm passing this along as a lifehack for programmers, or other designers and developers.

				<outline text="Up for discussion, using Markdown as an outline interchange format. First, my outliners will support it if it gains traction. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/roamhacker/a615a1b2e83d79853b3cc40c9e0f3494/raw/a3d8ea783a0073555dd19f0f543a0c8d0ce4cce5/Logseq%2520Markdown%2520exammple%2520for%2520DW.md&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. Comments follow. Markdown is good for what it was designed to do, to be a simple alternative to HTML. You could send someone an email in Markdown, and they wouldn't have a clue that it was also something a piece of software could turn into a decent web page. I like Markdown for appropriate uses. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+facebook+markdown&quot;&gt;urging Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to support Markdown so that their posts could have simple styling and links. But is it useful as an interchange format for outlines? Outlines can have attributes attached at any node, and this is something that Markdown can't handle without being extended, and it's questionable whether Markdown can be updated. Further if you start adding technical stuff to Markdown, it stops fulfilling its mission to be human readable. But as I said, I'm not picky, if it becomes popular I'll support it. What do I like for outline interchange? OPML, of course. That's what it was designed for, and it works. I wouldn't mind if we used a JSONified OPML, it's easy to go back and forth between XML and JSON (they're really the same thing, actually). For more information see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; I put together for devs supporting OPML in their outline-processing software" created="Thu, 27 May 2021 10:52:40 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/02/lbj.png"/>

				<outline text="A bike safety idea. I noticed on my ride yesterday, a very nice day, in the week before Memorial Day, so lots of city folk are around, and they're out for a walk, in groups of 2 to 8 on the same roads I ride my bike on. They often occupy all the space, and move around a lot so it's impossible to know where I can safely go to get by them. I'm sure if I hit them they would get hurt, but unlike a car, I would get just as hurt. And I don't make much noise, so maybe they don't even hear me. I noticed that when a car approaches they get out of the way, presumably because 1. They can hear the car and 2. They know they'd get hurt and the car driver would just get a ticket, if that. I get a lot of thinking done while I ride, and I came up with a potential solution. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Micro-Bluetooth-Speaker-Waterproof/dp/B07VSPPQXC/ref=asc_df_B07VSPPQXC/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=416694489735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16093003404928166045&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-936549499154&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=94693386915&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=416694489735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16093003404928166045&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-936549499154&quot;&gt;great little speaker&lt;/a&gt; mounted on my handlebar. It's small but it produces a lot of sound. What if, as I was approaching a group of such people, I switched the sound to that of an accelerating car, headed straight for them.

Same with Marjorie Three Names (a term coined by Silverberg). That they are tolerated by Repubs is news, but not super important. What matters is why aren't we actively trying to head off the looming permanent hijacking of American democracy? Why are our news channels content in reporting the points on the curve instead of the curve itself. When the 2022 election comes and the Repubs take over the House, then, when it is too late, will they report on how the next presidential election is meaningless because the Republican House will never let the election stand, if the Republican candidate should lose. That Democrats will never win another election. Whose fault will it be when it's too late? We have an incredible chance right now to get ahead of the history that the Repubs are trying to write.

					<outline text="But there are other views of this world. Outlines are great structures for programming! Python started off in that direction, but stopped before they got to the good stuff imho.

					<outline text="But, even that's just the beginning. Something I haven't seen explored in any of the TFT products is the idea of an outline as a file system.

					<outline text="Again, I'm aware that this could come off as arrogant. But what do you do when a group of brilliant young visionaries discover what you discovered when you were one of them, in the mid 1970s, and spent the rest of your career exploring and developing, while the rest of the computer world pretty much ignored you? First you celebrate! It's not a lost cause after all. Then you ask yourself as I am, how do you approach this. What I've decided so far is that I am going to continue to develop &quot;Drummer&quot;, and I'm going to push in every way for zero lock-in, user choice everywhere, and clean simple and extensible APIs for each of the components. And of course I will be writing all through this process, as long as I can, because that's the other thing I do -- blog.

This seems to be happening on Twitter now. I'm going to keep readers of the blog in the loop. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1395632868035121156&quot;&gt;Latest question&lt;/a&gt; -- what to do when the user presses the Return key. Here's how &quot;LO2&quot; does it. If the cursor headline has expanded subs, then the new headline is the new first sub. If the cursor head has no subs or they aren’t expanded, it is the next sibling. It doesn't matter which mode you're in, structure or text, the behavior is the same. The Return key is too important to have multiple meanings. It always creates a new headline. BTW, LO2 works the same way ThinkTank, MORE, Ready, Frontier, the OPML Editor all work(ed). Once we had these questions sorted out, we kept the functionality consistent. Some things have evolved over time, for example the wedges are relatively new, earlier outliners had two leaders, a plus, indicating that the headline has subs, and a minus, indicating it has no subs. But the wedges are more expressive. They tell you whether there is unexpanded material underneath (the wedge is black) or not (it's gray). So it's easy to scan to see where there might be hidden structure. " created="Fri, 21 May 2021 14:17:10 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/07/23/frontierBox.png"/>
				<outline text="BTW, I call it the Return key, but on my keyboard it says Enter. This is to distinguish it from the other Enter key, usually along the right edge of the keyboard, near the numeric keypad if the keyboard has one. That one we reserve for a different function, it's the keyboard method for switching between text and structure mode. " created="Fri, 21 May 2021 14:25:59 GMT" type="outline"/>

Even the headline of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/undead-again-google-brings-back-rss/amp/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch article&lt;/a&gt; is disturbing. Google did so much damage to &quot;RSS&quot;, the thought of them &quot;reviving&quot; it is analogous to Exxon reviving the site of some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfund&quot;&gt;huge oil spill&lt;/a&gt;, one that they didn't contribute to cleaning up. Even worse, browser vendors have no place trying to provide the user interface for RSS. Another toxic dump site. If Google wants to help RSS, great -- here's how. Do the subscribe button, that's a good thing. But the result should be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/15/feedReaderDevs&quot;&gt;dynamic OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt;, that the user can provide to any reader app they want. It's dynamic in that the contents can change, and the readers should periodically check to see if feeds have been added or removed. This way, if someday Google abandons RSS, again, everything can keep on ticking, more or less. Inviting users to rely on them shows that they have no sense of responsibility for the trust they betrayed in the past. Perhaps users can refuse to go on this ride? That might be too much to hope for.

Imho, the only reason to keep the NYT around is to tell us the truth about what's really going on. Well, firing McNeil was something we never did hear the truth about. And I'm not forgetting it.

But what they did, in removing the mask mandate, is as bad imho as anything Trump did. Back then he could telegraph his disagreement, but apparently he can no longer do that. &lt;i&gt;People are going to die&lt;/i&gt; because of what they did, possibly many people. We're throwing away the advantage we got from the vaccine. How do I know?

Last night the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/knicks-clinch-playoff-berth-first-021855101.html&quot;&gt;Knicks clinched&lt;/a&gt; a spot in the NBA playoffs. Tears are streaming down my sad old face as I write this. The first playoff year since 2012-13, the season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1747434-timeline-of-jeremy-lins-rise-to-linsanity-and-journey-to-where-he-is-today&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;.

So the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Yb0HCTe1ET4?t=30&quot;&gt;paper bags&lt;/a&gt; come off our heads, at least for a while. We're no long staring into space wondering how a team could possibly suck as bad as the Knicks. Fans being kicked out of the Garden by the owner for telling the truth about him and his stinkin team. Phil Jackson, his triangle offense and all the lousy trades. This was the year the superstars of the NBA spit on the Knicks and went to Brooklyn. There must be a Basketball God who looked at this and said, my dear friends, fate is not in the hands of KD, Kyrie and Harden. I am the master of fate. The Knicks believed in themselves and we came to believe in them, however tentatively. And meanwhile, thankfully, Melo, playing in Portland, seems happy in his new role. For one day in May, pandemic or not, all is good because god loves us and we love the Knicks. " created="Thu, 13 May 2021 11:50:59 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png"/>

But I got it wrong. They are simpler than I thought, and represent a feature we had in our web CMSes going back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatdoesclaylooklike.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in 1995.

					<outline text="It's useful if you give titles to what you write, but this is an old discussion not just in blogland but elsewhere apparently. To programmers it is convenient if every piece has a title. But the truth is most items in web and personal writing don't have titles, in this sense: there isn't an obvious title for them, if you had to come up with one it would be convoluted, and probably collide with some other convoluted title, depending on how long you had been writing. " created="Thu, 13 May 2021 12:49:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Most of the things I write don't get titles, so this feature, with this definition, would be fairly useless to me.

					<outline text="I see how they get around this in Roam by starting a new outline every day, and giving it a title, which is the date. I could do that in my blogging outline, and even in my development status outline. But I have to say I've never wished for such a feature. Maybe now that I know they use them so much in other products I'll get more ideas. " created="Thu, 13 May 2021 12:51:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the meantime, I automatically put a &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; attribute on every node, which is a string representation of the date-time, for example: Thu, 13 May 2021 16:41:07 GMT. From that I generate a permalink for the node, which is displayed next to it in the web rendering by a purple poundsign.

					<outline text="Our outlines have attributes, and conventions for what the attribute names mean. For example, if a node has type &quot;include&quot; and a &quot;url&quot; attribute, that's an include node. The url points to an OPML file. When you expand the node in an outline, we read the file, parse it, and insert its contents under the include node. All that happens instantaneously for not-too-large included outlines. Some people call these transclusions, we call them includes. It's the outline equivalent of an HTML link. In Drummer it will be possible to have these link to specific nodes in outlines.

I'm happy to share what I've learned, and I think all of it is applicable to the connected world we live in.

					<outline text="There are also big differences in the way our outliners work. I could explain that in a podcast, but don't have the time to write it up now. The takeaway is that without open modular connections between the components via APIs, this new burst of outlineism will end up with a sad story of silos and stagnation, not a wonderful explosion like the earlier open platforms. One silo vs a thriving ecosystem -- either approach could win. It's happened both ways in the past. We have to be careful to learn from past mistakes in evolving open platforms.

He said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sabre23t/status/1392115762358276097&quot;&gt;he expected&lt;/a&gt; that putting a word inside two &amp;lsqb;[square brackets]] would open a page full of links to that word within my outline. This is a very important point, and one I want to focus on. I actually put that feature into the outliner I currently use to write my blog, when I saw how they were doing things in &amp;lsqb;[Roam]] and &amp;lsqb;[wikis]]. I will ship that for sure, it's a good thing, I'm using it myself. But! It would be so much better if all these tools worked together in an open web of these things. That's the way I think about it. Remember, I led the development of &amp;lsqb;[RSS]] in its early years. I always wanted outlines to be &lt;i&gt;world&lt;/i&gt; outlines, ie to include content from other outlines all over the web. I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+%22world+outline%22&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; a lot about that. In that context, I should be integrating with a &lt;i&gt;world wide&lt;/i&gt; service that integrates lots of tools into a database of linked material. Roam insists that you use their editor, which is abhorrent to me, I will never support that, where Obsidian takes the open web approach. So the question I throw back to SMS and others is how can we set things up so a &amp;lsqb;[bracketed]] reference works with the &lt;i&gt;world wide link manager.&lt;/i&gt; We can do this. The technology is totally here. It sounds like &amp;lsqb;[Obsidian]] is off to a good start.

A few Obsidian users had got Logseq to work with Obsidian on the same folder.&quot; Lots of new terms in that sentence. He posted a pointer to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.obsidian.md/t/logseq-a-perfect-companion-for-obsidian/10887&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is something like Roam, but it's an open system, where Roam is a silo with lots of lock-in. So we like Obsidian over Roam, instantly -- simply because our tools (yours and mine) have a chance of participating, where Roam, well we can use their outliner, and get locked-in, which I don't see happening any time soon. &quot;LO2&quot; is where we start. Since outlines are in an easily used and open format dating back over 20 years, and can be made accessible to any web-able app (by making them public), it should be possible to &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt; hook it up to Obsidian or any similarly open platform. This is a good place to start. Now, this has to be a community thing, because I'm busy working on a new product, and don't want to detour. And that's why we support open formats and protocols, so there are no limits on what users and devs can do.

Very top down. Center of the universe, only this isn't a good image to project to voters. They want to feel feel understood, which is weird because the candidate is doing the talking.

They do well at the top of academia, but don’t have a popular touch, and I’m being generous. Certainly there was some sexism, people who wouldn't vote for a woman under any circumstances, but she became the frontrunner with everyone aware of her gender. A woman candidate could have won the nomination in my opinion, someone like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; or Michigan governor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer&quot;&gt;Gretchen Whitmer&lt;/a&gt;. It's ridiculous to conclude that a woman couldn't get the nomination, esp since the Democratic nominee in 2016 was a woman. If Warren wants to be president she's going to have to listen to people outside her bubble. People who will, as they say, speak truth to power.

If my development work ever was about prowess, that part of my life is long-gone. It's something young people worry about. Perhaps a residual part of the mating dance. As you get older, you're constantly reminded that you have no prowess. And gentler things, like appreciating other people's artistic visions, come to the front. So why do Art Show?

A better approach, imho, is to do things that please you, and others. Be kind. Help people. And whatever is left behind, incidentally, from that all that, is what you leave behind. Don't consciously try to change the world. Just do your thing. I'm not perfect about this. I would like to see what I've written, both in software and prose, survive me.

I knew &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=guy+kawasaki+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;Guy&lt;/a&gt; when he was chief evangelist at Apple in the early days of the Mac. I was a software developer. He always treated me with respect. He worked for developers as much as he worked for Apple. I remember watching him talk with a developer who was kind of lost, and I was blown away how Guy treated him like a customer. I wonder if Steve Jobs knew how much care he put into his work. He was also one of the most passionate users of my early outliners. I wanted him to know that podcasting was developed the same way the early Mac products we worked on were. A core idea, an audio blog post. Trial and error. See what works. When something does work, do more of it, until four years after we started it, it took off. That so many years later, Guy is loving podcasting, that is so gratifying to me, that someone who connected to my earliest successes in tech, is flourishing with one of my more recent successes. That's how I came to get on his calendar to be interviewed next week. I'd like to talk with him as a developer and a user, I want to learn from his point of view how the product (podcasting) has helped him create. I'm sure we'll talk about why I keep doing this, iterating over new software ideas, over so many decades. That, right there is it.

That's the chicken that's waiting for the egg, etc. It's possible that Twitter can make the difference, the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/martinLeavesTheTimes.html&quot;&gt;NYT made the difference for RSS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;.

It would be better imho if the NYT had bought Scroll and put its subscription function behind it. Would have also made sense for the Washington Post to do it, esp with Bezos as the owner. No question Amazon would know how to monetize this so as to eliminate the stifling ideas of paywalls and subscriptions. But Twitter is what we got.

					<outline text="The first was about political discussions at work. The issue was raised by the recent controversy at the Basecamp company, which had suspended political discussions on the company's internal message boards. Later it came out that they were getting criticism for an internal list they kept of customers with &quot;funny&quot; names.

I understand that blacks use the n-word as a term of endearment for each other and it's not something white people are entitled to an opinion about, according to Coates. Whatever he says, we can have opinions about whatever we want, as he has negative opinions about white people, and expresses them. At 3:23 he makes a generalization which I found offensive. I don't think I own everything. Further I don't &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to use the n-word, and further, please don't use that word to refer to me. Thanks.  " created="Tue, 04 May 2021 13:26:20 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I wrote yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1388485567348985860&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that journalism does not cover the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=How+many+people+use+Facebook&quot;&gt;2.8 billion people&lt;/a&gt; who use Facebook. Imagine a country with that many people with no journalism. A blind spot, imho. A potentially costly one for all of us, our journalism should be facing in that direction more, imho. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/taylor-lorenz&quot;&gt;NYT reporter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz&quot;&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://taylorlorenz.substack.com/&quot;&gt;covers&lt;/a&gt; Facebook and Instagram and other online media (I think it's all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+silo&quot;&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; services, no open platforms) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1388487842360266758&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; with classic reporter reasoning, the same line I've been hearing since I took an interest in journalism in the mid-90s. After a few back and forths, I sent a DM saying I'd be happy to continue in a voice chat, was surprised when she sent back her number. I called and we talked for about an hour. It was a fast and interesting conversation with a talented and observant young (from my pov of course) person. She got her start as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://taylorlorenz.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr blogger&lt;/a&gt; believe it or not. She might be the only person in the world actually covering those 2.8 billion people. We talked about the NYT today, I talked a bit about tech reporting at the Times in the past, told stories of the old days in the Valley, it was refreshing. Memorable.  I'm going to read her more carefully now. BTW, I dropped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+markoff&quot;&gt;Markoff's&lt;/a&gt; name a couple of times, later I wondered if she knew who he is (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-markoff&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt; star tech &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Markoff&quot;&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt; as the web was starting up). I realize we are deep into the next generations of tech journalism, now. Also imho TL should have a podcast, I said a couple of times. A book first, then a podcast.

There was a brief period when I was involved with the standards groups, but mostly it turns out, it was to either transfer the power to evolve the formats and protocols without my further involvement with SOAP, or to fail to convince them to go with &quot;RSS&quot;. Instead they tried to overtake RSS with another format, it failed, as I tried to tell them it would. Many years later, I hear there's a kind of reverence for RSS, its strength is amazing to them. But why should it be any less resilient than say HTML? Both are proof that the market creates these things, not the big tech companies. Honesly most of what they do in my experience is &lt;i&gt;destructive&lt;/i&gt; to standards. Anyway if we're into interop now, maybe there's something more to be done here. I have three formats I am caring for -- OPML, XML-RPC and of course RSS. " created="Sun, 02 May 2021 13:54:43 GMT" type="outline"/>

It's the kind of story &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO&quot;&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; excels at, they have a deep library of shows like this, many of which I've never seen. Unfortunately &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarnerMedia&quot;&gt;HBO's owners&lt;/a&gt; decided that this unique library doesn't deserve to stand alone. They used its name to host a cheap Netflix clone called HBO Max, and filled it with crap, among which the HBO gems are buried. Sorry I know some people like superhero movies, I used to, but there's a glut and they're all the same, I can't watch any of them. I just want a simple interface for the HBO library. I guess the message is that HBO had no future, so let's just use what goodwill remains to throw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass&quot;&gt;Hail Mary pass&lt;/a&gt; at Netflix.

Seems to be catching on. My Node app reads those accounts periodically and downloads the images into a local folder, which I then point my Mac screen saver at. I have it running on a Mac Mini hooked up to my 65 inch screen in the living room. The result? Art show! I love this stuff. I'm going to hook the app up to a GitHub repo, so people can sync to that. We have such a wealth of art, and huge numbers of screens and good networks. Why not use them this way? The art is sooo beautful. Makes me happy.
