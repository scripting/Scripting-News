			<outline text="Greetings!"/>
			<outline text="I have been asked to forward this to my industry friends, which I do with total enthusiasm."/>
			<outline text="Come see Marc Canter do it again -- that is, revolutionize the multimedia industry -- with his new vision of things to come. "/>
			<outline text="It's Meet The Media Band -- Marc's first interactive multimedia CD-ROM -- to be launched this Tuesday, Oct. 11, at 6:30PM at Moscone Center (after the first day of Multimedia Expo). Hobnob with all of Marc's friends (and enemies!), and join us in a dinner afterwards at the Cadillac, across from the Moscone Center near Fourth and Howard."/>
			<outline text="I'd only add that Marc has promised that he will sing at both events."/>
			<outline text="Be there!!!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Please forward this email to anyone you think might be interested (or outraged!)."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/12/94; 9:38:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hi!"/>
			<outline text="Marc Canter's rollout last nite was great. About 300 people attended. Marc sang. Great stuff, great press kit."/>
			<outline text="From the press kit -- Marc's &quot;10 Things&quot; -- which follows, provides a list of 10 things that the media should be covering on Multimedia and Interactive TV but isn't. It's Marc's piece, if you have comments, please send them to D0010@APPLELINK.APPLE.COM. I wouldn't mind if you cc'd me on them."/>
			<outline text="Also: this letter is being automatically distributed to about 1000 people, chosen from my rolodex, from various conference attendee lists, and by reference. It's an experiment in electronic PR. If you aren't interested in this kind of stuff, send me an email and I'll happily delete your name from the list. BTW, it's coming via AppleLink because it's the only scriptable email service. I understand that it isn't fashionable to be on AppleLink these days, so look for a change here soon! (Go get 'em Apple, please!)"/>
			<outline text="So without any further ado, here are Marc's 10 Things..."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Interactive Music Videos"/>
			<outline text="1. Interactive Liner notes are great. Repackaged old music is fine, but MediaBand has started a new category - called Interactive Music Videos - which are original pieces that combine songs, music videos and videogames. It's a new artform that breaks down the barrier between artist, musician and programmer."/>
			<outline text="***Kid's Content"/>
			<outline text="2. Kids today see the twitchy-ness of Nintendo and they see the production values of MTV. Multimedia today is neither. We need to combine the interactivity of Nintendo with the production values of MTV."/>
			<outline text="***CD ROMs"/>
			<outline text="3. We didn't call it a floppy disk industry, so how come it's a CD ROM industry?  In fact CD ROM is holding back the creativity and growth of the entire interactive digital media industry."/>
			<outline text="***Scalable Content"/>
			<outline text="4. Scalable content is an important concept when developing interactive media today. You don't want to design yourself into a corner, letting the technology define the content. Ideally you'd let the content define the technology. Scalability means downsizing through compression, it means user interfaces that work with both single and multiple users, it means getting ready for Interactive TV."/>
			<outline text="***Audio"/>
			<outline text="5. The classic line is &quot;Audio is the orphan child of multimedia&quot; - why do people still say this?  What is behind the hodge-podge of audio - especially on the PC?  How come it's taken so long for manufacturers to include audio on their motherboards?  In 1984 it was $3 in parts!"/>
			<outline text="***MIDI II?"/>
			<outline text="6. What about MIDI?  How many people know what that is?  Why isn't there an advanced MIDI format in place?  The original MIDI frequency standard (32k) is based a 1Mhz crystal readily available in 1982.But what's the problem today?  Why hasn't MIDI evolved and grown?"/>
			<outline text="***RAM"/>
			<outline text="7. RAM apparently is not following along the path of Moore's Law. The price is still where it was 5 years ago and systems are suffering. Today MPC II is still speced at only 4M - MediaBand needs 8M. Standard business systems should have at least 16M TODAY!  "/>
			<outline text="***Set top tests waste of time?"/>
			<outline text="8. The whole industry hopped when John Malone announced he was going to deploy one million set top boxes with MPEG chips in them. Once it became clear that he was practicing FUD, everyone backed off of their predictions, delayed their test trials and are now waiting for the next thing to react to.The tests going on (or planned to start soon) are not based upon the same technology or even marketing premises. What good will these tests do?  Will any of these tests actually grow into a  real service network."/>
			<outline text="***Interactive Commercials"/>
			<outline text="9. What exactly is an Interactive TV commercial. Lots of people talk about it, but no one does them."/>
			<outline text="***Support?"/>
			<outline text="10. Where's the support? As the industry moves towards 900 # support and low priced consumer software, what happens to support? Dealers obviously can't supply it. Is this a new growth market?"/>

		<outline text="Letter to Cannavino" created="10/13/1994;  7:33:00 AM">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Letter to Cannavino&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/13/94; 7:33:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Greetings! "/>
			<outline text="Now I'd like to switch gears from Marc's vision of the future of multimedia, interactive TV, etc, to the quagmire that Apple and IBM are in, and how they might help each other, and at the same time help us -- software developers and investors. And give the editors and analysts even more controversial things to speculate about."/>
			<outline text="Background: At Agenda 95 a few weeks ago, Jim Cannavino, IBM's top strategy exec was doing yet another demo of OS/2, this time as a souped-up Internet client. This thought formed in my head -- WHY???? -- doesn't he get it? We don't care anymore, we've all decided OS/2 is a dead-end. Nothing he could say could get us to invest."/>
			<outline text="A question formed in my head. Why aren't they betting on the only platform around that has a chance against Windows -- the Macintosh OS? So I took a deep breath, said to myself &quot;fear is frozen fun&quot; -- let's have some fun!"/>
			<outline text="So I got up and asked Jim a question: why don't you chuck OS/2 and get together with Apple and promote Macintosh as the other desktop standard?"/>
			<outline text="It got quite a reaction, both at the conference and via email afterwards. Along the way, I wrote a letter to Jim, and cc'd it to a bunch of other people, including Apple execs. I wanted to share that memo with this group, so here it is..."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Jim:"/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I'm the guy who asked about OS/2 in the opening session at Agenda 95 a couple of weeks ago."/>
			<outline text="I've done some more thinking about where the Mac OS is at relative to OS/2."/>
			<outline text="A football analogy: the Mac is at fourth and very long yardage, but they're on the 30-yard line. OS/2 is at second and 10, but you're 90 yards from the goal."/>
			<outline text="There's a huge investment in Mac OS-compatible source code, and a lot of know-how out there. But that investment is a long-shot now because the world sees Windows as the only viable platform."/>
			<outline text="You're just getting started building a developer base around OS/2. You have a very long way to go before it equals the Mac base.  Given the momentum behind Windows, I believe you will never get to the point that the Mac is at right now."/>
			<outline text="If one of your goals is to recapture momentum with developers, if you and Apple joined to back the Mac OS exactly as it is now at System 7.5 level, (forget Taligent and OpenDoc) you could get a lot of extra development resources behind IBM. From there, you'd have to manage the platform very carefully to build momentum."/>
			<outline text="The industry *really* doesn't want to back Microsoft exclusively. I was a lightning-rod for this idea at Agenda, since I asked you that pointed question."/>
			<outline text="A combination of Apple relinquishing control of the Mac OS and IBM capitulating on OS/2 would be very welcome, and if you were smart and patient, and listened to developers, you'd get back in front."/>
			<outline text="I'm not saying you can or should chuck OS/2. But if you took over the Mac OS, and got out of developers' way (Apple has always been in our face) and made a commitment to stay with it I believe it has a pretty good chance of working."/>
			<outline text="Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Do *you* have any comments. Agree or disagree? Is it hopeless? Would you invest in a carefully managed Mac platform with IBM's backing? Do you care? "/>
			<outline text="If there are enough comments, I'll collate them and redistribute them to the list. And as always, if you aren't interested in this kind of stuff, send me email and I'll happily delete your name from the list. "/>
			<outline text="Have fun!"/>

		<outline text="How to invest in PDAs" created="10/14/1994;  12:01:00 PM">
			<outline text="#title &quot;How to invest in PDAs&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/14/94; 12:01:00 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Greetings!"/>
			<outline text="Next stop on the hit parade of hot topics in the software industry: PDAs and what's going on there, how will it shake out, and where investment dollars should go in search of the mobile user for 1994 and 1995."/>
			<outline text="First, a PDA is a peripheral device for people with desktop computers. A way of carrying around your appointment calendar, address book, and to receive news from home. "/>
			<outline text="I think any entry in this market has to have a very tight connection with desktop computers. Newton and General Magic seem to believe that the PDAs are useful *without* a strong link to desktop systems. Fatal flaw."/>
			<outline text="What about the PDA form factor? Because the keyboard situation is so awkward, and there's no solution in sight, I don't see them as input devices. Using a PDA to write email is like using a ski pole to dig a trench. If you're an email writer who travels, the only answer is to carry a *real* keyboard with you, not a virtual one as seen in Magic Cap. And as long as you're carrying a real keyboard, why not carry a screen that's big enough? And backlit? And while you're at it, why not carry an industry standard OS with you, like Windows or Mac?"/>
			<outline text="I thought WinPad had it exactly right. But it seems that Microsoft has cold feet, or is dragging its feet, or is waiting for someone to dip in their toe first. Maybe they're waiting to kick off their new online service? Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="Interesting observation -- now that Microsoft owns Intuit, they also own software that's bundled with Magic Cap. Straaaaange bedfellows, eh?"/>
			<outline text="Anyway -- if you're an investor or developer and want to put a bet down on really mobile computing -- what should you do?  ">
				<outline text="1. Write client software for Windows and Mac, "/>
				<outline text="2. Write server software for Novell, DOS, Unix, NT and/or Mac, and "/>
				<outline text="3. Hope that Microsoft gets off its butt and ships WinPad, or "/>
				<outline text="4. Hope that Apple (or whoever owns them next week) sees the sense of">
					<outline text="scaling down the Mac OS to fit into a PDA form factor. "/>
					</outline>
				</outline>
			<outline text="As always, if you aren't interested in this kind of stuff, send me email and I'll happily delete your name from the list. And it's OK to forward this email anywhere you like. "/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Randy Battat on PDAs&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/16/94; 5:48:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Randy Battat, Motorola's executive in charge of mobile computing, has comments on my &quot;How to Invest in PDAs&quot; piece. It's Randy's piece, if you have comments, please send them to battat@wes.mot.com. I wouldn't mind if you cc'd me on them at dwiner@well.com."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Dave et. al,"/>
			<outline text="I fear that the first premise, that PDAs are peripherals to PCs, is a bit short-sighted. "/>
			<outline text="True, today's PDA's haven't been successful, but I think that some in this space eventually will be. PCs simply can't scale to be very small, personal devices that people will want to carry on their person all the time. Therefore, there's room for a new class of device -- hence the PDA."/>
			<outline text="But thinking of PDAs as PC peripherals is the same as thinking of PCs as minicomputer peripherals. Yes, PCs were used in this way in the early days. But that context hid a much deeper understanding of the role of the PC, and its social, economic, educational, scientific, etc. implications."/>
			<outline text="Today's PDAs are like the Altair's and Commodore Pet's and Tandy TRS-80's of 15 years ago. These early PCs were very different than the Macs and Windows machines we take for granted today (or in '95 for the latter!). I would argue that the Newtons and MagicLinks of today will scarcely resemble that which they inspire in the years to come."/>
			<outline text="And, just as PCs were very different in every way from their minicomputer predecessors -- shrink-wrapped vs. custom software, retail vs. direct distribution, 20% gross margins vs. 70% gross margins -- thinking of PDAs in PC metrics will cloud our view of what may really transpire."/>
			<outline text="Not that I'm a PDA biggot. I see myself using PCs for some things and PDAs for others. The current crop of PDAs are exciting but barely usable. But AppleWriter and VisiCalc and SilentType printers were similarly &quot;unfinished&quot; in their day."/>
			<outline text="Give it time. Keep the short term expectations tempered. But don't be constrained by the artifacts of the day."/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Judging from the mail, people seem to be much more interested in PDAs than IBM's and Apple's operating system conundrum."/>
			<outline text="[At the last minute, Roger McNamee from Kleiner-Perkins said: Nothing disappoints me more than Apple's inability to articulate the message that its products are better.  I just put a Windows machine on my office desk for the first time ever. What a nightmare! In two months, our tech consultant has put more time into making that box run with a fairly diverse spread of software than he put into an entire network of Macs over the prior year.  The thing is, I can't imagine doing anything important on a Windows machine.]"/>

			<outline text="***Jean-Louis Gassee, Be Inc, gassee@applelink.apple.com, a Psion 3a user"/>
			<outline text="Once you own and operate a competent PDA, it becomes a lot more than a PC peripheral. I carry my PDA everywhere, not my notebook."/>
			<outline text="I like the small size and I miss some communication functions, but I can connect my PDA to my Mac, do drag-and-drop transfers between volumes on the network and the PDA. My PDA has printer drivers for HP compatibles and LaserWriters and will print directly connected, or on the network, or to file."/>
			<outline text="The MagicLink looks interesting, but it's way too big for me to carry it with me. It must fit in a suit pocket."/>
			<outline text="***Bobby Orbach, Orbach Inc, 577-7433@mcimail.com"/>
			<outline text="When a PDA becomes as useful as a cellular phone or a Gameboy, then the world will embrace the technology. We don't buy technology because it's cool, we buy it for its usefulness or because it's fun."/>
			<outline text="***Gary Pearce, Steam Radio, uk0001@applelink.apple.com"/>
			<outline text="It is perfectly possible to use the limited handwriting recognition to compose and reply to email provided the s/w is written in accordance with the abilities. Sadly little is. Developers were jollied along in the belief that the internal handwriting recognition was the answer to the maidens prayer. This was because, by current computer industry standards it is _very good_. This is akin to current toaster industry standards where the latest cooking controls are _very good_. My toaster still burns the second slice every time and it annoys me."/>
			<outline text="I think the Online Services thang deserves a topic for itself. There are some very strange things going on there."/>
			<outline text="It is possible to take Newton technology and produce a true PDA. I would urge you to look at the Isaac project conducted by Dr Lars Philipson at the Univ of Lund in Sweden, lars@dit.lth.se."/>
			<outline text="***Amy Wohl, 499-0884@mcimail.com"/>
			<outline text="I think I agree with Randy.  A PDA isn't a PC and shouldn't be.  Today's PDA's are just early attempts to think about what would be useful, highly constrained by what we're familiar with and not at all brave or radical enough. I think I'm going to return to science fiction to think about what I want a PDA to look like and do."/>
			<outline text="***Michael Markman, Apple, markman1@applelink.apple.com"/>
			<outline text="Randy, on this issue, I think that you and Dave are both right. Although, I believe Dave is considerably more right than you are."/>
			<outline text="The fallacy of your point-of-view is this: PCs first appealed to people who wanted, but couldnÕt get direct or dedicated access to mainframe or mini time. (I want my OWN computer, dammit.) Over time, they also appealed to people who had no idea that a computer could be useful on a personal basis. PCs sold to people who were not in a position to purchase their own mainframes or mini-computers."/>
			<outline text="Now and for quite sometime, the buyers of PDAs will be the early adopter, gadget-freak segment of the PC installed base. A PDA isn't sold to someone who can't get time on a PC. It's sold to someone who won't lug his PC (or even his notebook PC) everywhere."/>
			<outline text="Peripheral may be a loaded word. If 'partner' better serves the egos of people involved in developing and marketing PDAs, then fine."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/18/94; 9:59:47 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I sat down to write some code this morning, but I'm having trouble concentrating. Why? There's another essay lurking in my head! It has to get out before I'm going to get any work done. So here goes..."/>
			<outline text="The users outfoxed us again. It happens every fifteen years or so in this business, We lost our grounding, the users rebelled, and a new incarnation of the software business has been created. "/>
			<outline text="What is it? The Internet, of course. It's a very magic thing whose potential has barely been explored. New stuff is happening almost on a daily basis. There's a rebellious spirit to it. What are they rebelling against? The greedy VCs that funded the software industry who were too busy inventing scams to make Mitch Kapor-style money. (The scams didn't work.) And they're rebelling against Bill Gates, who has already made Mitch Kapor-style money, many times over, and posesses something much more offensive -- the power of FUD."/>
			<outline text="In the software business, FUD is the power to set the agenda, to keep anyone else from moving, to make everyone wait for you. It isn't entirely negative. FUD makes it possible for there to actually *be* an agenda. If the industry is run by random idiots, then this is preferrable. At least we're going somewhere, even if Bill always gets to name and play the tune."/>
			<outline text="But FUD leads to inbred thinking, a stifling of ideas, stagnation. FUD is the opposite of FUN. It brings things to a halt and makes things like the Internet possible. While the software industry was looking one way (obsession with Bill Gates), the users went the other. They stopped waiting for Bill and the rest of us."/>
			<outline text="Now the tail is wagging the dog! The old software industry is struggling (even flailing) to not be random idiots. The next versions of Windows, Macintosh and OS/2 are all Internet clients, with the standards supported -- Gopher, WAIS, FTP, Telnet, Mosaic, news groups, etc. It's an incredible thing because none of the platform vendors had any say in the definition of these standards! It isn't based on OpenDoc, OLE 2.0, Kaleida, Taligent, AppWare, or any of the various database standards that Philippe and Bill were arguing about a few years ago. Or even MAPI or VIM. Remember OCE? Do you remember how important those things seemed at the time?"/>
			<outline text="I think Bill got caught flat-footed here. At the Agenda 95 conference in September, I was surprised to hear him say that Microsoft's upcoming online service, Marvel, is a bet-the-company venture for the company. Now I think he's right. Bill is scrambling, he understands the stakes, and is doing the only reasonable thing he can do. The stakes are huge for him at a personal level: is he the next Ken Olson? Will Marvel be the DEC Rainbow of online systems??? "/>
			<outline text="[Respectfully, who remembers the Rainbow, or Ken Olson for that matter?]"/>
			<outline text="Bill can bring Apple to its knees. He may have Novell pinned down. Microsoft is a very impressive company. But Marvel can't compete with the Internet. Once the users take control, they never give it back. They allow a new industry to form, let the old one wither and fade, even die, and then repeat the process all over again. It happened in the transition from mainframes to minis, in the transition from minis to PCs. And it's happening again."/>
			<outline text="Marvel might end up being the IBM PC of the online world. I bet a lot of people will use it. But Microsoft is too heavily invested in the way things are to let it grow in the random way that the Internet is growing. The innovative fun stuff will happen outside of the reach of Microsoft's FUD."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: The first guy to turn me on to this line of thinking was Doug Michels at SCO. I bet he's chuckling as he reads this. Sally Atkins at Stanford understands it too. Any Unix shop on the planet gets it."/>

He's better at reinventing himself and his company and looking at new businesses. I suspect he just won't be good at giving up enough control and that (not the inability to do it again or find the next new thing) will be what does him in. Do it again, in this case, means find and start a new business, burying the old ones in the process, if necessary."/>
			<outline text="I'm not sure he'd throw out NT if it turned out that OS/2 or Macintosh Version X beat him to hell in the market and he had a chance to buy and own the new OS.  Maybe it depends not just how compelling the vision is, but how close to the heart it sits."/>

			<outline text="The deal needs to be re-designed."/>
			<outline text="To roll the deal out to the public, Apple should manufacture a private-label version of the Macintosh for IBM. Replace the 6-color Apple logo with a big blue IBM. Do a global search-and-replace in the docs, changing \&quot;Apple\&quot; to &quot;IBM.&quot; (Use Microsoft Word, if possible, just to add to the positive energy.)"/>

Here's your chance guys! The window is open now, and will stay open for a few years."/>

Sounds like fun!"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Scripting the Internet&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/22/94; 9:56:50 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A bunch of people have asked how this mailing list is implemented, so here's the story..."/>
			<outline text="In early October, when my friend Marc Canter was getting ready to roll out his new MediaBand product, I wanted to help get influential and interesting people to come to his press conference in San Francisco. I had a set of scripts that I had written last year that automated the upgrade process for Frontier script writers going from version 2.0 to 3.0. The upgrade was a big success, in part because of these scripts."/>
			<outline text="I went thru my rolodex, my computerized address book, old email messages, the Agenda 95 attendee list, made some phone calls, and built a list of addresses separated into three groups -- those accessible directly thru AppleLink, MCI users, and Internet addresses. I modified the scripts to add the appropriate boilerplate to each address so it could be correctly routed by the AppleLink server."/>
			<outline text="To add a new address to the list, I just open an outline, add a new headline and type in the person's email address. The script travels over the outline, gathering groups of eight addresses, and sends an email message to each group-of-eight. There's no magic to the number 8 (except it *is* a power of 2, once nerd, always a nerd...). I hate email that has 2000 names on it, and I thought people would find it interesting to see a small slice of the database at the head of each message. It also makes the script run 8 times faster."/>
			<outline text="I've thought about mixing it up a bit, so you'd be part of a different group every time. That might make the script a bit too complex. We'll see."/>
			<outline text="This grouping creates an interesting effect. It's kind of like sitting at a table of eight people eating dinner at an industry conference. When people reply to one of these essays, seven other people usually see the reply, and of course I do too. Maybe instead of letting it be random, I should try to match interesting groups of people with each other? What do you think???"/>
			<outline text="I use AppleLink to distribute these messages because it's the only scriptable Internet-onramp that I have on my hard disk. I understand that the new version of Eudora is also scriptable, I'd like to try it. Maybe someday America On-Line will support system-level scripting, and I'd gladly consider distributing my essays thru AOL if they do it. Same for Ziff's Interchange, or CompuServe, or Marvel, for that matter, if they do a scriptable Macintosh client."/>
			<outline text="I'm happy to share the script that drives this mailing list, even though you won't be able to run it, since the scriptable version of AppleLink isn't publicly available. But you may get some ideas how scripting a wide-area email system works, and maybe you can give me some ideas on how to improve it. Send email to dave.winer@applelink.apple.com and I'll send a copy of the script. (This offer expires on 10/31/94 -- who knows how long these messages will live? -- I still get requests for a freeware program I wrote in 1988!)."/>
			<outline text="In one of the earlier messages I said this was an experiment in electronic public relations. It's not. It's something else. I won't use this channel to promote products or people unless I think you can benefit from knowing about them. The list is not for sale or rent. At some point, it will evolve into a forum that you can access directly over the net and contribute to. Until then, I will continue to use scripts to push messages into your box. "/>
			<outline text="The ground rules remain very simple. Any replies are on-the-record and for-attribution, unless you state otherwise. I will gladly add or delete names from the list, immediately. Maintenence is done by a human being. No arcane commands. Just use English to express your pleasure or displeasure. And you may forward these messages anywhere you like.

			<outline text="Agenda 95 this year was a great experience for me, and I gather, for quite a few other people. So much nice business to do! The question -- why can't we have that kind of schmoozing opportunity more often than 3 nights out of 365? And why do we have to go to all the way to Phoenix to gossip about the software biz?"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/27/94; 9:32:52 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="First, I'd like to thank Bill Gates for taking the time to respond to my comments on the online industry, and on the pending deal between IBM and Apple Computer. He raises points that I think should be addressed directly, and then, in a separate essay, I have comments on Apple Computer and its relationship with Macintosh developers, a group which includes Bill and myself and others."/>
			<outline text="Bill -- I don't mind your characterizing my essays as demagoguery, and by implication, characterizing me a demagogue. I looked it up. It's a great word! It derives from the Greek, &quot;demagogos.&quot; Leader of the common people. In English it has a slightly different meaning: &quot;a person who tries to stir up the people by appeals to emotion, prejudice, etc. in order to win them over quickly, and in doing so, to gain power.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm..."/>
			<outline text="[I actually prefer another characterization of this medium as: &quot;... a community that is essentially faceless except for the local 'gang of 8.' Wide area broadcast with an edited letters section. Local direct connect but with alphabetical theme. A  benevolent editor with wide reaching powers. And an editorial voice like a kid in a candy store. Great! I can't wait for the next, er, episode?&quot;  -- Scott Wiener, Common Knowledge, developers of Arrange, scottw@netcom.com.]"/>
			<outline text="For me, the amazing thing is how ready the people are for something like a demagogue. They seem to be very fearful of something, Bill, and I think that something is you! Maybe this is what you want? But here's a challenging question. Are you the leader of the software industry, or are you just the leader of Microsoft? Do you have any kind or generous ideas or thoughts for other technologists in this business? Can you forgive Apple for its past transgressions and go forward from there? What do you want from us? I won't attempt to guess at this. And I'll take the rest of your comments at face-value, not try to read anything into them, although it is very tempting to do so."/>
			<outline text="Re respect -- I appreciate your statement -- &quot;I think you have done some great stuff for the Mac and I hope you continue to do more.&quot; It's mutual -- I've always had enormous respect for you personally, and the culture you've developed at Microsoft. I don't think I've ever said anything to contradict that. But I'd also like to point out that I've shipped award-winning software for the PC too. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Next subject... The Internet will not cause less computers to sell. Probably quite the opposite, I think that online stuff is driving a substantial part of the sales of PCs today, and I expect much more so in the future. It will not effect your sales of Encarta and Flight Simulator. In fact, since you are almost certainly making these products &quot;online-aware&quot; they will probably become more exciting, useful and entertaining. And more valuble."/>
			<outline text="The *real* question is: Is online a new industry, or is it part of the PC industry? I think you've made your position clear -- that online is part of the PC industry. It makes sense, being who you are, and where your interests lie, that you would see it this way. I respectfully disagree with this point of view. I think that the online business is fundamentally different from the PC software business. [I bet Ken Olson thought that PCs were an extension of the minicomputer business.]"/>
			<outline text="Re embracing the Internet, I believe you are probably doing everything you can. But you don't own the standards. That's why I say I think you got caught flat-footed. Don't take this personally, you are the leader of the PC industry. All the followers got caught flat-footed too."/>
			<outline text="Re betting the company -- I heard you say it. It shocked me. I've asked Stewart Alsop for the exact words you used, but apparently the transcripts from Agenda 95 aren't ready yet. Your comments were in response to a question from Mark Stahlman of New Media Associates. We'll have to wait Alsop &amp; Coursey to provide the exact quote."/>
			<outline text="Finally, switching gears, re Windows 95 and hardware upgrades,  I was thinking of plug and play. Windows 95 has gained a very valuble position as being everything a Macintosh is today. My point: not without a hardware upgrade. "/>
			<outline text="Plug and play, or SCSI as its known in the Macintosh world, is an incredibly valuble feature. It's one of the major weak links in the PC world. Apparently Windows 95 fixes this. But not without new hardware."/>
			<outline text="I had a personal experience a few months ago that brought this home for me. I installed a new utility on my AST 486 machine. Cool. But I lost my CD-ROM drive! Apparently the utility messed with my CONFIG.SYS or WIN.INI or AUTOEXEC.BAT or whatever, and now the driver software for the CD is lost. I was very upset! This kind of thing can't happen on a Macintosh because it's a plug and play system. It's a fundamentally more reliable design for a personal computer."/>
			<outline text="Again, Bill, thanks for appearing here. Your comments are welcome any time."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I've only seen Windows 95 running on friends' computers. If you'd like to send me a copy (on floppy, for previously stated reasons) I'd be happy to install it and try it out."/>

			<outline text="PPPPS: And don't confuse demogogue with demo god -- a term which I coined in the early 80's and would like to be credited with!"/>

			<outline text="Dave - your mail is stimulating because the Internet is a very important &quot;external&quot; development but why the demagoguery?"/>
			<outline text="Marvel is not a bet the company thing. Nothing I said at Agenda could have been misinterpreted to suggest it. We haven't decided exactly what we are going do and that's why we haven't announced anything."/>
			<outline text="I am not sure this industry gets its best discussion when it takes a serious issue and turn it into an attack on one person complete with insults. Perhaps you have read some of the more extreme things written about me. In terms of your own work with Microsoft and me personally do you feel wronged in some way? I think you have done some great stuff for the Mac and I hope you continue to do more."/>
			<outline text="The Internet is a great phenomena. I dont see how the emergence of more information content on a network can be a bad thing for the personal computer industry. Will it cause less personal computers to sell? I think quite the opposite. Less copies of Flight Simulator or Encarta?"/>
			<outline text="All sorts of things come along from outside the PC industry to fuel our growth - Color LCDs, Cheap disks, CD-ROM technology, Tcp/IP, UNIX, ATM... These things are wonderful and make the industry fun and the Internet is certainly one of them."/>
			<outline text="I don't know if online people will make much money. I know if they view themselves as competing with the Internet they will not. Marvel is an exciting project and I hope we do well with it but like most Microsoft projects we will have to learn from the marketplace. Sometimes we do well and sometimes we don't."/>
			<outline text="What do you think we or others should be doing more to embrace the Internet? Have you tried Windows 95 on the Internet or used our WEB content or seen the WEB support in Word. We want to do our best on all of this and welcome additional ideas. We have included everything for an Internet server in NT with its resource kit and are doing a lot of work with k-12 schools to get them hooked up to the internet."/>
			<outline text="***Re: It's a Great Computer, Steve"/>
			<outline text="I was noticing your comment about Windows'95 in the context of a Mac discussion."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has been supportive of the Mac from day 1. We were the only company shipping software with the original machine. Other large developers have humiliated the Mac thru their statements or by dropping support in some cases many times. Over the last few years we have introduced more new titles for the Mac than any other company. This is despite Apple suing us and discriminating against us in disclosing information to our applications groups who signed unique personal non-disclosure agreements. One interesting thing I would be glad to send you a copy of are the letters I sent to Apple in 1984 and 1985 asking them to license the Mac and giving them ideas about who to work with. Amazingly Apple got mad at us for even suggesting this."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft makes more money when a Mac is sold than when a Windows machine is sold even when you account for the systems software difference. The other ISVs just haven't done enough on the Mac. Despite this economic interest which is pro-Mac I think there should be objective comparisons made."/>
			<outline text="You say that Windows 95 will require a lot more hardware. I have been using Windows 95 for months and it runs faster with the same memory than previous generations. I think the Mac can continue to do super well while being honest about what Windows 95 is. Microsoft continues to invest in the Mac because we believe in its future. One thing you might want to look at is take an application on x86 and compare memory working set on powerpc. The only reason I mention this is your comment about people needing more memory."/>

			<outline text="Love is what it's about."/>
			<outline text="This is going to take some explaining."/>
			<outline text="When I woke up this morning there was a bunch of flowers in my mailbox from Bill Gates. What a guy! At the end of my last essay I said that I didn't have a Windows 95 beta to play with. Bill-the-Platform-Vendor correctly read the message. Dave wants flowers. The love letter in my mailbox began &quot;Bill Gates requested that we add you to the Windows 95 Beta Program.&quot; Ohhhh."/>
			<outline text="Another platform vendor who gets it, Jean-Louis Gassee (Be Inc, jlg@be.com), had sent me a love letter too. I can't repeat his message here, it was too sexy."/>
			<outline text="Have you read the Celestine Prophecy? These guys were getting me ready to write this angry love letter to Apple Computer. Reminding me that love is out there. There *are* options. "/>
			<outline text="Developer relations is a mating game. The platform vendors are the guys. Developers are the girls. Send flowers. You always score big. Like wives and girlfriends, developers just want to be cared for. It's the little things that count. That's a big secret. You sent flowers last week? So what! You gotta send them every week, rain or shine."/>
			<outline text="Apple always made a big deal of how many girlfriends it had. And it went for the sluts (Lotus, Borland, etc) and ignored the ones that cooked the meals, cleaned the house, made the babies. You can hear a lot of that in the Gates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/94/10/replyfrombillgates.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on Apple. "/>
			<outline text="I've gotten my share of flowers from Apple, mostly in 1986-87. There was a renaissance at Apple in that period. The Macintosh market was booming. Emerging from hard times, good people digging out, and a big party for the faithful and lucky developers who survived the mess of late 84-85. I remember those times very fondly. I did win-win deals, almost routinely, with Apple. Many thanks to Guy Kawasaki, Bill Campbell and Jean-Louis Gassee, who understood very well that a good developer is worth a hundred promiscuous girlfriends. In those days my mailbox overflowed with floral arrangements. And I cooked some great meals!"/>
			<outline text="Then, a very predictable thing happened. Kawasaki, Campbell, Gassee and people of similar spirit were forced out. A legion of employees invaded the platform, hired by other employees to replace the developers with high-paid, low-output, loveless computer scientists. That's the major reason Apple's economics are way out of whack right now."/>
			<outline text="Back to Gates... I have never heard him say a negative thing about the Macintosh. Quite the opposite. An example. At the System 7 rollout, not a single Apple exec could explain why the new OS was so cool. I sat in the audience, amazed that Bill Gates was the only one on stage who could get me excited about System 7. (It was also amazing that I was in the audience. I was the only developer in the room that was actually building on System 7 in a meaningful way. I was being punished for that. I could have given a very stirring speech, but Apple people were afraid that some of them would lose their jobs if I was successful.)"/>
			<outline text="On October 23, in an email to me, Gates said &quot;Other large developers have humiliated the Mac thru their statements or by dropping support in some cases many times. Over the last few years we have introduced more new titles for the Mac than any other company. This is despite Apple suing us and discriminating against us...&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Has Apple ever thanked Bill Gates for developing for the Macintosh? What about Paul Brainerd? John Warnock? Tim Gill? Marc Canter? Nat Goldhaber? Don Brown? Leonard Rosenthol? Andrew Singer? What about me???"/>
			<outline text="Why not take Gates at face value? If he's produced so much Macintosh software without any gratitude from Apple, maybe he'd support the platform even more enthusiastically if Apple showed just a bit of appreciation. "/>
			<outline text="1994 is the ten-year anniversary of the shipment of the Macintosh. Did Apple honor the developers who were there at startup? Absolutely not. Not even a plaque. Not even an email saying thank you. I was really pissed. Didn't say anything. "/>
			<outline text="At the ten-year celebration at Moscone Center in San Francisco on January 6, I sat in the audience, fuming, listening to Bill &amp; Andy talk about the magic of the Macintosh, how great *they* were, without a single reference to any developers. Where was Spindler? Didn't he have anything to say at this important milestone? "/>
			<outline text="Today, Macintosh is an empty loveless house. Not a home. All the developers walked but left the babies behind. Not because of market share, that can be fixed with economic tweaks. We walked because Apple is a lousy lover."/>

			<outline text="Predictably, I've gotten a lot of mail on the &quot;Platform is Chinese Household&quot; piece that went out early Saturday morning. "/>
			<outline text="I really hope we hear from Apple before the cursor moves off the Macintosh and onto something else."/>
			<outline text="Here are comments from Danny Goodman, Dan Farber, Jerry Michalski, an anonymous former platform vendor and Marc Canter."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Danny Goodman, author, danny.g@applelink.apple.com"/>
			<outline text="Windows users don't realize how important the Mac OS is to their well-being. If it weren't for the Mac and its modest success, 50 million personal computer users would still be staring at a C&gt; prompt every morning, because there would have been little incentive for Microsoft to go any further in usability design."/>
			<outline text="One element missing from your discussion so far is the creativity that the Mac OS unleashed in its developers prior to Win 3.1, when the Mac OS had clearly superior possibilities. The Mac OS's unique technologies (even if they need a bit of goosing up, such as telephony) might again attract the best and brightest developers to make these boxes do great things they haven't done before."/>
			<outline text="***Dan Farber, PC WEEK, 364-5972@mcimail.com"/>
			<outline text="Spindler is very sharp, but Apple is isolated from the world. Who from Apple, like a Bill from Microsoft, is engaging in this discussion?"/>
			<outline text="I don't believe [Bill Gates] would be terribly hurt if Mac sales were converted to Windows. But he also understands that he needs a competitor for better or worse."/>
			<outline text="The world is worse of because Apple hasn't been able to leverage its technology and establish a more viable alternative to MS."/>
			<outline text="What must be going on in [Markkula]'s head?"/>
			<outline text="***Jerry Michalski, RELease 1.0, spiff@panix.com"/>
			<outline text="Based on some of our earlier conversations, I've been bringing up the question of developer support with any relevant people I run into. DOS and Windows may be crapola development environments, but Microsoft more than makes up for that in other ways. And you know my theory: fielding a deeply flawed OS is a way to spawn a frothy third-party software community."/>
			<outline text="***Anonymous Ex-Platform Vendor"/>
			<outline text="In mid-1989, as VP-Marketing at XXX, I was given responsibility for the developer program. What a mess. Most of the few remaining active developers were on their last legs, no major developers were coming on board, ship rates were sinking fast, etc. etc."/>
			<outline text="We came up with a plan to turn things around within 18 months.  We really, really listened to developers.  "/>
			<outline text="But after years of neglect, they were too weak to survive is the story of why XXX is no longer in the computer business. In the period from 1985-1989, too much faith was lost by the developers in the commitment of the company to them. When things changed for the better, it was too late."/>
			<outline text="The moral may be that you have to keep your developers happy, do win-win deals, &amp; make them your partners. Once you lose the development momentum, you lose the market share war."/>

			<outline text="A few random notes... In the Chinese Household piece, I forgot to thank Mike Boich, Apple's first evangelist. In 1983, when the Mac 128 was in beta, we had a problem getting something working (actually a lot of things!). I called Mike. He got in his car, drove over to our offices at Living Videotext, sat down at our Lisa, and found the bug for us. Amazing! How far we've come (or gone!)."/>
			<outline text="If there's any kindred spirit left at Apple, I'd love to get an adaptation of MacTCP to work with UserLand's IAC Tools library. It should be a small job for someone who knows TCP well. Other developers are using this library. Source code available. Any Apple person with the engineering experience, and the will to help out a developer, please send mail to dave.winer@applelink.apple.com."/>

A chance to discuss a media/software related topic with intelligent and accomplished people. Lots of great schmoozes and software demos. If you're in the Bay Area this weekend, you're invited.

			<outline text="***THE SAN FRANCISCO NEWSPAPER STRIKE"/>
			<outline text="I had lunch on Wednesday with Rory O'Connor, a writer at the San Jose Mercury-News, rjoconnor@aol.com. We talked about various computer industry things. We also talked about the newspaper strike in San Francisco. "/>
			<outline text="The next day, I was driving to the grocery store and heard a report on KQED-FM about the strike paper, the Free Press. All the striking reporters and columnists are continuing to write. The problem is manufacturing and distribution. They could write, but how would they get the stories to the readers? The owners of the SF papers own the printing plant and distribution system. But do they own the only one? What about the information superhighway? Well, what about it??? Hah!"/>
			<outline text="I called Rory from my cellphone. I was breathless. Left a voicemail. When I got home, he had left a voicemail with the name of the leader of the strike paper. I sent him an email (bkoon@well.com). Within 15 minutes I had an idea of what was going on. They're doing a home page. Of course!"/>
			<outline text="Wow!"/>
			<outline text="I offered any help I could provide. Strictly as a volunteer. The offer is still open. I have the time. "/>
			<outline text="The online-ization of San Francisco's newspapers could be a major historic event. Especially because it's happening on the eve of an election. What if there's an earthquake tomorrow? Mud-slides?"/>
			<outline text="I want to get involved if it's at all possible. "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***WOMEN AND COMPUTERS"/>
			<outline text="Some people were surprised at the Chinese Household piece, because it seemed to step right up to the line of political correctness. These people were mostly men. The women, including one self-described ardent feminist, seemed to like the piece. [She said &quot;I try not to get offended on principle.&quot; Thanks!] "/>
			<outline text="Perhaps we've arrived at a place where men can once again write about women? We'll see! [Fear is frozen fun.]"/>
			<outline text="Respectfully, I've noticed that a lot more women are interested in computers than ever before. Even women that aren't in the computer business. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;I want to get on this superhighway thing&quot; seems to be what they're saying. And why not? Women are the networkers of our species. But the vast majority of women aren't on the highway yet. That's changing now. And in that change is a potential boom unlike any we've seen. "/>
			<outline text="My prediction: eventually, the online world will be managed by women. The role of men, as usual, will be to make it safe for women to create and run our civilization. We'll bring them technology. The information superhighway won't be a cave. It'll be a home. I know this is wildly optimistic. Reality will probably be something less than this. "/>
			<outline text="But the unmistakable women's touch, even in a post-feminist age, will make logging on more like coming home. "/>
			<outline text="It's an excellent time to rethink online software with this new audience in mind. They're buying their cars. Learning how to drive. "/>
			<outline text="They seem to be choosing America On-Line, but even this very colorful iconish approach to networking has too many detours and anachronistic features. "/>
			<outline text="There's a lot more to say about this, of course..."/>

			<outline text="***MULTI-MEGABITS OVER NORMAL PHONE LINES"/>
			<outline text="Another idea to get breathless about. What if you could replace your 14,400 baud modem with a $99 device that can transmit at more than 1,000,000 baud? How would that change the nature of online software?"/>
			<outline text="I had a phone talk earlier this week with one of my subscribers about this. With all sincerity, he said this was going to happen within the next few months. He was believable, assuming you're ready to believe. I'm not sure I am."/>
			<outline text="It's an interesting mental exercise. Relax the rules of modem-based client/server software. You can now send color bitmaps and animations and music more freely. Synchronization is much cheaper, so you can do more of it. Online clients will be able to view the net more as a hard disk, and less as a very slow floppy drive. "/>

			<outline text="***OTHER DEVELOPMENTS"/>
			<outline text="Starting with this essay, all messages are routed thru the Internet. AppleLink is no longer a special service as far as the scripts are concerned. The next step is to move to my own Internet domain, and instead of using the AppleLink client to distribute the messages, I'm going to use Qualicomm's Eudora Internet mailer program. Eudora is very scriptable, and unlike AppleLink, it appears to have a future. Leonard Rosenthol of Aladdin Systems points out that Eudora is probably the most widely used scriptable app on the Macintosh. Very interesting."/>
			<outline text="I've reworked the scripts. Now the group-of-eight is random each time. You'll have an opportunity, with each message, to meet seven new people all of whom share an interest in this kind of stuff. And they're not all from the computer business. "/>
			<outline text="This change also creates the opportunity for bugs. I've tested the new scripts as thoroughly as possible. My fingers are crossed, toes too. ;-&gt; "/>
			<outline text="And it's raining in California! This is great, because the dry season is over. Rain makes the roof leak, and there will be power outages. Should be fun!"/>

			<outline text="I got invovled in the online-ization of San Francisco's newspapers. What a trip!"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday at this time I knew that HTML is a markup language that is the basic standard that Mosaic/Web pages are built on. Today I have a script that builds a hierarchy of formatted Web pages from a folder structure on a Macintosh hard disk containing plain ASCII text files with no markups."/>
			<outline text="There's a nice story to tell, but I've gotten so busy I only have about an hour to write it up. Things are happening quickly now. "/>
			<outline text="On Saturday, I sent email to Chris Gulker (chrisg@sfgate.com). Chris is the MIS guy at the Examiner, and a customer of ours at UserLand Software. He's one of the most imaginative and persistent script writers out there. But Chris's story is one of frustration. For the last few years, he's been developing fantastic new ways to open up the content of the Examiner for online users. But the owners of the paper never let him go on the air. Apparently, they were scared to let the content get out that way (what about advertisers?). Chris kept trying and trying. Until the strike came along, the technology was always getting postponed. Now that the strike is here, everything has turned around."/>
			<outline text="Chris is on the management side of the strike. He said in his email: &quot;The entire Electric Examiner is HTML-ized by Frontier. A script takes all the text from our mainframe, makes HTML, makes all the home pages and puts everything in a 'send me' folder. A FTP utility called Fetch then uploads it all to the server. One person can do the whole paper in less than an hour. Still some bugs. I wrote the script the Wednesday morning after strike.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Chris has an automated Web-builder. I wanted my own!"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, I had received a reply from the strikers. They were breathless too! Love at first sight."/>
			<outline text="So I got on the phone, called my friend Brian Zisk (zisk@well.com). He's a young, former Grateful Dead merchandiser, who moved to San Francisco last year with an intuition that the next big thing is the online business, and that San Francisco is the place to tap into this. Brian has been working on canter.com, Marc Canter's online version of the Media Band. I met Brian thru my friend David Jacobs (bigdave@applelink.apple.com), who among his other adventures, writes a column for Wired magazine."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Let's get a newspaper on the Web,&quot; I said to Brian. He called his friend Cynsa Bonorris (cynsa@well.com). The three of us met at Brian's house in the Haight early Sunday afternoon. "/>
			<outline text="In about six hours of the best collaborative programming I've ever done, we created a script that combined all I know about scripting the Mac OS with all Cynsa knows about creating hierarchies of Web pages."/>
			<outline text="Cynsa reallllly knows what she's doing. Two worlds that always should have been connected now work together. Editorial people can be editorial people, writing text, not HTML programs. The pages look beautiful. And consistent. They can do instant updates, reacting to late-breaking news. Especially important on the day before an election."/>
			<outline text="We weren't the first to do it. Chris Gulker got there first. I bet our scripts are better. They will get even better. I'm totally itchy to get my own web server up and on the air. It'll be an incredible test-bed for tweaking up these scripts."/>
			<outline text="And two newspapers are now online in the most wired city in America. Last week there were none."/>

			<outline text="The following excerpts are from an English translation of Umberto Eco's back-page column, &quot;La Bustina di Minerva,&quot; in the Italian news weekly &quot;Espresso,&quot; September 30, 1994. Thanks to Steve Everhard of Apple Computer UK for passing this along."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="&quot;Insufficient consideration has been given to the new underground religious war which is modifying the modern world.  It's an old idea of mine, but I find that whenever I tell people about it they immediately agree with me. "/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="&quot;The fact is that the world is divided between users of the Macintosh computer and users of MS-DOS compatible computers.  I am firmly of the opinion that the Macintosh is Catholic and that DOS is Protestant.  Indeed, the Macintosh is counter-reformist and has been influenced by the 'ratio studiorum' of the Jesuits.  It is cheerful, friendly, conciliatory, it tells the faithful how they must proceed step by step to reach--if not the Kingdom of Heaven--the moment in which their document is printed.  It is catechistic:  the essence of revelation is dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icons. Everyone has a right to salvation. "/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="&quot;DOS is Protestant, or even Calvinistic.  It allows free interpretation of scripture, demands difficult personal decisions, imposes a subtle hermeneutics upon the user, and takes for granted the idea that not all can reach salvation.  To make the system work you need to interpret the program yourself:  a long way from the baroque community of revellers, the user is closed within the loneliness of his own inner torment. "/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="&quot;You may object that, with the passage to Windows, the DOS universe has come to resemble more closely the counter-reformist tolerance of the Macintosh.  It's true:  Windows represents an Anglican-style schism, big ceremonies in the cathedral, but there is always the possibility of a return to DOS to change things in accordance with bizarre decisions; when it comes down to it, you can decide to allow women and gays to be ministers if you want to.  "/>
			<outline text="&quot;And machine code, which lies beneath both systems (or environments, if you prefer)?  Ah, that is to do with the Old Testament, and is talmudic and cabalistic...&quot;"/>

			<outline text="I must be shifting gears! I spent most of last week in learning mode: learning new software, learning about real journalism, browsing the worldwide web (a new kind of journalism), and getting ready to take a short break before heading off in a new direction. "/>
			<outline text="There's a lot of work to do..."/>
			<outline text="First, some people, Mark Stahlman in particular, want to know if a new newsletter is going to be my new business. No. I'm just writing to learn, to be connected to the world, to express myself. Stewart, Esther, David, Denise, Jerry, John, Fred, Amy, Jeff, Dick, Tim, et al, have nothing to fear from me. "/>
			<outline text="I am still a software developer, an opinionated one, and I like to write. When I have a new product to show I'll go on the usual press tour and hope that the pundits approve of what I'm doing. And I carry the conflicts of interest of a developer. [The only software company or online company that I own stock in is UserLand Software. If that changes I'll let you know.]"/>
			<outline text="Before I started writing essays in early October, I spent three months pulling together an &quot;online-aware&quot; software product. After writing 20 essays, receiving hundreds of email replies, and learning a lot more about the Internet, the world looks so different! This new perspective will be incorporated into the new product. "/>
			<outline text="Will I continue to do Macintosh software? Of course! It's funny -- when you view the world thru an Internet lens, the Mac doesn't seem defeated. Quite the opposite! The tools are so good. And the Mac OS is easy to set up for Internet access. Macintosh users seem more powerful and visible on the net. Or maybe I just haven't found the Windows users yet? Not sure about this. But I don't hear any of the &quot;I'm using an obsolete computer&quot; whining you hear in the business world."/>
			<outline text="I've also seen that there's a ton of undeveloped potential in Macintosh Internet tools because they're open; it's easy to build on what they do. I learned about Eudora, the popular mailer program, and got a glimpse of the potential in AnArchie and Netscape too. It's easy to create new software that build on these programs, in scripts or in C, because they are so open."/>
			<outline text="An example -- before last week I was using AppleLink to distribute essays because its client is scriptable. That meant I could send essays to groups of eight people, without long &quot;To:&quot; lists. And I could keep my list private, while still giving people an idea of who else was receiving the essays. "/>
			<outline text="In other words, I was able to tweak the email system to exactly suit my needs. That's what  scripting is all about."/>
			<outline text="But AppleLink is a dead-end. Fortunately, while I was taking a break from the software business in the first half of 1994, Qualicomm released Eudora 2.0 and did everything that AppleLink does. And Eudora is anything but a dead-end! It's a standard, and appears to be growing. It seems like a safe place to do some development."/>
			<outline text="So I converted my &quot;BlastMail&quot; scripts to drive Eudora instead of AppleLink. Publishing new essays is now totally turnkey. Write the essay in Eudora, select a command from the menu bar, and whoosh, it goes out to all the people on the list in neat groups of eight. New menu commands in Eudora can add a new subscriber, delete a subscriber, back things up, send out past issues. And there's a command that parses Eudora's inbox, looking for messages with subjects containing the name of one of the services. It adds the sender to the list of people subscribing to the service. This is Dave's agent, the script that co-signed some of my releases last week. I even was able to add a command that removes hard carriage returns from the paragraph I have selected in Eudora. It may seem like a little thing, but I hate stripping hard returns out by hand."/>
			<outline text="Thanks to Steve Dorner, the author of Eudora, who did a great job! [With thanks to Leonard Rosenthol for taking care of Eudora's connection with Frontier, and talking them into supporting menu sharing, this is a very big deal.]"/>
			<outline text="But there's more than email. I plan to put my essays, and your replies, up on a Web server. I can't possibly resist that temptation. Like everyone else doing home pages, I want to show off and make my pages look better than anyone else's. Showing off for me will be expressed in terms of the best writing and the best scripts. My pages will be beautifully structured and organized because my scripts make it *easy* to be beautifully structured and organized."/>
			<outline text="Coming at the Internet from these two angles, email automation and web-publishing, has led me to a new business for UserLand Software -- development tools for the Internet. Perfecting the two suites, the Automated Webster and BlastMail, is a very high priority. [I'm also excited about using Frontier to write Internet servers, with Frontier Runtime installed as the client. More on this later...]"/>
			<outline text="All the scripts will be made available freely. UserLand's incentive: drive the positioning of Frontier as an essential developer tool for Internet publishing."/>
			<outline text="So there's the first angle for Dave's New Business. It's built on the original business -- Frontier. UserLand got lucky. The Internet needs development tools. Frontier can make the Macintosh a much more productive environment for Internet content developers. "/>

			<outline text="***Re: &quot;Platform is Chinese Household&quot;"/>
			<outline text="You're wrong in thinking that we neither recognize the contributions of nor value our developers. We do very much on both counts. You're certainly right on the other hand in saying that we have shanked the developer program in a number of ways in the past. The gentlemen you mention certainly did their magic but I fear I contributed as well shortly after taking the &quot;helm.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="But we are working hard to fix that - and to improve the fortunes (literally) of our developers. I have been constantly on the bandwagon for the past 6 months inside AppleSoft and out on the importance of doing what we can do to make our developers successful, most recently at our three international sales meetings where I tried to rouse the field guys to get much more aggressive with helping &quot;local&quot; developers be successful with their products and their overall business. Of course, the best thing we could do would be to increase our marketshare - but that's a longer story (which will unfold by itself, I am sure). "/>
			<outline text="We are in the process of revamping our developer programs with a view to helping the smaller developer. We also are trying to work much more closely with key large developers (the usual suspects) since their &quot;support&quot; for the platform is both key to success in the commercial segments and important for the press. To succeed in the platform game, it's clear that we have to deal effectively both with the trade and popular press - you can't imagine how much time this takes. "/>
			<outline text="So there are a number of things we are doing - and I am very serious about this. Does it mean that I'll always do everything right by the developers? Probably not from their point of view but I am trying very hard to balance the realities of our current business model with the need to do everything possible to help the developers - both large and small - to succeed better on our platform than on the other guys. "/>
			<outline text="I know that the good old guys are no longer around and from your perspective there are too often a bunch of &quot;suits&quot; in their place - but the world and our business is a whole lot more complex than when the pioneers were around. So... different folks, different problems, different behaviors - some for the better, some for the worst. What *does* seem to be a constant is that virtually everyone at Apple really does want to make a difference still - the culture here is still far, far from IBM-like. I just think we've lost a lot of the &quot;major personalities&quot; and it's created a very different feel for those our you who deal with us. "/>
			<outline text="It has indeed been a very difficult transition for us over the past couple of years. Our profitability (gross margins) worse than halved in a little over a year and that factor alone created incredible pressures (quite apart from the layoff -itself a delightful experience...). Those pressures are certainly felt by our employees, virtually all of whom are working incredibly hard to make our platform a success. It's been admittedly difficult at times to keep the morale high; the employees are barraged every day with popular and trade press opinions that we're going to be crushed under the Gates steamroller (maybe if he starts spending more of his time in those old book auctions...). "/>
			<outline text="And of course there are a lot of startups currently, particularly in the multimedia space, and we have an awful lot of folks targeting our employees as well. We've always had a superior workforce - it's one of the real strengths of Apple. For example, I don't know if you know but Bill opened a recruiting office in Cupertino just down the street from our R&amp;D facility. Morale is actually pretty good now (it was certainly at a low point 6 months ago) but these things can change quickly so keeping morale high is a major goal. "/>
			<outline text="So, like your Chinese family, we have and continue to change. But don't pay too much attention to the superficial changes. Despite the changes there is a certain core of the culture that's intact - there's a tremendous passion at Apple to do great products - and to be a great company. The styles are different, perhaps the pressure's greater - the go/go, indulgent 80's are over and folks here are hunkering down and getting to work without some of the flamboyance of the past. "/>
			<outline text="I'm actually feeling more positive in a number of ways than I've felt for years. We have a good strategy; we have some fantastic technologies and great people; we're developing some new and aggressive marketing talent; we're working on mostly the right things; and the other side has its share of problems to look forward to in the next couple of years. And we've adjusted to our new financial model extremely well. Obviously I don't want to appear too pollyana here - success is certainly not guaranteed. But I truly think we are better situated to do so than we've been in years. And I can guarantee you it's going to be as exciting as hell the next couple of years!"/>

			<outline text="I'm back from my breather. Aired out. Well-fed both emotionally and physically. The body-surfing at Maui was fantastic. Had a shiatsu on Wednesday. Life is just great. Back to writing software, and back to writing essays! Yeah."/>
			<outline text="Dave Nagel's reply to my Chinese Household piece arrived just as I was rushing to get on the plane to Hawaii. When I got back, I re-read it. I had a choice, I could let the debate on Apple-and-developers end there. Or I could re-stoke it. "/>
			<outline text="I decided to add fuel to the fire. An opposing viewpoint. A humor-filled dialog with a demagogue. Let's have some fun! ">
				<outline text="Q: How many Apple people does it take to screw in a lightbulb? "/>
				<outline text="A: One. He or she just holds the bulb and waits while the world "/>
				<outline text="turns around him or her."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's an old joke, but it's still funny. "/>
			<outline text="Apple is looking inward for its answer. They're going to try to dig out by doing more development. "/>
			<outline text="I've heard this before. There was Family Farm, Pink (now called Taligent), The Comm Toolbox, AOCE, AppleScript, Object Model, Balloon Help, Kaleida, QuickDraw GX, QuickTime, on and on. I stopped paying attention about a year ago, so there may be more now. Did any of these have major impact, could they have dug Apple out of a deep hole? No way."/>
			<outline text="Instead Apple should be changing the economics of the platform. "/>
			<outline text="Dave: Apple should stop looking inward for the answer. Do your software shopping in the developer world. You get there sooner and it costs less. "/>
			<outline text="An example..."/>
			<outline text="How much did AppleScript cost Apple to develop? Frontier cost less than $1 million. I'll bet you a lunch at Siam Garden that AppleScript cost considerably more. Even if you spent *exactly* what we spent, MacWEEK says we got more bang-per-buck, by a very wide margin: we got 4 stars on value compared to 3 stars for AppleScript. Ours costs $495, yours costs $189. [The comparative review appeared in the 4/11/94 issue.]"/>
			<outline text="A similar economy could have been formed by substituting QuickMail for AOCE. Director for QuickTime. Display PostScript for QuickDraw GX. MicroPhone for the Comm Toolbox. The economics of third party software are far more favorable than the economics of internal development at Apple."/>
			<outline text="Plus you'd have gotten the competitive advantage of not having held up the market while your engineers got their software ready. To this day, if Apple found a way to make Frontier acceptable (for example) you'd be adding a nice hurdle for the other guys to climb over. In shipping software, not in vapor or vague promises. [How about doing deal with MacroMedia instead of making QuickTime competitive with it?]"/>
			<outline text="Now, when a developer moves into an area, someone at Apple stands up and says &quot;I just had a great idea!&quot; Immediately it seems, that idea is telegraphed to the world. And the developer has big problems. I speak from experience. "/>
			<outline text="[Try it in SimCity. Build a small town. Demolish the power plant. Note that the lights go out.]"/>
			<outline text="I want to stop shaking my head about this. Apple is like a slow car hogging the fast lane. They're spoiling all the fun of a growing platform. I'd like to see that change. "/>
			<outline text="Another joke, this time with no punchline. "/>
			<outline text="Q: Why is Lotus Notes a PC phenomenon? The PC platform has totally random networking. Mac has built-in standardized networking. Mac should be the platform of choice for networked PCs. Why isn't it?"/>
			<outline text="A: Developers were scared off by rumors of AppleMail, which turned out to be a total disappointment, years late, incredibly expensive to develop, and strategically disastrous because it killed the Macintosh network apps market before it had a chance to start. [BTW, because of TCP/IP, we get another shot at a vibrant networking market for the Mac. We don't have to worry about Apple because they don't &quot;own&quot; the standard. Whew!]"/>
			<outline text="Dave: When you shut down developers, you're cutting off the life support system for users. That's an important reason your margins are shrinking. No one will pay a premium for a platform with a slow-growth app base. Especially when the competition has a high-growth app base, and isn't premium priced. "/>
			<outline text="You imply in your message that market share is what it's about. I still disagree. Today's Mac market is bigger than the DOS market was back in the mid-80s. If the economics were tweaked, if Apple got out of the way, the market would be creating millionaires again. "/>
			<outline text="You seem to be more focused on Apple-the-company than Mac-the-platform. I see the interests of today's Apple as often being counter to the interests of the platform. Apple wants to employ more people. The platform wants more software choices. As brutal as it may sound, I think that Apple's downsizing its R&amp;D could be a great thing for the platform. As you pull back from areas, let us know, do stuff to encourage developers and other investors to start new projects in those areas. "/>
			<outline text="Kawasaki had one thing right -- his motto for evangelism was Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom. There are the flowers again! [Compare this with Steve Job's motto: &quot;We can't let just *anyone* develop for this machine.&quot; Another Steve Jobs-ism, uttered by the top evangelist at General Magic: &quot;We have room for 10 developers in our program, and we already have 10.&quot; Compare this to a statement made by an Apple guy -- &quot;We're not trying to crush you.&quot; Try saying that to your girlfriend. When I got pissed, he reminded me that he said *not*. Ohhh that made me feel **much** better!]"/>
			<outline text="To Dave Nagel -- let's shake it up, rock and roll, let's have fun! Make Apple lean and mean, stick to enhancing the basic components of the Macintosh: the Menu Manager, Window Manager, Standard File, TextEdit, ResEdit, etc. (but don't break apps!); produce lots more clean sample code, and leave the speculative stuff to developers."/>
			<outline text="It's time to shake up the basic assumption at Apple -- that the Mac depends on Apple to develop smashing new software. It doesn't. It depends on people other than Apple. Until your economics reflect that, and Apple people stop thinking they're the focal point of this software economy, the platform will be sick, and Apple will sink."/>
			<outline text="There's an even bigger reason to turn the Macintosh into the ultimate developer-friendly platfrom. It's a feature Microsoft can never implement for Windows. No matter how well they communicate with developers (they're absolutely tops), they also dominate the app market on their own platform. Mac could become the platform where users have real choices. Because developers love it there."/>
			<outline text="Ooops, it got back to LOVE! (Please just send flowers Dave...)"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Postscript to Bill Gates and his flowers -- it turns out that I have to sign a NDA to be one of 50,000 people to get an official beta of Windows 95. I hate NDAs, and only sign them when I think there's a reasonable chance that I don't compete with the person/company that requests it. Otherwise I wait. Maybe we can get rid of gratuitous NDAs if developers were more reluctant to sign them? They aren't without cost. I once had a product release killed because of a NDA I signed with a competitor. Did you know that Digital Research's GEM operating system was killed because of an NDA? Windows 95 is not a secret. I'd sign a letter that said that anytime I wrote about it, I'd mention that it isn't a shipping product. That seems reasonable. But I've already seen reviews comparing it to OS/2 Warp, which *is* shipping (and getting great reviews -- congrats to IBM)."/>
			<outline text="PPS: I skipped Comdex, so I haven't seen a demo of Microsoft Network yet. I'd love to assemble a set of quotes and facts about it, happy to release it as a seasons greeting. I hear it doesn't build on the Internet any more than AOL or CompuServe, i.e. you can send email over the net, but you can't browse web pages, or access their libraries thru FTP, or browse UseNet groups. What else is significant about Microsoft Network? Does it seems a bit unfair to AOL and CompuServe that it will be bundled with Windows 95? Will they have a Macintosh client? This one definitely seems to be a power grab, Microsoft seems to be using their monopoly in operating systems to diminish competition in another market."/>

			<outline text="&quot;Let A Thousand Flowers Bloom&quot; is going to be a big one. It's the Sunday after Thanksgiving and I've already received a dozen pieces of mail about it. "/>
			<outline text="Some observations, based on the comments I've received so far... "/>
			<outline text="1. Whether or not there's any hope for Apple, there are lessons that can be learned here. There are other platforms, and there will be more. Let's archive what we've learned here so others don't have to repeat these mistakes. Apple's ability to respond is irrelevent. [Personally I do believe there's hope for Apple, $10 billion companies don't just disappear, but even if I didn't I'd still have written and released the piece.] "/>
			<outline text="2. Maybe Apple *really* is licensing the OS in a meaningful way? Then there will soon be other companies in the Macintosh business. Maybe they can compete with Apple by working better with developers? Isn't this a *really* interesting idea? The tables may turn, Apple may be competing for the attention of developers, in a way that even they can't miss. [I'd love to hear from one or more of Apple's licensees. Please give me a call. We could make some amazing stuff happen.] "/>
			<outline text="3. Lately, the trades, particularly PC WEEK, have been pretty doomy and gloomy on Apple. I wanted to point out that there's a possible upside to Apple's downsizing. At this point licensing would be great, but there's much more that can be done besides licensing. "/>
			<outline text="4. Finally, even if Apple still tries to make it seem like all the important software comes from them, by airing these views so publicly, I hoped to create some space for significant software to come from places other than Apple. In other words, &quot;Let A Thousand Flowers Bloom&quot; was written for everyone, not just for people who work at Apple. "/>
			<outline text="Hope you had a great holiday! (Now back to work...) "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer "/>
			<outline text="PS: I've gotten some great rants from ex-Apple people, unfortunately all have been off the record. I wish people would stay on the record unless there's a real important (i.e. life-threatening) reason to be off the record. It's OK to be spontaneous, humorous, ironic, and even a little mean in email. Here's an example -- did you know that Gurshuran Sidhu's nickname is Scooby? Scooby Sidhu! If you know Professor Sidhu, or of his wild ambitions and adventures at Apple, or have sat thru one of his half-day seminars, you'll certainly appreciate the humor here. Some people may think that Sculley gave Sidhu the license to shut down the Mac networking market just to get him to shut up! And what about Roger Heinen? Why didn't he just do the honorable thing and kill himself? (Just joking, please! Roger, I hope you're happy and healthy.) "/>
			<outline text="PPS: Ironic, on-the-record public humor was tolerated long before email. A famous author, on hearing that Calvin Coolidge was dead, asked &quot;How can you tell?&quot; "/>
			<outline text="PPPS: To Peter Friedman, of Apple, quoted in Business Week complaining that Microsoft Network is anti-competitive, even though Apple bundles the Eworld client with the Mac OS: Get a life Peter. Have you no shame? Eworld is evaporating all on its own. The Eworld experience is a perfect example of how Apple can and regularly does break things that work, like AppleLink. Such bold hypocrisy! What chutzpah! "/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: I hear that Apple is simplifying the API and producing sample code for TCP/IP communication. I haven't received any info from Apple on this. Would someone please tell me what's going on? I'm getting ready to convert my software to use TCP as its transport, so it would be a very good time for us to work together. We may be re-inventing each other's wheels. "/>

			<outline text="Dave, "/>
			<outline text="While it seems that your sentiments are in the right place, there is much to disagree with in your analysis. Being the holiday season, though, I'd like to point out one area of agreement: Apple does make too big a deal out of market share, much too big a deal. "/>
			<outline text="Apple has managed to persuade developers that Macintosh may not be a viable long-term platform by setting public goals that involve gaining x% market share. The argument is that unless Mac has x% market share (x, by the way, varies depending on who you talk to), developers won't adopt the platform, the app base will shrink, customers will go elsewhere. A great argument. Please note that Apple says this about *itself*. Amazing. Apple PR sure is not what it once was! "/>
			<outline text="If Apple's argument about market share were correct, would any of the smaller automotive companies be around and would people be building parts and accessories for them? How many automakers have a 20% market share? How about in Europe? Yet, they still continue to make cars, make profits and make great technological progress. What about in the food industry? How many companies totally dominate their market segments? Why are there so many small companies doing very healthy business. Think about all the other industries you know of and ask how many companies have 20% market share. "/>
			<outline text="So, by now, people are asking &quot;Will Apple survive?&quot; While it's appropriate to ask this about Bill Clinton, the question should never been raised about Apple. I don't think anyone would be asking this had not Apple itself made an issue of market share. "/>
			<outline text="Reality check: Apple is very nearly a $10 billion company. Ten billion. 1/6 the size of General Motors. General Motors, for God's sake!!!! (OK, OK, enough of the winerian histrionics). "/>
			<outline text="It seems to be quite fashionable to give advice to Apple. Not being one who wants to be deemed out of fashion, here's my advice to Apple: "/>
			<outline text="1. Apple should stop talking about market share and start talking about number of units shipping (at an all time high, I do believe). Talk about the *real* business case for developers (new units shipped == developer $$$): &quot;Hey developers, you'll have about 1 million new potential customers this year!!!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="2. Apple should continue making the best real-world technology and should figure out how best to communicate the strengths of its products. "/>
			<outline text="3. Apple should do everything it can to help the toolsmiths create great development tools even if those tools don't come from within Mother Apple. "/>
			<outline text="4. Apple should do everything it can to help third-party developers, including continuing to work on enabling technologies. Some of these enabling technologies will be successful, some won't. If Apple stops &quot;growing&quot; the platform, developers may indeed leave. "/>
			<outline text="5. Apple should abandon the Wagnerian communications strategy they seem to have adopted. Leave eschatology to those best suited to convey it. I want to see that good ol' self-confident Apple again. "/>

			<outline text="1. First of all, I own many products, probably far too many for my own good. But although I like most of them and generally respect their manufacturers, I *love* Apple Computer. I love it for building my boyfriend's original Mac 128 and I love it for building my first Mac, an LC, and I love it even more for building my shiny new Power Mac 7100. I love it so much that I have put it in my 401(k) account, where I will count on it to grow (yes, along with other investments but damn few individual stocks) through my old age. "/>
			<outline text="2. When you let us Mac cultists get loose, we have the ability to build your business. I (not quite single-handedly but almost so) stopped my company's plan to put 386's on all the desks two and a half years ago, and we got Macs instead (over the objections of our DP guy, I might add). We feel strongly and we are loyal. "/>
			<outline text="3. Yes, you have to cultivate business users -- hell, I'm a business user! -- but you do that by working with the developers who can create the truly cool applications that we want, that will make us want Macs. Most of the executives here don't care what brand is on the box, and an astonishing number don't know for sure just what kind of machine it is that their secretaries are using. But they care what it does. "/>
			<outline text="4. I would like to continue to be a loyal Apple customer and investor for the rest of my life. Please see to it that Apple is managed in such a way as to make this both possible and meaningful. "/>
			<outline text="5. There are only two things I own that I will bend the ear of a stranger about. By far the most significant is my Mac. (The other is my Schwinn Air-Dyne exercise bike.)

All the guests left the Mac Party and went across town to the Windows party. What is Apple going to do? Hey, we're still having a party, come back?

And since you're smart and we know other smart people are reading it, we're interested in what you have to say. "/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="But most of us are pretty cynical -- even the ones of us who didn't go on to become the heads of world-famous software companies. So many of us are probably thinking, &quot;Ha! You can't fool me!&quot; We're waiting for the catch -- the message that says: &quot;Enjoy reading the newsletter? Well, from now on it's going to cost you $10 per month!&quot; or something like that. A pretty reasonable approach. "/>
			<outline text="But I have what I think is a better idea, and I'm curious if you're on to it too. "/>
			<outline text="In fact, I'm writing you this letter as an illustration of that idea: I want your feedback and that of the group's -- and I want my idea circulated. "/>
			<outline text="It's very simple. We all keep on getting the newsletter for free -- but it costs us, say, $10 to *write back*. Most of us are pretty short of time, but we're always ready to say something when other important people are listening. Sometimes, we're even humble enough to want to test our ideas against other smart (or at least knowledgeable) thinkers. "/>
			<outline text="It's the way the world is heading, Dave. There's too much noise out there anyway. The new wave is not value-added; it's garbage-subtracted. The job of the future is pr guy, not journalist. I'm too busy reading, so why should I pay for more things to read? Anything anyone didn't pay to send to me... I'm not going to read. "/>
			<outline text="Yes, in a world full of content and advertising and pr, I still want to know what your friends and mine are thinking, but I want only what they think is so good that they'll pay to have me read it -- because they honestly believe it will raise their stature in my eyes. "/>
			<outline text="And Dave, watch out -- because if you let the quality of the group go down, not only will I not pay to read what they say, but I won't particularly want their attention for what I have to say -- or pay for *that*. So you can't let the list get too large and let every Tom, Dick and Harry in there; I need to know that my words will be among a carefully selected amount of mail that's not too much for even the busiest person to read. "/>
			<outline text="So what's the purpose of *this* letter? Basically, I'm going to see if I can get some paper publication to use it -- along with whatever feedback it gets from your list (with those writers' permission -- which I'm sure they will grant). Ironically, such a publication will probably pay me a small amount, even though I or indeed almost any author would gladly let, say, the Journal or the Times print his article for free (should I get so lucky). "/>
			<outline text="Again, I just want the idea to be noticed -- not paid for. I make my money other ways: These comments may draw attention to my newsletter (still charged for the old way, I blush) or my conference, or maybe they'll help me win a lucrative speaking engagement. Our old ideas about intellectual property are going to be revised in a world where content is abundant and rich people's attention is increasingly scarce... Maybe Steven King will post his books on the Internet -- and start charging for readings. University professors publish works basically for free, and make money by teaching and by giving their institutions respectability with their names. Already some software companies are distributing software for free and charging for support. Consultants publish free newsletters in order to win clients. And as John Perry Barlow loves to point out, the Grateful Dead let you tape their concerts, but they charge you to attend. "/>
			<outline text="So, Dave, you can copy this freely. I'll even pay you the $10 if you tell me where to send the check (or how to do it over the Internet). But make sure you keep my name attached! "/>
			<outline text="Yours, "/>
			<outline text="Esther Dyson "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Thanks for the comments, Esther! "/>
			<outline text="I usually don't comment on other people's pieces, but I'll make an exception in this case. "/>
			<outline text="1. There's no charge for the essays, nor is there a charge to comment or circulate ideas, nor will there be in the future. "/>
			<outline text="2. The only guarantee that an essay is interesting is that I thought it was interesting. "/>
			<outline text="If I'm wrong on a regular basis, I expect to get mass resignations from the group. So far it hasn't happened. (Whew!) "/>
			<outline text="I select essays that I think are interesting in their own right, or interesting because the person who's talking is basically an interesting person. Sometimes you get both! For example, Jean-Louis Gassee's comments on PDAs. He was quotable even if his comments weren't so informed and well-stated, because JLG is fundamentally an interesting person. "/>
			<outline text="I'm totally happy about the way it's going. A steady stream of new subscriptions, and the people are increasingly diverse. It started out with a group selected from the attendee list of your conference and Stewart's, and my rolodex, but over time the group has broadened to include people from all walks of life, with the common denominator that at least part of their lives are lived on-line. At this point, it's still a very high-powered, highly concentrated group of influential people. "/>
			<outline text="If the thing continues to grow, the distribution will grow beyond email, using other kinds of software. And that's where my interest lies. I'm a software developer (but you knew that!) and this little chatnet thing is a testbed for making sure that a new piece of software is relevent when it ships. When I did ThinkTank I needed to be organized -- so I was, kind of. (I'm not the world's most organized person.) When I did MORE, I had to learn about presentations, so I did a lot of them. For Frontier, I became a script writer. "/>
			<outline text="I belong to the Necessity is the Mother of Invention school of software design. If a software baby (pre-alpha 1.0) is to become a successful adult, it has to grow up being used for what it was intended to be used for. It sounds obvious, but a lot of software comes from *clean room* design shops. Marketing guys write the spec. Programmers write the code. Untouched by human hands. Usability labs. (Yuck!) You can tell when you use this kind of software. I believe the truly great products are ones that had a purpose, and were fit to that purpose while they were being created, and were developed by people who practice the art the product was intended to support. "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, for the next product I needed to be the moderator of an online talk show. Perhaps this time I've found my calling? I love this stuff, it's a great combination of technology and politics. I've found that I'm happiest when you turn up the volume on both of these things. So I'm happy. "/>
			<outline text="[By the way, trying to be organized turned out to be a good thing, but I don't think I'll ever be a presenter, at least not in the boardroom sense, nor will I ever be truly organized. But I will always be a script writer, and I think I will always be a sysop.] "/>
			<outline text="The business model: I get to own a hot new piece of software if all goes well, and the software industry gets a new voice, and hopefully a platform for new voices. I think it's a win-win. Maybe a win-win-win. Or client-client-server? (It's a floor polish too!) "/>
			<outline text="Finally, if you like, please send $10 to a worthy charity. We could do it that way. Tis the season! "/>
			<outline text="And one more time, thanks Esther! Your thought-provoking insights and commentary are always welcome here. "/>

			<outline text="***Re: &quot;Visions of Platform Vendors&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Why is it that platform vendors are always striving to be what they are not? "/>
			<outline text="Microsft Windows is primarily a business operating system, very successful in the office, but a disaster in the home, because unfortunately, most homes don't have MIS departments. Yet, Microsoft spends money on TV advertising asking consumers where they want to go. "/>
			<outline text="If consumers are smart, they will go to Apple. At least you can install Macintosh hardware and applications with a minimum amount of fuss. But for some reason, Apple, the creator of the computer for the &quot;rest of us,&quot; is aligning with IBM and Motorola for an offensive on the business market. "/>
			<outline text="If Windows wins in the consumer market, the consumer will rebel because of ease of use. Apple is the consumer's only hope. "/>
			<outline text="I hate the Windows platform, as a guy who markets consumer software. If the consumer has a problem with SimCity 2000 they call us, we tell the consumer that it is a hardware problem (and it usually is). So they call the hardware folks, who have horrible support staffs, mostly because the consumer is a tightwad and bought the cheapest junk hardware made in Bulgaria. And Microsoft and Intel make money in this environment. "/>
			<outline text="In my school days I learned that a dissatisfied customer talks to 14 people on average about the experience, and you must be on another planet if you haven't heard people bitch about Windows. "/>
			<outline text="The next big market by most accounts is the consumer market. And the #1 demand by Mom &amp; Pop in Montana is ease of use. Apple wins hands down here. Why is it that Bandai is building a $500 Mac? Why isn't Apple setting the standard for the low end computer? What is needed is cross platform data and hardware compatibility. From the Newton to the Performa and up. This licensing thing can be good if it keeps everyone in line, but there might be problems lurking, look at 3DO. "/>
			<outline text="3DO licensed their platform (like Apple to Bandai) to Panasonic. When they licensed the platform they gave up control of the features of the final device to Panasonic. The original 3DO was short of RAM and had no storage. 3DO would have been better off doing the manufacturing for the first year or two then licensing a proven success. By giving up control of the device, 3DO's fate was in the manufacturer's hands. This loss of control, more than anything else, caused the lack of success of 3DO. "/>
			<outline text="Apple should take the consumer market seriously and build a series of platforms from $200 on up that are all plug and data compatible. Give up the office focus and aim for the home. This is where the action will be in the next 10 years. The battle for the home has just begun. Once a platform is stable it can be licensed to create lower cost alternatives. "/>
			<outline text="A stable platform will be key in the consumer market. If Microsoft releases a new operating system every year consumers will panic. This will create an opportunity for Apple to become an oasis where life is calm and stable. "/>
			<outline text="Someday Apple will wake up and find out that Steve Jobs's vision of the Mac as a closed toaster box was not far off from what the ultimate consumer platform will be. Once again Steve was a little ahead of his time. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/4/94; 9:04:47 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The vision thing came up again. This time the controversy is about Mike Spindler, CEO of Apple, and the forum was Wednesday's New York Times, and the henchman was John Markoff (who you have to totally admire for keeping Spindler on the record as he compared desktop computers to urinals.) "/>
			<outline text="Spindler says that &quot;vision&quot; was highly over-rated in the past at Apple (how true!) and apparently Spindler's reaction to this situation is to not have a vision. Uh oh. "/>
			<outline text="This calls us back to the early days of Lou Gerstner at IBM and an article that appeared in Fortune (I think, my memory is blurry) that took him apart for his proclamation that vision was unnecessary for the CEO of a high-tech company. I think he was actually trying to position himself against Bill Gates, he probably thought he was being clever, but he was wrong, the vision of a high-tech CEO is absolutely essential to the viability of the company he or she is CEO of. "/>
			<outline text="How can you tell? Check out the piece in the current issue of Business Week (12/5/94, p 100) entitled &quot;IBM Swings into the Fast Lane.&quot; The article could have been more accurately entitled &quot;IBM is in Panic Mode Because Lou Gerstner Had No Idea Where the World Was Headed Two Years Ago and is Scrambling to Own a Piece of a Market He Should Have Dominated.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="The article says that IBM has no coherent strategy for offering wide-area network services to users of personal computers. They are in reaction mode, again, and surprise, they're reacting to Bill Gates, the CEO of a high-tech company who bothers to have a vision. "/>
			<outline text="The world is totally screwed up! It isn't that Microsoft is so damned smart, it's that everyone else is so damned stupid! Couldn't they see this coming? Why didn't they ask me? [Fortune *did* ask Bill Gates, back then, and he called it right -- he told the post-Akers IBM to focus on services and networking.] "/>
			<outline text="Now let's swing forward to a few months ago, to a cover story in Fortune, written by Alan Deutschman, a subscriber, and a friend. It painted a very rosy picture of Mr. Gerstner as the electrifying and creative leader of IBM. How electrifying? When he was on a tour of some random IBM facility and asked a worker what he was working on, the answer was &quot;platforms.&quot; Gerstner's response was something like &quot;well, whatever a platform is, be sure you do a good job!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I'm sorry I don't have the exact quote. But really, it was *that* inane. "/>
			<outline text="Can you imagine the president of a high-tech company that isn't totally *immersed* in what a platform is all about? And how his or her platforms are doing? I cannot. Maybe I'm off the wall. Please tell me if you think I am. "/>
			<outline text="Would you bet on an airline whose president didn't love to fly? A winery whose president didn't love wine? A book publisher that didn't read an awful lot of books? Why should anyone expect success from a platform vendor that doesn't bother to learn what makes a platform work? Or (bringing it back to Spindler) a high tech CEO that doesn't have a vision of the future? "/>
			<outline text="It could be that Spindler is simply ineloquent. I'm hoping for the best, and that what he really means is that heli-cars, like Taligent and Newton (and on and on...) were harmful noise because they distracted people from the real stuff, and he's going to keep that kind of stuff quiet in his version of Apple, and focus on the businesses that pay the bills, like graphic production, productivity apps, multimedia titles, games and electronic mail and great hardware.

			<outline text="Having lots of fun here... Getting great essays from the readers of this net. That's allowed me to spend more time with the software. It feels like I'm coming up two sides of the same mountain at the same time, from the content side (the part that you can see) and from the technology side (the part that's still in development)."/>
			<outline text="Here are comments from Amanda Hixson, Dan Farber, Randy Battat, Ted Leonsis, Stephanie J. Vardavas, Don Norman and Jeffrey Henning. "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Amanda Hixson, IDG, amanda_hixson@infoworld.com"/>
			<outline text="I think Spindler admitting a lack of vision is probably better than some former Apple top-dogs who were labeled visionaries by the press and bought into the hype when the reality was that they couldn't have had a vision if they had eaten a pound of peyote."/>
			<outline text="***Dan Farber, editor-in-chief, PC WEEK, 364-5972@mcimail.com"/>
			<outline text="Markoff's story was revealing. Spindler is an interesting interview. He has a vision... it is very practical -- focus on core business, figure out licensing, give Dave Winer more users to sell to and help Esther avoid junk mail. Apple is into set top, interactive, Internet, on line services, system software, objects and deals.... but the first priority is to build confidence in the platform -- sell lots of PowerMacs. "/>
			<outline text="Apple and IBM simply aren't as good or as focused or powerful or visionary as Microsoft -- and MS still acts like a starved tiger searching for food. Apple and IBM don't have the guerilla marketing attitude that is required to do battle in the marketplace with MS. Yet. IBM is like a huge ocean liner that needs to move like an America Cup yacht. Gerstner and company probably have too many visions and they don't cohere. Gerstner has salvaged the stock for now, but they are still slow, reactionary and dealing with too many internal conflicts. It would help if the vision were clear and not a moving target, or that the CEO and CTO shared a brain, but not so."/>
			<outline text="***Ted Leonsis, president, America On-Line, leonsis@aol.com"/>
			<outline text="I totally agree, and don't understand why Apple is running business oriented ads when more PCs are being shipped into the home than televisions. Must be that vision thing you were talking about yesterday. [Ted also had some interesting things to say about Microsoft Network, they'll run in a later piece.]"/>
			<outline text="***Stephanie J. Vardavas, ProServ, vard@well.com"/>
			<outline text="Dave, I don't mean to jump up on my soapbox again, but the missing piece of info here is that *many, many* home computer buyers want the same kind of box they have at work. Home computer buying decisions are not made in a vacuum. Apple would be much better off if they were!"/>
			<outline text="***Jeffrey Henning, 74774.157@compuserve.com"/>
			<outline text="The Mac is much easier to use, and the interfaces of the applications tend to be of much higher quality, as Mac developers usually have been developing for the GUI longer than Windows developers."/>
			<outline text="***Randy Battat, Motorola, battat@wes.mot.com"/>
			<outline text="While I've avoided most of the Apple dialogue, I feel compelled to contribute to the &quot;vision&quot; thing."/>
			<outline text="It's very sad Michael Spindler is quoted as saying he's against &quot;vision.&quot;  All companies must have a sense of purpose and direction in order to survive. Their stakeholders -- customers, developers, employees, shareholders -- want to know what the place stands for and where it's going. This overarching direction is, by definition, based on a point of view about the future."/>
			<outline text="That said, I'm sure that Spindler was reacting to what he perceives as industry over-hype and that the company does have a sense of its direction. Toning down the hype *is* appropriate. But Apple shouldn't have to oppose the future when it opposes Gates and Grove. There is a difference between delcaring that a new product will create the &quot;mother of all markets&quot; and expressing a point of view of how a company will create value for its constituencies."/>
			<outline text="Apple has been articulating a more compelling view of the future than its competitors for almost 20 years. Given such a deep rooted tradition, I'm sure this article captured more about the momentary frustrations of a CEO than a change in the DNA of an organism."/>
			<outline text="***Don Norman, Apple Computer, dnorman@applelink.apple.com"/>
			<outline text="Don't worry.  Spindler is *not* Gerstner. His line refers to the fact that all vision and no action is deadly. Moreover, in the past  year, the most important thing for Apple was to get its act together -- stop visioning and get focused. We did that.  Now it is time for a focused vision. And we have it."/>

			<outline text="Dave:"/>
			<outline text="I don't disagree with a lot of what you said (and I read the Markoff piece--on-line!), but I think CEO vision and passion are two very different things. Not only that, there are two major types of passion that I've seen in the business world."/>
			<outline text="Passion Number One is passion for what your company is doing today and has in the chute for delivery in the next six months. You can see this in the CEOs who can actually demo their company's products to a stranger (or on a computer TV show) to make a sale. If he were an Apple CEO, he'd be carrying a Newton in his pocket, a PowerBook Duo 280c in his briefcase, and a PowerMac 8100/100 at work. If he were a Microsoft CEO, he'd use Beta 2 of Windows 95 as his productivity OS today, and would be active on Microsoft Network."/>
			<outline text="Passion Number Two is a passion for business, independent of whatever is being made or sold. This kind of CEO is enamored with The Deal, management structure, stockholders, and so on. As I cite in my upcoming book, they make alliances and mergers without knowing what's going on in either company's labs or cultures to know that the joint body could even work together (e.g., all those RBOC/cable fiascos of earlier this year)."/>
			<outline text="To follow up on your example, they run computer platform companies, and don't know what platforms are. Today he or she leads a widget company; without Passion Number One, however, tomorrow it may be a gizmo company."/>
			<outline text="My personal view is that a candidate for a successful CEO is one who has all of the above. There are many such folks out there in our industry leading and working in companies large and small (Bill Gates being the most visible, but not in any way the Lone Ranger)."/>
			<outline text="As for Michael Spindler, I doubt you can be the Apple veteran he is without some of that vision thing rubbing off on you. My guess is that he chooses to emphasize the other two parts of my success equation."/>

			<outline text="As has been pointed out, X.25 was an unqualified commercial success, even though many folks, such as AT&amp;T, could never figure out how to build a profitable VAN."/>
			<outline text="And, so far, the Internet is an unqualified commercial flop (despite some newly wealthy ISPs). Furthermore, since no one has yet figured out how to commercialize activities like *com-priv* (which remain the heart of the Internet as a culture), the future of commercialization of the net itself doesn't look great. And, why should it?"/>
			<outline text="We, netizens, have been duped. Who says the Internet has to succeed commercially? Just because Al Gore (remember him?) says we need an NII and alot of folks felt good about being on a big-deal bandwagon doesn't make any of the hoopla right (i.e. correct or righteous). In fact, judging from whence these ideas have come, current notions of a &quot;successful&quot; Internet should be severely distrusted."/>
			<outline text="The shift from &quot;subsidized&quot; to &quot;commercial&quot; operation of the Internet's plumbing has been going on for a long time and will simply take its course. Expecting internetworking bandwidth to become so expensive that it will kill all this idle chatter (oops, culture) is paranoid and unrealistic. Expecting it to become a hugely profitable business also flies in the face of the increasingly commodity character of leased lines and packet engines."/>
			<outline text="But trying to accommodate mass-market videophones with TCP/IP is just silly. Circuit switched ISDN based vidphones (i.e. non-Internet) will become very widespread long before ATM becomes a widely deployed network reality. The *Internet* cannot and should not be expected to do everything (or even most things)."/>
			<outline text="Except, of course, save the planet. Come on friends! The Internet is a research network. It's design is best suited for the purpose it's designers intended. Research. We are all participating in the experiment of inventing Cyberspace. There's a plausible arguement to be made that after 3000 years of death and destruction, Realspace problems can only be &quot;solved&quot; from the perspective of Cyberspace. Get with the program. Do some research."/>
			<outline text="Invent some new media. Read McLuhan about &quot;broadcasting consciousness.&quot; Do some &quot;future sociology.&quot; Figure out what Toffler meant by the &quot;psycho-sphere.&quot; Start a conspiracy. Join DigitaLiberty. Get Real. Get Webbed (said the spider to the...)."/>

			<outline text="PS: ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. Mark is right, some ISPs are getting rich. But there are still big opportunities in this area. VCs: contact me for details (I don't want to start this business, but I need a good one here in the valley, and would be happy to pay for the service). I think there's a Compaq-style opportunity here. "/>

			<outline text="Does the Internet have to become a system for commerce in order for it to have a place in our world? Can you imagine a world that the Internet is *not* part of? In other words, can you imagine a global network that isn't compatible with TCP/IP? That doesn't have webs and web browsers? Shoot! No way. Will it keep growing? Of course. What's the big deal anyway?"/>
			<outline text="The greedy VCs want to make money, as usual. It's their job. I suppose somebody's got to do it. But does it *have* to be thru electronic shopping? No way! [Finally I get to the point.]"/>

			<outline text="***THE ONLINE STOCK BROKER"/>
			<outline text="Does anyone know a stock broker who is online, has an email account, and checks it regularly? If so, please give him or her my email account (dwiner@well.com). I want to do some deals at the end of the year. I'm going to have to play phone tag with my broker for the next week or so to get the info I need to make my decision. Why can't I do this via email? Because stock brokers don't have email accounts! Oh man. [I'm not a fax man, sorry.]"/>
			<outline text="I also want a local real estate agent I can email with."/>
			<outline text="We already have a net that's really good at connecting people to people. We just need more people. And with more people, we're going to want some more software and some new services. [There's hope for the VCs!]"/>
			<outline text="I predict that the first stock broker you can email with is going to make a few million in commissions the first year he or she is online. And probably a few million every year after that. Then *every* broker is going to rush to get online. It's a business that *begs* to be converted to the superhighway. But instead of moving around truckloads of money, the highway is going to be moving around ideas."/>

			<outline text="***THE ONLINE CASH REGISTER IS OK"/>
			<outline text="It's OK to have an online cash register. But realize that this is an experiment. We already know that people-to-people connections are greatly enhanced by tag-less and paper-less electronic links. We don't know that people want to shop thru their computer.

			<outline text="***THE NET-NET OF THE NET FOR THE GREEDY VCS"/>
			<outline text="Focus on building services and software that make it easy for the *people* of businesses to be connected with the people of the world. It has to be much easier to set up a new service. We need a Compaq of ISPs, and no, I don't believe AT&amp;T and PacBell, etc are going to figure out how to do this on their own. They'll buy the Compaq, or invest in it, or ally with it, or whatever. It has to be entrepreneurial at first. You'll win if you bet on setting up this Compaq style company, it emphasizes professionalism, reliability and thruput, and followup. A lot of businesses want to get online, and many more are going to want to."/>
			<outline text="Along with the Compaq, there needs to be a Lotus, right? I know, you guys think it's Netscape Inc. I don't. They're too thin. Not enough technology. Too many pieces missing. Maybe they can acquire them. Something richer and deeper is needed to make it really fly, and it's got to be *much* easier for businesses to get on the air, and it has to be much better at connecting people to people. That's where I'm putting my money."/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="It's cool when a group-of-eight takes off from a topic, a discussion builds and a great passionate essay comes out of it."/>
			<outline text="One of those essays was the result of a dialog between Jeff Braun (CEO of Maxis and the author of the SimPlatformVendor piece, released on Sunday December 4) and John R. Sumser, jrsumser@well.sf.ca.us. "/>
			<outline text="The subject of this thread is &quot;My Mom's Computer,&quot; written by John. He has already written two essays, and promises a third. "/>
			<outline text="Here's the first essay, entitled &quot;Build My Mom A Computer.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Jeff:"/>
			<outline text="I'm going to take you up on your challenge to define a set of features for MMC (My Mother's Computer). I really like your idea of posing a grand challenge to the platform vendors. I passionately believe in accelerating the rate of diffusion in our culture."/>
			<outline text="On the way to a features spec, I'm going to take an important detour."/>
			<outline text="MMC would compete in a market that provides extraordinary goods. For $350, you can get a machine that will reliably and easily clean all of your clothes for ten to fifteen years. For the same money, you can get a device that will preserve your food.  For $700, you can transport the greatest musicians of the world into your living room. These are incredible improvements in life quality and set the 'value' standards."/>
			<outline text="Benefits, not features, drive purchasing behavior. &quot;What does this thing do for me?&quot;, not, &quot;What does this thing do?&quot; In my years of managing design processes, this distinction always seems to get lost in the excitement. When I look at a troubled design team, this is the first area that I diagnose. It's what I meant when I said that the engineers and managers have siezed complete control of the industry. The current focus is on features, not benefits. "/>
			<outline text="Features are best described in quantifiable performance terms. Benefits are values. I've found that they are best described the way that value is always transmitted: stories, examples, visions and scenarios. I'd propose describing the MMC's benefits and then mapping features on to them."/>
			<outline text="So, with your indulgence, I'd like to tell you three or four stories over the next day or so. I  know that you're busy, so I'll make every effort to keep them compact.  "/>
			<outline text="***Story 1:  My Family's Learning Curve"/>
			<outline text="Kate, my four year old, has been using a Macintosh since well before she could speak. She's learned some spanish, counting, the alphabet and pattern matching."/>
			<outline text="Raymond, my nine year old, has been using a Macintosh since he was 6. He delights in the ability to create, pixel by pixel, original art. [Nintendo and Sega, though, have taught him to think in levels.]"/>
			<outline text="Bridget, my eleven year old, is a writer and email junkie. The Mac has removed any sense of the fear of adults from her life. If she wants to know something from you, and she gets your email address, she'll send you a note. Email gave her the skills to march into Stewart Brand's boat-office and declare &quot;I hear you're a writer. Tell me what I need to do.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Colleen, my wife, was a complete technophobe during most of the decade she spent at home raising the kids. This morning, she told me that she was going to get a copy of the database used in her new office. One of her great accomplishments this past year was developing her organization's budget, from scratch, in Excel.  "/>
			<outline text="Each of them has more self confidence and an increased ability to think independently because of their self-directed learnings on their Macs. Each member of my family is the most computer literate person in their daily worlds."/>
			<outline text="Colleen credits this transformation to my oft repeated insistences that &quot;there's nothing you can break on a Mac&quot;. She marvels at the parents who invest $2K in a machine for their kids and then protectively hover. The learning curve is so mistake-intensive that they prevent learning by trying to protect their investment."/>
			<outline text="Game machines are a good example of the opposite of this dynamic. For the most part, kids are given game machines. The only parental involvement is a very straightforward set up. Quickly, the kid becomes the expert. Any parental worry about breakage is eliminated the first several times the machine crashes to the floor because the cables are too short."/>
			<outline text="I'm reminded of the technical evolution of cameras over the past 20 years. Camera stores make their money on photofinishing which costs a half penny per picture and sells for 6 or seven cents. To get people interested in the hobby, they used to guarantee that if you broke the camera, they'd replace it for free. Decades of this practice have resulted in unbreakable high quality cameras. The entire industry takes for granted the idea that &quot;more pictures taken equals more cameras sold&quot;."/>
			<outline text="So, the first benefits that need to be a part of MMC are: ">
				<outline text="1. It's unbreakable."/>
				<outline text="2. It's mine."/>
				<outline text="3. It helps me do something I enjoy doing or have to do. "/>
				<outline text="4. I learn from it. "/>
				<outline text="5. It makes me feel better about myself. "/>
				<outline text="6. It makes me want to use it."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="I asked John to write a brief bio for this piece. Here's what he came up with: "/>
			<outline text="&quot;I probably qualify as an Itinerant Visionary. I've variously: taught frigate design to the Chinese and automotive manufacturing in Jordan; built cross-disciplinary design teams; designed and sold databases to NATO; and managed large complex electronics development projects. My most recent &quot;job&quot; was editing and redesigning both Whole Earth Review and the organization that creates it. Currently, I'm directing a proposal for a major environmental remediation project and writing about technology and strategy. I like to chew on and simplify intractable problems.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="***Story 2:  Microsoft Word 6.0"/>
			<outline text="I have been a committed Microsoft Word fan since I switched from DOS to Mac machines in the late 80s. I was really excited by the features of Word 6: integrated grammar checker, revision control, PageMaker-like kerning, real DOS compatibility.  "/>
			<outline text="Then I started using it about six weeks ago. My PowerBook runs at 33 mhz yet this monster word processor crawls along more slowly than any I've used in fifteen years. It's not like I'm doing complex rendering. The neat-sounding features turn out to be bugs. It thinks for me in ways I wish it didn't. And, fully configured, it takes almost 10% of my hard disk. And, it loses files. And, transfering files to a DOS Word 6 machine doesn't work. And, and, and..."/>
			<outline text="I wonder if Microsoft understands the consequences of doing this to me? Besides crimping my personal productivity, I've become an unhappy customer. Once dissatisfied, I started noticing the bugs that I'd never have seen. I've already told my average fourteen friends about how crummy it is. Plus, I'll be much slower to buy the next product. I'm unhappy."/>
			<outline text="Ordinarily, I'm so delighted with Mac software that I act as a regional missionary. I have the zeal of a religious convert. In the last eight years, I've standardized four organizations on Macs with Microsoft products. I'll have to think about it the next time."/>
			<outline text="I dislike paying to be treated like a beta test site. It would stop my Mom from using her computer."/>
			<outline text="So, some additional MMC benefits should be: ">
				<outline text="7. It's a delight to use."/>
				<outline text="8. It always delivers more than it promises."/>
				<outline text="9. It's something you want to tell your friends about."/>

			<outline text="***Story 3:  The cross country trips and SimCity"/>
			<outline text="This morning my four year old dragged me into our son's room to play SimCity on the Nintendo. She'd figured out how to get a bank and a park. Her city was forrested and growing at a population of 20,000. Together, we could sit on the couch and watch her city come to life."/>
			<outline text="It reminded me of the three week cross country camping trip my kids and I took when we moved to California 18 months ago."/>
			<outline text="My PowerBook served two major functions on that trip. We loaded it with games and software to keep the kids entertained. Then, at night or long stops, I was writing 'postcards' to a lengthy email list."/>
			<outline text="The software that was most effective on the trip was stuff I knew intimately. When one of the kids hit a trouble spot, they could tell me in sufficient detail so that I could visualize the problem. I could troubleshoot most problems from the driver's seat without slowing down."/>
			<outline text="The mailing list was another story. We started with 15 friends and relatives on the list. As the trip progressed, the list grew to over 200 names. The back and forth email, coupled with new names provided insight and entertainment for all of us in the car."/>
			<outline text="We soon discovered that you can get online from almost any truckstop on the interstates. Truck drivers are pretty automated these days. We made a contest out of how remote we could be and still get on line."/>
			<outline text="The best email was a set of files from my brother (we all use Eudora) that included a GIFF of us just prior to leaving and a reader for it.  We received it at Tonapah Joe's, a truckstop in the middle of the Arizona desert."/>
			<outline text="This wraps my stories about features. The final additions to the list are: ">
				<outline text="10. Makes communicationg with others easy."/>
				<outline text="11. Work in progress can be shared and understood by others. "/>
				<outline text="12. I can carry it around (may be optional)."/>

			<outline text="Intel's problems go way back. The processor that put them on the map for most people was the 8088 (also available as the 8086.) People ranting and raving over Intel's handling of the Pentium floating point bug don't realize that Intel's method of dealing with problems in this fashion dates all the way back to this first processor."/>
			<outline text="The 8088 was released with a serious flaw in it. This flaw would cause your computer to destroy data and/or freeze up. For the techinically inclined I'm talking about the problem of the missing interlock on loading the SS register."/>
			<outline text="Intel never replaced any chips I know of and to this day anyone coding software that might run on a 8088 class computer has to put a software work-around in their code. I've had to put this code in many times myself."/>
			<outline text="But perhaps the biggest sin that Intel is finally paying for was their next x86 processor: the 80286. Most people screaming about the Pentium flaw don't realize that it was incredibly serious flaws in the 80286 processor that cemented DOS as the OS for PC's. Bugs in the 286's protect mode resulted I believe in DRI being finally taken off the scene as a serious OS vendor. They had gambled on being the protect mode OS for PCs, but alas the 286 couldn't run it. Many people have written about a magic plane flight the decided that DOS would be the OS for PCs. I think instead it was a group of Intel engineers that made DOS the OS for PCs."/>
			<outline text="After the fiasco with the 286, Intel did much better with the 386. Here they wound up with only one serious public bug, the infamous &quot;Double Sigma&quot; stamp came to be an all important factor when purchasing 386 processors for many folks. "/>
			<outline text="Then we have the 486. Alas I'm in the biz. As such I'm under NDA to Intel. I can't tell you what I know about 486 processors. All I can do is refer you to Andy's Internet posting and nod my head up and down quickly."/>
			<outline text="And then we have the Pentium. The bill finally comes due and it's shaping up as a $1 billion bill. One thing that the general public should note though is that Intel has only gone public on one flaw in the Pentium. If you go back and read what Intel has said about the Pentium you'll notice something interesting, there are other bugs being fixed in the new chips. Those other bugs are still under NDA protection."/>
			<outline text="Andy may have appeared to have come clean of late, but they're still hiding problems with current Pentiums behind their NDAs."/>
			<outline text="Dave, I think they still haven't gotten it yet. I'm expecting big things from the P6 if you know what I mean. :) I'm also just waiting with baited breath for the press to finish what they've started by asking about the other Pentium bugs and &quot;Hey what about those 486 chips you folks make?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The Intel 486 bugs really piss me off. Intel played stupid until we were able to prove it was the Intel part causing the problem. They then sent us a document under NDA which revealed they had known of the problem since April of 1993 (it was then November 1994.)"/>
			<outline text="The fascinating thing was that we had all the major BIOSs. Intel's &quot;fix&quot; for the problem was a software hack in the BIOS. Neither AMI, Phoenix, or SystemSoft knew about the problem. One of my tasks right now is to hack the work around into our SystemSoft BIOS (and hopefully sell the hack back to SystemSoft.)"/>
			<outline text="How in God's name can Intel sleep at night I ask? They've got a serious bug in the chip that causes it to crash and they don't even make sure the BIOS suppliers put the work-around into the BIOS code! (or evidently even make them aware of it...) Perhaps the computer maker fixes it, or maybe they just write it off to unstable Microsoft Windows code. We didn't find the problem right away ourselves, it's kinda hard to provoke due to the nature of it."/>
			<outline text="But wait, it gets worse!"/>
			<outline text="Intel &quot;fixed&quot; the problem in a newer stepping of the 486. This is what allowed us to prove it was an Intel problem. We started soldering some of the newer chips into our units and when we went back to take another wack at fixing the problem we discovered units that worked a lot better than when last we had looked into the problem."/>
			<outline text="We can still make the newer chips fail though. But it's real hard, your usual Windows user, who spends most of his/her time playing Solitare won't encounter the problem. Compile 10 megabytes of source code though and boom! You basically have to get the box busy."/>
			<outline text="But wait, it gets even worse!"/>
			<outline text="Intel still has both parts in the pipeline! We got a shipment of chips in November 1994 and got both flavors. Intel is purging the buggy parts by selling them mixed in with the good chips. Are they hoping to spread the bad chips around so no one notices the problem??? Enquiring minds want to know! :)"/>
			<outline text="All I can tell you is to tell yer press friends to ask Intel for their problem reports on SB80486SX-25 parts with the following S-SPECs: SX765, the bad part, SX854 the better part. (S-SPEC is the Stepping Specification, sort of like a version number.)"/>
			<outline text="The problem revolves around the STPCLK pin causing a stack corruption (we figured this much our before we went NDA so I can tell you that much.) The stack corruption will cause interesting things to happen, DOS windows under Microsoft Windows 3.11 will spontaneously close with no error message for example. Borland C++ Compilers will crash under MS-DOS 6.22."/>
			<outline text="But only if you stumble into the right timing on the STPCLK pin, i.e. it occurs randomly. The compile works one time, croaks the next."/>
			<outline text="Please tell your press friends that if they want to use my name I need to check their article to make sure they got it right. This is a highly technical problem and I'd hate for them to miss the target with my name all over it."/>
			<outline text="As for the 8086/8 and 286/386 problems, they're common knowledge. No NDA required. The 8086/8 screwup is even documented in learning-how-to-write Intel-assembly-code books. One of their fuckups becomes something you teach younger programmers about..."/>
			<outline text="The press can also talk to companies like Quarterdeck, the makers of QEMM. This product for example checks your 286 to see if it's one of the &quot;bad&quot; 286's. If it is you can't do certain things with QEMM (Intel did eventually make good 286 chips.) And I'm sure Microsoft has code in Windows 3.1 to check for &quot;bad&quot; 286's as well..."/>
			<outline text="And of course there might still be some folks to interview at Novell who worked for DRI. I'm sure they'd be happy to talk about how Intel pretty much killed their company (DRI never really did recover from the 286 fiasco.)"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, all the above is why I laughed so hard the first time I saw the Pentium bug featured on Headline News. Intel finally got nailed, but it was for a stupid stupid stupid problem. I just keep seeing this mental movie of Andy and folks sitting around going &quot;Hell why are they busting our chops about this problem? This is nothing compared to what else we've done to our users!&quot; I still get a chuckle just thinking about it. Puts a smile on my face every time I overhear someone talking about how they've gotta get their Pentium chip swapped out."/>

			<outline text="Thanks Scotty! I have a few things to add..."/>
			<outline text="First, I don't buy the idea that it's OK to ship inferior hardware to people (such as myself) who know how a computer works on the inside. There's been a sea-change in the computer business, sure we have a lot of Moms and Dads buying computers now, but product quality is an issue, a big one, no matter who you're selling to."/>
			<outline text="Second point: inevitably, this story raises questions about other chip vendors, clonemakers,  system software vendors, even application and utility software companies. Everyone should take a very detailed look at their product quality issues. It seems like now is the time to come clean."/>
			<outline text="And Intel should change their policies, if appropriate, to provide full public disclosure of any problems with any of its products, at the time the problem is first discovered. This new policy should be implemented immediately, and it should be communicated, on a personal level, by the top guy at Intel. "/>
			<outline text="A couple of stories --"/>
			<outline text="My grandfather, Rudy Kiesler, who used to run a garment business (a big one, a very rough industry) gave me some advice when I started my first company back in the early 80s. He said &quot;pay for your sins.&quot; At first I didn't understand what he meant. Then I did, when customers started having problems with our product, and we reacted arrogantly. You can't avoid paying for mistakes, but you *can* postpone the paying. But when the bill finally comes due, you end up paying a much bigger price. "/>
			<outline text="That's what's going on at Intel right now. They're paying the bigger price. How much bigger? If Scotty is right, a much, much bigger price than anyone could have imagined. Potentially a Watergate-style price."/>
			<outline text="I read a story last week in the Washington Post about a quality problem that AT&amp;T had. Service had gone out in the NY metropolitan area. At a press conference, the chairman of AT&amp;T was asked who was to blame. He said (not an exact quote) &quot;As far as our customers are concerned, I am.&quot; What a beautiful attitude! He put all AT&amp;T employees on notice -- if we screw up, I'm going to take the heat personally. If I worked for AT&amp;T, I'd be damned sure to take care of the customers first. And he went a step further, he reduced the rates for all long distance calls on Valentine's Day to pay for their sin. They took their money and applied it to love! So much for big companies not having big hearts."/>
			<outline text="Intel has shown that its customers don't come first. Intel does not have a big heart. Very reluctantly, gradually, indecisively, it is willing to pay for its sins. Listening to all the noise on the airways, it's not clear what or who comes first for Intel. "/>
			<outline text="It's time for Intel to speak, clearly, decisively, own up to whatever sins it has committed, and pay for them, now. Clean it up. Say what Intel stands for. That's the only way to put this Pentium stuff behind them and be part of the future of this industry. "/>
			<outline text="Intel's philosophy is in question. And so is the philosophy of this industry."/>

			<outline text="Dear David Winer:"/>
			<outline text="Holiday Greetings -- finally an insightful piece full of facts!!"/>
			<outline text="Oh is Scott Turner right!"/>
			<outline text="I have been at that place in end of the 1970's for a couple of years, listening already to the sirens of P1---P7 while there was still a scramble to respond to the threats of Zilog's Z80 with its SIO channel. The answer to that was a rushed out 8085 and a subsequent marketing blitz called &quot;Operation crush&quot; around the 8086,  masterminded by Regis McKenna (and not Grove). Sounds familiar? Is there a pattern? Makes you indeed wonder what we get with P6 or subsequent things."/>
			<outline text="You are right -- what is at stake here is the reputation of this industry. And who defines it? When I read written pieces titled &quot;benevolent dictators&quot; tears come into my eyes."/>
			<outline text="I absolutely agree with what your grandfather told you. It can happen to everybody: glitches in silicon, glitches in code, a fault in an ASIC. But then admit it, correct it and excuse yourself!"/>
			<outline text="If one constantly believes customers are idiots and will continue to suffer from architectural inconsistencies, non-backwards compatabilty of applications etc etc -- maybe in the end there will be some justice and the market will turn against it. Talk to some of the CIO members of the *Research Board*, an institution coming to light during a time of the then &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;. Understand their anxieties of becoming &quot;dependent&quot; again --- this time on somebody else's software -- big time."/>
			<outline text="I have received countless &quot;encouragements&quot; to publically go &quot;against the face of the tirant&quot; but I have refused this. One arrogant behaviour should not breed another one. Remember the Lemmings TV ad some 10 years ago from which *we* at Apple still suffer today?"/>
			<outline text="I have talked to my friends over at Motorola. They never ever in their history showed this kind of behaviour vis a vis their customers."/>

			<outline text="For as long as I have followed the M68000 family, since the late 70s, one of the things I've liked about Motorola was that they were up front with their problems."/>
			<outline text="Their CPU chips carry a MC label on the front of the part number. For example a 68000 is a MC68000. But when the chip has problems with it they label them with XC so a 68000 with problems is labeled XC68000. "/>
			<outline text="You can look at a part and know if there is something wrong with the part. "/>
			<outline text="Motorola also lets you know what the problems are. In some cases I've even had to sign a release before I could purchase parts. They've never hidden problems behind an NDA. "/>
			<outline text="Intel of course doesn't warn you, and you nearly have to beat the bugs out of them, and then they will only hand them over under NDA. When we finally proved that the problem we were having was with the Intel chips, Intel finally took us seriously. They called back and honest to god handled us discovering the problem as follows: &quot;I know why one of those chips works better than the other one. But I can't tell you why, it's confidential. You'll have to sign an NDA and I'll have to send this document describing a workaround through channels.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Motorola faxes me stuff when they find problems, no need to ask for it up front."/>
			<outline text="Which company would you rather buy chips from? "/>

			<outline text="***Ted Leonsis, America On-Line, leonsis@aol.com"/>
			<outline text="I played golf with Chris Galvin, President and COO of Motorola on Friday. Here is basically what he said about Intelgate. "/>
			<outline text="It would never have happened at Motorola. Their motto is practice to the highest ethic and ideal. Their highest currency is their reputation. He believes that internal PR people got involved in the decesion at Intel and that the CEO should have stood up and made the call; the goodwill with employees and customers and the reseller channel would have made up for the onetime earnings hit. "/>
			<outline text="Chris said he totally respected Andy Grove and Intel and that they were a company with great ethics, but in this case, their PR people overcame their personal ethics. He thought the recovery they made was appropriate and that the entire industry had learned a lesson from Intelgate, that promotion to consumers cuts both ways, when you drag consumers into your marketing mix, as oppossed to the trade, you are subject to a much higher standard."/>
