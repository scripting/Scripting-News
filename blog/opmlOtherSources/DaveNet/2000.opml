			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Good evening!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="And welcome to our 2000s.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Blackbird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Sing the old Beatles song. Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's a great song to repeatedly play on a CD. The Beatles put end-of-track pauses in the middle of the song. How many? I can't tell because I've listened to the song about 254 times while I wrote this piece.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;What are we going to do about Y2K?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Many of us imagined, as children, where we would be and what we would be doing when the calendar flipped over, and we all got it wrong. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="For me, it was a toss-up. If the Y2K story had been worth covering I would have stayed on the Internet, learning whatever I could. But there was not much of a story. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A few weeks earlier, a friend who runs the local gas station, an Indian man, asked me &quot;What are we going to do about Y2K?&quot; (I can totally hear his voice saying this!) &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I exclaimed: &quot;There will be problems. And we will fix them!&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's a joke I play on new programmers. A bug is reported. The problem isn't fully understood. I put a serious professorial look on my face. &quot;I know what you should do about that bug,&quot; I say to the unsuspecting programmer. &quot;What?&quot; he asks. &quot;You should fix it!&quot; We all have a good laugh. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Of course since we added the millennial rollover bugs to the software, we can fix the bugs too. We have a heightened appreciation for this now that programmers have to keep servers running smoothly 24-by-7. We'll remember this in the future, the human race is good at this kind of stuff. Fixing things. We do that really well!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Speaking of servers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;EditThisPage.Com&lt;/a&gt;? It's now serving 1500 sites. That number blows people away. So I like to say it often. 1500 sites. On a single inexpensive Windows 2000 box. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Boy are we learning! My friend at Microsoft, Mohsen Al-Ghosein, gave me some good advice a few weeks ago before we released Manila. He said &quot;Just open it up.&quot; I shuddered. &quot;What if people really use it?&quot; He said that when people open up Internet services, they rarely know in advance where their scaling issues will be. Memorize that. It is so true. Better to open the service, let the issues reveal themselves, and then respond quickly.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Here's some of what we learned. Most sites rarely change. And most sites are rarely accessed. The key is to optimize the server so it can handle huge amounts of infrequently updated and accessed content.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Were it not for a design glitch in the Frontier kernel, which we are now fixing, I think we could serve 100,000 sites from a $2000 server on a T1 line. Not static sites, but dynamic sites with Edit This Page buttons on every page.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're also learning how to render static sites from Manila sites, and get this, the static sites will have Edit This Page buttons too (but only if you're authorized to edit the page). We learned this trick from iSyndicate. It works in all the browsers that support JavaScript, which is the overwhelming majority of them. Excellent.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;A bright new beginning?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="As a child I imagined the dawning of a new century as a bright thing.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="After a Spanish dinner, and a half-hour breathwork, I rang in the new century with a group of friends on the roof of a three-story building in downtown San Francisco. We had a view of the ancient San Francisco bus station, with its bright digital clock, and of the fireworks on the Embarcadero. By the time we reached the roof it was already 12:03. The fireworks were exploding. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But it wasn't a bright thing. Why? It was midnight! It's dark at midnight! Duh. Dark and techno (the fireworks), and retro (the bus station) at the same time. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Just like Batman and the villains he fights. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The new century sneaks in, in the dark of night. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Refrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Blackbird fly. Blackbird fly.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Into the light of the dark black night.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;What it means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="That's what the new millennium means to me.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's over. The rest of my time on this planet is a bonus.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I made it. Into the light..&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;For the record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We're a few days late with the DaveNet 1999 in Review site:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet1999review.userland.com/&quot;&gt;http://davenet1999review.userland.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There are some great soundbites, if I do say so myself. ;-&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;It's like fighting City Hall, swimming upstream, or competing with Microsoft. Longterm you end up in jail, being eaten, or testifying in Washington.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;One more thing, you might not agree, but I think the people's business also includes eliminating the death penalty. We kill more blacks than whites, more men than women, and even worse we kill innocent people. It's a hypocritical practice, it's impossible to administer in a fair way, and it's just plain bad karma to kill your own people no matter how horrible they may be.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;The perplexing proliferation of different user interfaces (not just APIs) is what will keep Linux from being a serious option for desktop users, people who write in emailers and use spreadsheets and word processors. For these people, a consistent user interface across multiple applications is a key feature.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Steve Jobs is, as always, a polished presenter. Confident, showing appropriate understatement, and clearly on a course different from many people who develop for the Macintosh.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;It's great to be back again. Lots of interesting mail from DaveNet readers yesterday. Nothing like a political piece to stir the fires. Only a few people told me to shut up. To them finally, it's time for you guys to give it up (they're all men btw). We live in a great world. If you don't like what I say, put up a website and speak your mind. Telling me to shut up is a waste of your power.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;No longer am I wanting to be the next Marc Andreessen or Bill Gates, nor am I trying to recapture the glory of my past life as a software entrepreneur. I want to be part of the machine. I want to make happiness and money. I am not the hero. I am not good or bad. I am an average guy who can help. That's all. And that's not bad.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Writing for the web is too damned hard. It turns you into a bookkeeper. I've got files all over my hard disk and their counterparts on the server. I can't keep track of them! When I'm reading a web page that I wrote, if I spot a mistake, I have to execute 23 complicated error-prone steps to make the change.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Office 2000 is not fun. I think even Microsoft would admit that. Office doesn't really embrace the web because the web isn't just about HTTP, HTML and XML -- in a larger sense the web is about fun!&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Technology serves writers and readers, they shouldn't be limited by technology.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;They keep looking for a company to compete with. But the Internet is not a company.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Are you really happy with what you're doing? The answer is absolutely no. I want it to be a lot better. I want more help, more reliable servers, more talented and responsible people to work with, an easier path, a more loving life, more contact with my own and other people's humanity.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Bottom-line, could the web get by without InfoWorld? Yes. Could InfoWorld exist without support from the web? I think not.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;The thing that's so wonderful about the web is that it's so easy to put up a website. And the thing that's so frustrating about the web is that it can be hard to get people to come look at your stuff.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Ironically, the only way to move forward at full speed is to slow down and support diversity, embrace it, let it be, even celebrate it. The more inclusive you can be, the more powerfully you move.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;What kind of cooking to you like, Italian, French or Chinese? All three require kitchens and tables, waiters and utensils.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;It wasn't fatal because Java was a smoke-blow. But Linux is for real.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;UserLand comes from Windows and Mac, the commercial world, with our hands open. To the leaders of the Linux world, help us by competing with us. Our vision is much larger than any single software product. We want to build a new more powerful web out of all kinds of software.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;To women baseball fans, as with women Linux people, I send my respect. I write as a man sometimes. I don't think enough men do this. There are a lot of women writing about what it means to be a woman. There are even women who write about what it means to be a man! So from time to time I drop gender neutrality, knowing that this is exclusionary, but I have a purpose, to be an example for myself and other men. There's nothing wrong with expressing a male point of view. Thanks for listening.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;I would have chosen Women as the sole runner-up for Person of the Century. This century saw a new balance between the genders and along with it, massive change. It can be hard to appreciate how substantial the change was, since most of us were born after the shift started. There's even a technological reason, birth control. Whether you like it or not, this one invention gave women choice about parenthood. Choice is true power too.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There are lots more soundbites on the website. It's a concentrated form of DaveNet. If you like my writing, you'll like this site. If you don't, have a great day!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Thanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I did something different this year, I asked for volunteers to help with the site. Thanks to Luke Tymowski, Jeff Shelton, Sam Devore, Eric Soroos and Karl Martino for contributing to the review site.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;My five favorites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="It's hard to choose just five pieces from a whole year, but here are my choices:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/21/embraceAndGetOverIt&quot;&gt;Embrace and Get Over It&lt;/a&gt; (where I advise Microsoft to view Linux as they viewed the Macintosh in 1983); &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/05/24/editThisPage&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; (a preview of Manila, six months before it shipped); &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/09/03/theDarkSideOfSyndication&quot;&gt;A Bright Future for Syndication&lt;/a&gt; (an anthem for the web struggling to overcome attempts to control it); &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/11/06/theAncientGeeks&quot;&gt;The Ancient Geeks&lt;/a&gt; (explains how Microsoft is transitioning) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/11/25/wereAllNewbies&quot;&gt;We're All Newbies&lt;/a&gt; (explains why being a newbie is a good thing).&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Davos Newbies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We may have found our niche for Manila. It seems that in one way or another, all the really cool Manila sites are for newbies. A new site that came online yesterday continues the tradition. It's Lance Knobel's &quot;Inside Davos&quot; site, with its very simple tagline: &quot;Advice for Davos Newbies.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://lance.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;http://lance.editthispage.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What is Davos? I am totally not sure! But I'm going. Last year I saw reports and interviews from Davos on the cable news channels. Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Steve Case, just to name a few. It's where heads of state, business and media leaders and Nobel Prize winners meet every year to do what people like that do. What do they do? I don't know, but I'm going to find out and I'll be writing about it on the web, as I always do.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So if you're going to Davos for the first time, or if you have advice for Davos Newbies like me, check out the site. I'm going to get the most out of it, and thanks to Lance for helping make that possible.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Fly MacBird Fly&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/5/00; 6:35:56 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;We were waiting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We've been sitting on the sidelines of the Open Source world, waiting for the right moment to get UserLand and its community into it. We've watched, as Linux, Apache, SendMail, Gnome, KDE and Zope go forward. We saw Apple enter the Open Source world with Darwin. We listened, thought, asked questions, learned, waited. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There's still a chasm, a gap to be jumped, but it's narrowing. There are ways for us to work together. We had to change, for sure, and so did the Open Source world. Now, enough change has happened, and on Monday, UserLand took its first step by releasing MacBird as Open Source.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;What is MacBird?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="MacBird is a draw program with grouping and alignment that's used to design and run graphic user interfaces. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;It's now Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="On 1/3/00 we released the source code of MacBird using the MIT License.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;A new direction for Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="So far, Open Source has been centered on server software. MacBird will help push the cursor toward users. It's all about user interfaces. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="MacBird implements the user interface standard set by the Macintosh in the 1980s. It gives KDE and Gnome a target to shoot for. MacBird is what user interfaces will look like in the post-web era. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="MacBird is the continuation of the journey started by Apple's HyperCard in the 1980s. First we had graphic user interfaces. Then we had the Internet. Now it's time to have both.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Mac first&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="MacBird is Open Source software that comes from the Mac. It isn't the first, after all Python got its start on the Macintosh. But it's different because instead of loosely supporting Macintosh as an afterthought as many Open Source tools do, this software supports the Macintosh first.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;A new kind of coolness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="In the age of the web MacBird has new relevance, because it employs UI techniques and consistency that have been lost as &quot;coolness&quot; became the standard, not ease of use and user performance.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.userland.com/Iowa/screenShots/birdface.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="MacBird wants to be cross-platform, to include the most popular user platforms, Windows, Mac, Be, Java and Linux, in a compatible network of graphic user interfaces that go beyond what web browsers can do. And of course since it's Open Source it can be baked into the browsers, probably quite easily. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="MacBird can also provide a discussion platform to teach C developers how to talk with user interface designers and vice versa. MacBird is close to what designers want. It's not perfect, tweaks and performance enhancements are totally possible. But it's much closer than anything that the Open Source world has created so far, imho.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="My greatest hope for MacBird is that it can foster a conversation between Mac people and the gutsy revolutionaries who are pioneering Open Source software. We want to play, so let's do that. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We call our company UserLand because that's where our focus is and always has been. Servers are so important that we've built our own, but our work remains centered on the revolution that web *users* can create. To do that they want friendly user interfaces that don't surprise them. The no-brainer way to do that is to connect the Mac design community with the geek community around a mature base of free software. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Many thanks to Brad Pettit for helping with this source release. He put in two full days over the New Year holiday to get MacBird building in a modern Mac development environment. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I was very glad to get Brad's help. We worked together on MORE in the 1980s, so I like working with Brad, he's a thoughtful and generous and skilled programmer and designer, and he knows how to work on my code. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So thanks Brad and Happy New Year! &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;10&quot;&gt;A good day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Today is a particularly good day to announce the Open Source release of MacBird, because it's also the opening day of MacWorld in San Francisco. What a perfect day to introduce the Mac world to the Open Source world, in a whole new way. Developer to developer, we can bring the magic of the Mac user experience to the new worlds of Open Source software.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Lots more stuff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Good morning!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Good morning DaveNet readers.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's been a different kind of week. I've hosted my development team in California as we plan our work for the year and seek closure on a project that realizes the next part of our vision of turning the Internet into a beautiful and easy writing environment. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The theme, &quot;Meet your new File menu&quot; that I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/05/24/editThisPage&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in May of last year is now working. I'll probably be using the new software, codenamed Pike, later today. It's an exciting time!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I read in press reports that Bill Gates is thinking along the same lines. I'm going to seek him out in Davos later this month and show him what we've been doing. (I'm bringing my laptop.) Now that Bill is back in development mode, maybe we can do some stuff together?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Davos Newbies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Meanwhile, let me insert another plug for the Davos Newbies site, which now has a more appropriate URL:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davosnewbies.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.davosnewbies.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The site has gotten a makeover thanks to the excellent work of Garret Vreeland, a designer who is infected with the Manila bug. Between Garret and Lance Knobel, the editor of the site, it has blossomed into something I'm very very proud of. DavosNewbies is our showcase Manila site for the first part of this year. If you're going to Davos, as many DaveNet readers are, please check out the site, and if you have comments, questions or suggestions, please let them be known. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're going to arrange some kind of informal meeting in Davos for people who use the site. We'll play it by ear. Davos is a very hospitable environment for creative thinking. And given the environment in the high tech world, there's certain to be some big news coming from Davos. We plan to cover it. I'm also bringing a new digital camera with me.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Finally, this site is so great because of the support we've gotten from the people at the World Economic Forum. They've been an absolute joy to work with. As Lance says, I am *so* psyched!! I truly am. Read on..&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;My Fair Davey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Reviewing the pictures on the DavosNewbies site, one thing became clear. I need to get a haircut and some new suits! Even the people in the press room are wearing white shirts and ties. No problem. As usual at UserLand this project has a codename. First it was My Fair Dave, but to make it more rhythmic, now we're calling it My Fair Davey. Harumph! ;-&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Yesterday I happened to be browsing at the right time, and spotted a NY Times story about Bill Gates's resignation before it had appeared on the other news sites. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I had to read it three times. Could this possibly be real? Had the Times site been hacked? The story looked real. It was syndicated from News.Com. I went to the News.Com site and they were carrying it too. I decided it was a real story. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I quickly ran a DaveNet bulletin, and set aside some time to think about this event.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Strategy or tactic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="On Wednesday morning the Washington Post asked &quot;Which company would get Bill Gates? How would the programmers be split up? And what would prevent employees assigned to the non-Gates firms from quitting and joining Gates's company?&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The Gates stepdown seems to answer these questions pretty neatly. &quot;None of the above,&quot; Bill appears to be saying.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;How it applies to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Gates, more than any other software industry CEO, is identified with his company, both inside and outside of Microsoft. The people of Microsoft have a genuine affection and respect for Gates. I'm not sure the depth of personal committment exists for Ballmer. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Microsoft tends to play by the standard book of American business. Gates will leave room for Ballmer to lead the company. By transferring the CEO role, Gates forever changes Microsoft. This may be the beginning of the biggest transition in the history of the software industry.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Is it real?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Gates is not leaving Microsoft. He remains its largest shareholder and chairman of the board.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A Microsoft board member once told me that Bill could have a board meeting while shaving in the morning. That certainly is still true. Or is it?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="In his remarks, Gates says that this was the logical next step in a transition that began over a year ago when he named Ballmer president of the company. If so, what's the logical next step after this one? One can easily envision a press conference to announce that Gates is retiring to spend more time with his kids, more time reading, or nurturing startups he invests in, as many ex-CEOs do these days.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Unless we could peer into the Mind of Gates, we can't possibly know what his intent is. It could go either way. A Bill Gates with more time to spend with Microsoft product teams could glue the people of Microsoft to the company more effectively. That certainly has to be a frequently asked question in the halls of the Microsoft campus. Bill-spottings are the currency of status inside Microsoft. Will there be more or less of those in the new Ballmer-led Microsoft?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Who is Bill Gates?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Is Bill Gates the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.si.edu/resource/tours/comphist/olsen.html&quot;&gt;Ken Olsen&lt;/a&gt;? This is one of the big questions of this column, first raised in &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet&quot;&gt;Bill Gates vs The Internet&lt;/a&gt;, which ran in October 1994. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Transitions in the software business tend to create Ken Olsens. Please recall that Olsen was the founder of Digital Equipment Corp, now a unit of Compaq. In many ways Olsen was the predecessor of Gates, a strong, opinionated technical leader of a dominant company, undermined by a technological sea-change, and challenged to make a personal transition. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Who won?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Gates, a highly competitive person who is also a student of history, seems unlikely to want to give this up. But the Olsen question is once again raised by his stepdown. Taken at face-value, the announcement seems to be a yes. But were it not for the government action, would Gates be stepping down now? There's no way to know. And therefore, at this time, there's no way to know the answer to this question. Did Bill Gates win? Or did the Internet?&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="Good morning DaveNet readers."/>
				<outline text="I have three new suits, shirts, ties, socks, shoes, overcoat, sweaters, gloves, leather jacket, laptop, digital camera, working on WAP, getting ready for the big trip. It's been eight years since I've been to Europe. I'm excited. I leave Tuesday, flying to London, then Zurich, and then take a bus to Davos and then.. I have no idea where I'm going!"/>
				<outline text="And my little boy, my subconscious self, seems to be OK with it. I've been on the edge of a cold for the last week. I see the cold as a lurking cry of protest from my body. &quot;I like it here!&quot; my body seems to be saying. &quot;Why leave now?&quot; "/>
				<outline text="So I listen, and ask questions, and learn where the fear comes from. It's an old old fear of being cold. I ask the question a parent would ask of child he loves. &quot;Do you think we should bring some extra warm clothes?&quot; The little boy who has no sense of time responds &quot;Yes! That would be great!!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Listen listen listen. That's what love is all about."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Who wants to be a millionaire?">
				<outline text="For some reason I love the new TV show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; starring Regis Philbin and people just like You and Me. I love the show the same way I love the Taco Bell dog. Regis is a corny old dude. But he's likeable, a guy from the Bronx, and he shares bits of wisdom that are worth remembering. "/>
				<outline text="After a streak of losing contestants, including a guy who struck out on the first question, with three unused lifelines, Regis, clearly flustered (maybe it was faked?) says &quot;It's not as easy as it looks.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Spicy noodles">
				<outline text="One of my favorite new dishes is Dahn Dahn Noodles from Jing Jing in Palo Alto. A spicy peanut sauce over Chinese spaghetti. It's delicious! Chinese food at its best."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="More spicy noodles">
				<outline text="Two of my favorite new websites (there are many!) are written by Dan Gillmor and Dan Bricklin. Gillmor is the columnist at the San Jose Mercury-News, and Bricklin is the inventor of Visicalc and the CTO at Trellix. Both Dans are web newbies, two smart people trying something new. "/>
				<outline text="One is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/&quot;&gt;writer&lt;/a&gt; and the other is a software &lt;a href=&quot;http://danbricklin.com/log/&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt;. It must be tantalizing because the web is part writing and part software. Between the two they have everything they need to make it work. It'll take just a little time to figure out how the web changes each of the arts that the Two Dans practice."/>
				<outline text="Even better, Dan and Dan are newbies with a digital camera, and their sites are much better for it. You can see what they see. Visualization is pretty important, at least to me. They were my inspiration for getting a new Nikon CoolPix camera. I'm a total digital camera newbie. And I'm going through the kind of across-the-board growth you get when you do something new. Thanks!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Is it really about money?">
				<outline text="I can make a lot of money on the Internet. For sure. We'll do an IPO, I bet before the year is out. If it works, I'll have many more millions of dollars to add to my bank account which already has a few million. Will it make me richer? Of course not."/>
				<outline text="Having lots of cash will help us hire new people to build out our vision of the Internet as a writer's medium,. We'll have a fancy developer's conference, we'll run prettier press releases and maybe even run ads during the SuperBowl, but none of this will directly make me richer."/>
				<outline text="The only way I get richer thru the Internet is when people who can teach me things start websites. There's so much human knowledge and experience that could be accessible thru the web. Every time a new teacher gets on the net, even if I don't see the site, I am richer. "/>
				<outline text="This is the kind of exponential growth I yearn for. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Amazon">
				<outline text="Amazon is a pioneer of the Internet. I first became aware of Amazon through an ad in the New York Times Book Review. Smart marketing. Reach into the literate mind and put a new word in there. Amazon. Earth's largest bookstore. Memorable, fun and daring. You gotta root for such a broad vision."/>
				<outline text="Amazon broke important new ground in e-commerce applications. Their 1-Click ordering system was truly daring and right on. So much power in a single button! They should be proud of that accomplishment. It was an unobvious invention. Mazel tov!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Geoworks">
				<outline text="Geoworks is the ashen corpse of a company that struggled without an advantage, and somehow managed to stay alive long enough to put a roadblock in the way of one of the most interesting standards to come along since HTML and HTTP."/>
				<outline text="Geoworks has a patent that they believe is the basis for WAP and WML, the two protocols of the emerging wireless web. Watching their press release percolate thru the WAP world revealed that Phone.Com also has patents in this area. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Killer patents">
				<outline text="The Internet is about to get much more complex. Geoworks is not an anomaly. There are hundreds of patents that have been issued in areas that are basic to building out the Internet. "/>
				<outline text="Amazingly, Amazon has filed a patent on their 1-Click technique, and has sued to prevent others from using it. I wonder why Amazon did this. Such brilliant marketing in their early days -- this could become a huge PR fiasco."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Fink">
				<outline text="A couple of years ago I became friends with Dave Fink, former VP of R&amp;D at Disney, a man who has filed many patents. Fink believes that patents are useless as an offensive weapon, when consumers find out what they lose, they'll penalize any vendor that uses them. I agree, but Fink's theory breaks down with Geoworks, a dead company that has nothing to lose. But Amazon? That's another story. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is the Internet?">
				<outline text="What is the Internet? It's a bunch of routers. At every level, economic, political, literary and technological."/>
				<outline text="The Internet is a public space. Anyone who tries to own the Internet, as Amazon and Geoworks have, will be routed around. If Microsoft had truly embraced that idea I don't think the US DOJ would have sued them."/>
				<outline text="Try as hard as you want to own the Internet, we'll figure out a way to work around you."/>
				<outline text="With Amazon, we'll take our case to the court of public opinion. With Geoworks, I don't have a workaround. Maybe we could find something useful for them to do so they will have something to lose? See how patents pervert things!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="My new slogan">
				<outline text="Last week my friend Doc Searls, who could lead an terrific website connecting writers with technologists, said he was searching for a slogan that's as good as SlashDot's -- News for Nerds, Stuff That Matters. "/>
				<outline text="Now, that's a pretty good slogan, but I've got a better one."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Ask not">
				<outline text="&quot;Ask not what the Internet can do for you. Ask what you can do for the Internet.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="It's our guideline for growth. Something I think we can all agree on. And those who can't agree, such as Amazon and Geoworks, should be clearly seen as being on the other side. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Onward!">
				<outline text="When I speak at Davos and Seybold in the next couple of weeks, I'll evangelize the new slogan."/>
				<outline text="When you hear about a new Internet strategy, think of it in these terms. Are they squeezing value out of the Internet, or are they adding value?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Winer">
				<outline text="PS: I wonder what Regis Philbin's &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.imdb.com/Name?Philbin,+Regis&quot;&gt;real name&lt;/a&gt; is?"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="This piece was written on Friday January 28. Because of technical problems I was unable to send it out when it was written. It may be the longest DaveNet ever, but there's an even longer one in the pipe. This piece sets the stage for the one that follows."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Friday night at Davos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="It's Friday night at Davos, and I think I've finally figured out how it works. "/>
				<outline text="One of my fellow Davos newbies said it's like being in a supermarket ten minutes before closing, constantly. You're always rushing to make it to the next thing, but while you're doing that you're supposed to be setting up your agenda for the next two days, and this is always going on, and believe me, it is quite confusing if you've never done it before, especially when you're jetlagged and sleep-deprived at high altitude and cold and worried about slipping on ice and scared by soldiers carrying machine guns. (One fellow Davoser said that Swiss soldiers don't carry handcuffs, they don't need them. Oh!)"/>
				<outline text="This afternoon I came to the conclusion that my first Davos is going to be spent learning how to do Davos, that I would be happy if I got to a few meetings or lunches or dinners that were interesting, I set the expectations low. Cut myself a little bit of slack. But then while I was trying to fall asleep late on Friday night (3PM back at home) I figured it out. I wanted to leave a list of clues for next year's Davos newbies, maybe if you have this all in one place, your Thursday and Friday will be very productive and rewarding, and maybe by summarizing it all in writing, my Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday will be richer too."/>
				<outline text="By the way, I don't want to leave you with the impression that my first couple of days have been anything less than incredible and wonderful! These are the smartest people. I was lucky to go to a high school of the highest IQ kids in New York City. Davos feels like that, but instead of being kids who are smart (lots of potential) these are adults who are off-the-scale smart, who have accomplished something, they wouldn't be in Davos if they hadn't. I had lunch with an astronaut today. I had a frank conversation with a Russian presidential candidate (he was bitter about the United States, we shared that frustration, I tried to explain how crazy the US is, I don't think he understood. We agreed to get together when he comes to the US, I'm going to help him get his story out thru my website). Even the booth people at WorldLink, who I share space with, are smart and sweet."/>
				<outline text="My frustration comes from all the people I haven't had a chance to meet or listen to. And that frustration traces back to too much newness. They do things differently at Davos, differently from any event I've been to before, and that adds to the confusion. So here are the mechanics, how Davos works, my cookie-crumb trail that other Davos Newbies can follow in the future. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Lunch and dinner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="At other conferences, meals are either totally themeless random affairs, or even worse, closed to newbies who may not know anyone to have lunch or dinner with. Not so at Davos."/>
				<outline text="With a couple of exceptions, lunches and dinners at Davos are very structured. The meals happen outside the conference center, at the town hotels. Each meal is hosted by one to three people, who serve as discussion leaders. You must reserve a space at each meal, the reservation system is totally democratic, first-come-first-serve, and is computerized. You go to a kiosk, a touch-screen interface that's quite easy to use, once you get the big picture.  "/>
				<outline text="The emphasis is on fairness. You can only reserve space at a lunch or dinner one day in advance. This allows latecomers to have a great Davos experience too. It can be pretty random. I had no idea who would be at my first meal, a dinner, where the discussion was whether business inevitably had to be like war. Coming into the meeting I was sure that business did not have to be like war, and I left even more sure, but inbetween I had some doubts. This is the best kind of experience, my mind and emotions were engaged, and we had a family-style debate, not unlike jury duty. After we left, I had renewed old acquaintances with Tom and Mary Evslin who I knew from the early days of the Macintosh, and had gotten to know some other people perhaps more than I wanted to, but everyone survived, so that's cool."/>
				<outline text="Reading the conference notes that I got in the mail a month before Davos was probably more confusing than it was worth. I even had Lance's writing on the Davos Newbies site to help guide me. But it didn't sink in! The key to a great Davos experience is to learn how to use the kiosk system as soon as possible. But being a newbie means that it takes at least a couple of days to get it. This afternoon while I was working on my kiosk, a helper from Andersen who had been working with me before, came over to ask if I needed some help. I gave her a thumbs up, no need for help, I Get It Now."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Plenary sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="The plenary sessions are held in a room that in theory can hold all the attendees . If you're late, you have to stand in the back and it gets so packed that leaving can be very difficult. I left the Tony Blair speech early, and missed Michael Dell's appearance, later I learned that I could have watched from one of the smaller rooms, in greater comfort, and I'd recommend that, unless you don't mind overheating in a room that's hard to exit from."/>
				<outline text="Plenary sessions do not require a reservation."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Other sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="There are two types of sessions other than the plenaries, those that require a reservation and those that don't. It's not clear how they decide which require a reservation. The one that I participated in on Thursday, 10 Websites that Will Change the World, did not require a reservation, but the room was full fifteen minutes before the session started. I assume they don't require reservations if the management believes they will not be full. "/>
				<outline text="Many, if not most of the sessions do require a reservation, for the simple reason that the rooms hold as few as 100 people, and 2000+ people attend Davos. So if you want to hear Umberto Eco talk, you have to be quick, and probably lucky. But the cool thing about Davos, that's echoed (no pun) through the structure of the show is that knowing someone does you no good. The rich, powerful and famous queue up with the rest of us coming back into the meeting hall after lunch. This is one of the things I like best about Davos, like all good conferences, they seem to have low tolerance for crybabies. Another aside, on the first day of the show the Wall Street Journal ran a page one story saying the opposite, that the Davos management was for sale. I don't believe it. It's run by academics with high principles. I would depend on their honesty, certainly until I see evidence to the contrary, and unlike other conferences that play favorites, this one really is first-come-first-serve."/>
				<outline text="Also, I think your experience is what you make of it. Each session is pretty open to the participants, and what happens depends largely on who shows up. There's something very rich going on here. We all feel honored to be here, with some exceptions, mostly Silicon Valley people who bring their bad manners with them, that's why I stopped going to software industry conferences. When I mentioned this to Lance Knobel earlier this evening he asked about Esther. Oh Esther! She's the total exception. She's like a little girl, bopping around making faces, and sewing clothes in the back of a meeting room. This is Happy Esther, we could all learn something from her -- why bother being superior? One famous Silicon Valley personality I ran into told me how clueless the people at Davos are. I wanted to ask him why he bothered coming. "/>
				<outline text="I came to a different conclusion.The people at Davos are thirsty to know. There are a lot of things they don't understand, but the spirit of Davos is Ask! Every time I asked for help I got smothered with it. And it's the cheerful sort of Let's Figure This Out kind of  help, not the Oh You Don't Know So You're Not Cool kind of help. I would say Davos, while it's structure is daunting to the newbie, is a total newbie oriented thing. Silicon Valley could learn a thing or two from Davos."/>
				<outline text="After doing the opening day session about the web, people have been asking me to explain how the web works, and the various discussions have lead to explanations of how ISPs work and DNS and email, how they relate, and how they don't relate. One wife-of-a-CEO said that for a few weeks she couldn't get thru to BlueMountainArts.Com, and wanted to know if Microsoft was responsible. I said I knew for a fact that Microsoft was not responsible. I think she believed me, but she didn't understand why."/>
				<outline text="I'm totally rambling, but what the heck. I think the structure of the Internet is actually no more complex than the structure of Davos. But as far as I know there is no newbies guide to the Internet. When I get back to California perhaps we should start a project to do that. I wonder if InternetNewbies.Com is taken?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Other things to get accustomed to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="If you're from North America, Asia or Australia, expect heavy jetlag. I think most people figure that out in advance, it's kind of obvious. As a result a lot of attendees are a little cranky the first couple of days (maybe more, the jury is not in on this one yet). But there are other surprises."/>
				<outline text="Davos is a high altitude place. This means that your dreams will be vivid. "/>
				<outline text="It's also cold, but it's a dry cold. You need gloves and a scarf, and as Lance was very wise to point out, shoes that are suited to walking in snow. I brought beautiful Italian shoes, but I haven't bothered bringing them with me to the meeting center. I did an informal survey on the first day, and believe that fully half the men do it this way. This is one place where people forgive you for wearing funky shoes with a nice business suit. Another wise person pointed out that people usually don't care how other people look, they just care about how *they* look."/>
				<outline text="One thing I have trouble getting used to is machine guns. There are a couple of soldiers at each entrance with machine guns. I guess I'm glad they're there, but every time I pass one, as the gun is pointed at my body, I wonder if the soldier really knows how to use it. The guns are daunting and fear-provoking. That's what their purpose is, but net-net, I don't like them. "/>
				<outline text="Another surprise was the hotel room. European hotel rooms are smaller than those we're accustomed to in North America, yet the price I'm paying would buy a really nice suite in most US cities. And the walls are really thin. You can hear everything your neighbors do, including but not limited to tooth brushing. It's like having room mates you can't see. And forget about watching TV unless you like watching reruns of Kojak dubbed in German. One thing I found interesting is that &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; has been adapted to German, I did watch that, with interest. The German Regis Philbin isn't as corny as the real one, and I don't know if he says smart things like &quot;It's not as easy as it looks&quot; because I don't understand German, although I am trying. "/>
				<outline text="Davos people are very very nice! It's kind of like Wisconsin. I ask my cab drivers if Davos attendees are good tippers, but they won't answer. There seems to be a language barrier there. And speaking of language, words like fahrt and schmuck are all over the place. This makes me giggle. But the cutest thing is that in Switzerland bubbles in water are called &quot;gas&quot; so when a waiter wants to fill you up, he or she asks if you want some gas, and this makes me break out in guffaws of loud American laughter. I'm laughing out loud as I write this and I wonder if my roommates are pissed that their next door American neighbor is laughing so loudly at 1AM (4PM back in California)."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, if you're reading this just before Davos 2001, feel free to send me an email, I'll see if I can help. I'm absolutely sure that I'll want to reminisce about this experience, because not only are the dreams vivid in Davos, the whole thing has a bright color to it, an optimism, a can-do attitude that I thought was just an American thing. Davos is about the world, not about any one country, so from my point of view, they're taking the best of US values and translating them to the world we actually live in in the 21st century, and I dig it."/>
				<outline text="At dinner last night I told the story of my company and likened the last year to jumping out of a plane with no parachute. One of my dinner friends said that's crazy. So I said OK, you have a parachute. Later I thought about it and realized that there is no parachute. Not only do you have to create the parachute while you're in free-fall, you also have to invent the damned thing! "/>
				<outline text="Like it or not, the economy we participate in penalizes companies that live by the old rules, and only rewards the inventive ones that take advantage of the electronic one-ness of the world. I realized that &quot;globalization&quot;, the term that's caught on, is just another word for the Web. The free-fall is disturbing until you realize that everyone is doing the same thing. So the theme of Davos is the theme of DaveNet. Let's have fun, namaste y'all,  dig we must and we're all newbies on this bus."/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Goood evening!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Welcome to the first DaveNet piece from Amsterdam! It's only the second from Europe, and if you were counting you'd care. Anyway, I'm between stops on my trip. Davos finished, sadly, on Tuesday, and I've been in Amsterdam resting, experiencing another European culture, gathering my thoughts, being a tourist, and preparing to talk to the publishing industry at the Seybold conference in Boston on Monday and Tuesday. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;How to make money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="The title of this piece is an answer to the most frequently asked question I heard at Davos, both in the hallways and in the sessions. Yes, the Internet is cool, but how do you make money? This is the question that the Have-Nots ask those that Have, or another way, that the Get-Nots ask those who claim to Get. I am so smug in the belief that I can answer the question that I'll ramble my way there, knowing that it's so pregnant that you'll read all the way to the end to hear what I learned and experienced at Davos just to get an answer to this question that has so many people wondering."/>
				<outline text="But first, several stories from Davos."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Klaus Schwab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Klaus Schwab, the Swiss professor who is the host of Davos, is a medium-height man, fit, always well-dressed, bald, formal in his mannerisms. Dr. Schwab is the head of the World Economic Forum and is the moderator of the most important sessions at Davos. "/>
				<outline text="He has an interesting way of introducing speakers, one which I've never seen before, that I will try the next time I moderate a panel. He addresses the speaker not the audience. For example he would say &quot;Tony Blair, you are the Prime Minister of Great Britain. In your six years in office you have had many successes in bringing your country into the new global economy. You were a Global Leader of Tomorrow, inducted in 1989. We are very proud of our association with you.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="The speaker is beaming by the time he or she takes the microphone. The audience feels as if they are party to a private conversation. It may be an old-fashioned way of doing intros, I have a feeling that Mr. Schwab is old-fashioned in all his mannerisms, even if his ideas were and continue to be revolutionary."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Mit de Cherman agzent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="An aside, Dr. Schwab reminds me how to speak with a German accent, a skill I learned from my grandmother Lucy Kiesler, who was as German as they come. I learned a phrase and tried it out on many of my fellow Davosers. &quot;My name ist Klaus Schvab and I shpeak Englisch mit de Cherman agzend.&quot; When people hear me say that they say &quot;You'll get in trouble!&quot; (It vouldn't be ze firszt dime.)  But it makes me laugh. I can totally visualize Schwab as I say it. I like phrases that reach deep into my memory in a clear way. This one touches my funny bone. Everyone else laughs too because I do it so well. I mean no disrespect to him, and if he reads this (I hope he does) this is the way we do things in America, perhaps with less outward reverence than the Swiss, but with no less respect."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="US President Bill Clinton gave a great speech at Davos on Saturday at noon. The multiple tracks of Davos merged into one. Clinton, who had little sleep in the previous three days looked tired, with big bags under his eyes. He spoke softly, but his message was powerful."/>
				<outline text="Longtime DaveNet readers will know that I am not a big fan of Mr. Clinton. I called for his resignation several times. Have I been turned around on Clinton? Perhaps."/>
				<outline text="Recall that in my last piece, &quot;Two Days at Davos&quot;, I concluded that the message of Davos, globalization, was exactly equivalent to the message of the Web. Mutual respect, inclusion, digging up the old wires and replacing them with bigger ones that go different places."/>
				<outline text="I wasn't sure that Clinton and I were talking about the same thing until Schwab asked him a question after his speech. &quot;Mr. President,&quot; Schwab said, &quot;do you have a message for the business leaders here at Davos?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="After a long pause he said &quot;Find a shared vision.&quot; He expounded, telling the story of trade negotiations and economic imbalances between developed and developing nations. I felt he was stating the problems of the Internet industry using terms that made sense to him. My interpretation: Without a shared vision, something we agree on, growth can never really happen. As soon as a layer of progress is complete, the wars begin, and years of stagnation follow. This is the cycle of the software-slash-Internet industry, and it looks (thanks to patents, more on that later) as if we might be about to loop around once again."/>
				<outline text="So, a shared vision? I thought about this for a few hours. I tried to imagine the leaders of the Internet industry sitting in a room and arriving at a shared vision. Is it possible? I thought about Steve Case and Bill Gates. Case is clearly trying to steer the users into the proprietary AOL world, instead of pushing them to the Web. Gates wants to emphasize the power of desktop computers, with all their RAM and disk space, and of course Microsoft's 20+ year investment in operating system software for desktop software. "/>
				<outline text="Could Gates and Case get on a stage and share a joint vision that's anything more than lip service? Not now. Maybe in a few years, but certainly not in time to make a difference in the battle to keep the Internet open and free. Add the other personalities of the industry, Andy Grove, John Chambers, Scott McNealy, Masayoshi Son, Larry Ellison, John Doerr, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, the list goes on and on, and it seems clear that nothing less than an external redefinition of the purpose of technology could get these men into agreement."/>
				<outline text="Then I realized that such an externally defined vision had already been forced on the technology industry. The standards of the Internet, HTTP, HTML and URLs; and perhaps XML, which is a simple formalization of HTML. To go to the next step the leaders of technology merely have to agree to stop struggling against these standards, and to share the knowledge they have developed around them. The web is ready-made for a shared vision. All that remains is for two or more of the leaders of the Internet industry to get what Clinton, Schwab and Davos are asking them to do."/>
				<outline text="(Shimon Peres, a longtime Cabinet minister and former Prime Minister of Israel would expound on this idea later, in a very eloquent way, at the end of the Davos 2000 annual meeting. &quot;Peace is hard work,&quot; he said.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Media leaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="After the Clinton speech, on Saturday afternoon, I walked to the Hotel Rinaldi for the first meeting of the Club of Media Leaders. Everything in Davos has an official upper-case kind of name. The members of the Club are CEOs, publishers and chief editorialists at media companies from around the world. I was the only web guy at the lunch."/>
				<outline text="We went around the room, each person says what their main challenge was in 1999 and says what their main challenge is for 2000. The most popular answers were The Internet and The Internet."/>
				<outline text="When I spoke, I said my main challenge for 1999 was ease of use and my main challenge for 2000 is to start 1 million websites. I encouraged my fellow media leaders to embrace the web fully and not look back. Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet. Follow this simple rule and you can't go wrong."/>
				<outline text="Of course the &quot;How do I make money?&quot; question dominated, as I expect it will at Seybold, and I have an answer for the media leaders that works, as I expect it will work in non-media operations. But that will come at the *end* of this piece. ;-&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;The demonstrators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Now flip back to the Saturday Media Leaders lunch at the Hotel Rinaldi. We finished going around the room. Klaus Schwab appears briefly to give us a peptalk. Barbara Erskine, the leader of the Media Leaders takes the mike and says that the President of Argentina won't be able to join us because his hotel is surrounded by demonstrators. Wow! &quot;Where?&quot; I ask. She says the Seehof. I'm out of here, now."/>
				<outline text="I walk out the front door of the Rinaldi and immediately to the left is a police barricade with several thousand banner-waving demonstrators throwing snowballs mit firecrackers and charging the barricades. I climb on a snowbank to get a better look. Several polizei grab me, stick hard things in my ribs and push me back. The Clinton press entourage is there in force. A scene from Forrest Gump, all the publishing CEOs, editors in chiefs, CNN film crews, demonstrators crashing barriers, and it starts snowing hard, big wet flakes. On one side the haves, the people allowed inside Davos; on the other side unknowns, the ones who want to be heard. What are they demonstrating for? I never found out."/>
				<outline text="But I did document it, with the best pictures I've ever taken, which isn't saying a lot because I just started using a digital camera a few weeks ago. I think it's like writing. The first step is to have something interesting to say. The second step is to have good supporting technology. In this case a rich story of puzzles, color and contrasts appeared before my lens. All I did was click the shutter."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="The next day, Sunday, was Sports Day at Davos, but it was also Blizzard Day. The demonstrators were gone, thanks to the polizei, and the departure of the Clinton entourage, so there was nothing else to do but attend the media leaders lunch with former Microsoft CEO, now chief software architect, Bill Gates. He gives a brief speech, followed by questions and answers from the cream of the journalism world."/>
				<outline text="Gates echoes many of the ideas you've heard in this column, the power of the personal computer must not be overlooked in the rush to the Internet. He debunks the &quot;myth&quot; of Network Computing as promoted by Sun and Oracle, he says we should check with their customers to find out if their vision had materialized. Gates is confident that it hasn't. I am too, but Bill, don't be so quick to write off Network Computing. It's the engine behind the growth of Yahoo. And while the web browser is a very limited user interface environment, it's not so limited that you can't build a powerful easy to use publishing system around it, as we have. It's good, perhaps, to promote your own company's products, but not at the expense of what's real. Network Computing is great because I can update my site from an Internet cafe in Amsterdam as easily as I can from my office. However, to write an essay like this one, I want great editing tools on my laptop. The Yin and Yang. Of course there's room for Microsoft and other software makers in the world of the Internet. It's not an either-or thing. Hey Bill I'm using your browser right now. "/>
				<outline text="Before the meeting I prepared a couple of questions for Gates and was lucky to have the final word, my question came last, and believe it or not (Forrest Gump again) I had a conversation with Bill in front of all those editorialists. It can be hard to remember all that we said because I was in the middle of it, thinking a step ahead as I engaged with Gates before all those powerful people, but I'm going to try."/>
				<outline text="I referred to the previous day's challenge from Clinton to business leaders. Bill, can we find a shared vision? His eyes lit up. A well-rehearsed story. Our consistent vision for 25 years has been to bring the power of the personal computer to millions of people. &quot;That's the past,&quot; I said, &quot;What about the future?&quot; With fist-pounding enthusiasm, he said that was their vision for the future too. I wasn't satisfied. &quot;What about a *shared* vision Bill?&quot; I kept hoping that he would say The Web, The Web that's the vision we share! In my wildest dreams he would say Ask not what the Internet can do for you. But he didn't."/>
				<outline text="He talked about SOAP, and said that the audience wouldn't understand it, and they shouldn't have to. I said it can and should be explained. He tried, I think half-heartedly and asked if that was OK. I said no. The audience laughed. He offered me the chance to do it, I did a quick mental calculation, it would take at least two minutes to explain, and this was not my forum, it was his, so I declined."/>
				<outline text="Gates closed by recommending that everyone in attendance read my column, which is one of things I find very dear about Bill, it's so hard to be critical when he's so enthusiastic about DaveNet. Anyway, before I move on, Bill I'd like to visit you in Redmond to talk about the shared vision thing. You've done something revolutionary in opening up your network to the standards of the Internet. But like the Doomsday Device in Dr. Strangelove, it does no good if people don't know about it. "/>
				<outline text="I'd also like to visit with Bill Clinton to talk about the same thing. But he doesn't read DaveNet. Yet!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Dezterous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Later in the Annual Meeting, Steve Case, Bill Gates, Sumer Redstone and MIT professor Michael Dertouzous would talk about the future of the Internet. Dertouzous asks us to focus on all the new people who will show up on the Web in the coming years. An A-plus for the professor. This is where the action is, in the million websites that will start in 2000, and in the millions, if not billions of websites that will come in the next decade. That my friends is what globalization is about. A voice for anyone with something to say."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;10&quot;&gt;$750 million for immunization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="In the Plenary Hall on Monday, Bill Gates is on stage with the head of UNICEF, the chairman of Merck, the President of Mozambique, the top people from the World Bank and the WHO, announcing that the Gates Foundation, funded with $21 billion of his money, is making an investment in worldwide child immunization. This is laudable, but weird. I felt sad that we, in the software business, might lose the spark of Bill Gates. It's rare for the sponsor of such a fund to be alive while it's being disseminated. It's also a wonderful thing. Gates, the richest man on earth, is the ultimate trial and error guy. His first ventures into philanthropy will be toe-dips, as this $750 million grant is, for sure, but this is just version 1. When Gates finds a killer app, it's nothing until you get to version 3. Stay tuned."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Patents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="As you know I am very interested in Internet patents, most people aren't yet, so I was the only real dissenting voice at a lunch on Monday to discuss the subject. They had an earnest but friendly dissenter scheduled to speak, representing people from indigenous cultures whose herbal medicines are being patented by opportunistic scientists, but I was not friendly, I was horrified by the absolute, irrational, smug, unsupportable, open greed present in the room."/>
				<outline text="I learned a lot in that session, so my position against Internet patents is even stronger now. First, you should know that there are organizations whose sole purpose is to define and patent new business processes that build on the Internet. Jay Walker, the founder of Priceline.Com, has 60 full-time people working in teams to do nothing more than generate patents. No engineering, no scaling issues, no customer satisfaction requirements (although Walker's company appears to be good at this too), they just a file a claim at various patent offices, and wait for the engineering of the Internet to catch up. A land-grab business. In normal times this might not be such a big deal, but the magic of the Internet, which Walker is exploiting, comes from being free and open, as Joel Klein says, a public space. "/>
				<outline text="How will the patent economy effect open source projects? I was the only member of the open source world in that room. And I was shattered by the greed. After all, isn't there enough money for people who create successful Internet startups like Priceline.Com? Why do we have patents anyway? Is this system, designed for industrial processes, still applicable given the instant gratification reward system for Internet entreprenuers? When your company has a market cap in the billions, is it anything other than unmitigated greed to ask for even more money, for filing a piece of paper with a government? "/>
				<outline text="It might be possible to negotiate with them, but we're going to have to gather some power. I want to be clear on this, I'm outside, I want to charge the barricades, but I don't want to do it alone. If patent madness is allowed to continue without restrictions, the Internet could die, open source or not. "/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;13&quot;&gt;King Abdullah of Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Back to politics and the Middle East."/>
				<outline text="When I went to see King Abdullah of Jordan on Sunday, I was prepared to see an immature shadow of his father, the distinguished if short King Hussein, who died last year."/>
				<outline text="Instead I heard a beautiful speech about peace and friendship. He called the Israelis and Palestinians his brothers. Then he said something that gives me goosebumps to remember. &quot;It's not enough to strive for peace for our children and grandchildren, we must have peace for ourselves.&quot; Ahhh the perfect contribution from a young man with most of his life ahead of him. There is nothing wrong with selfishness in the cause of peace. It's beautiful."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Fast-forward to Tuesday evening, the closing session of Davos 2000. Shimon Peres, the distinguished Israeli cabinet officer in charge of the peace process says &quot;Peace is hard work.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="No doubt! He recalls with affection many late night sessions at Davos with the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. &quot;That man just won't accept a night cap,&quot; he says with a big grandfatherly twinkle in his eye. We all laugh. I can't tell you what a relief it is to me, an American Jew, to see peace in the Middle East. The wisdom of the Peres' years contrasts the youth of Abdullah. This is what a shared vision looks like. This is something the high-tech industry has yet to get. I hope I live to see that day too."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Mr. Son&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Softbank's Masayoshi Son is one of the least-known and most powerful people in the high tech world."/>
				<outline text="An early investor in Yahoo and the largest shareholder in E-Trade, Son also owns one of the richest VC firms in the world, and Comdex and so much else, including the Seybold Conference that I'm going to keynote on Monday."/>
				<outline text="I had never seen or heard Son until Davos. He's got the biggest damned grin I've ever seen. What's behind the smile? He's winning the game he plays, he's the perfect foil for the fear at Davos and Seybold, on stage is the man who Gets It in a 36-point font. "/>
				<outline text="He asks the audience a question. How many of you believe there is an Internet Bubble? 70 percent say yes. Now, how many believe the Internet industry will be worth more than the PC industry? Every hand goes up. Now he points out the contradiction. All the dot-com companies represent $1 trillion in value. The PC companies are worth $6 trillion. So if you believe your own logic, the bubble won't happen at least until stock values go up six-fold. Of course the trick is to pick the winners, but it's sure that Son-San will win. Not only is he long on E-Trade, he's also starting his own all-electronic stock market! No trading floor. He doesn't pause to catch his breath. Right on."/>
				<outline text="(An aside, I attended an excellent panel on electronic stock markets, including Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. He said there's no time to waste in building the all-electronic trading floor. Developers in Europe and Asia are moving quickly. I also had drinks with the chairman of the Warsaw stock exchange. He asked for advice on firewalls and NT versus Unix, which I gladly gave.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Fear of the Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="One of the last sessions at Davos, A Values-Added Century, was a totally inspiring and heart-grabbing set  of stories told by people who are not rich or very famous, who have made a contribution to the world by helping children and refugees, or providing inspiration to women or entrepreneurialism in the developing world. A distinguished heart surgeon and the chairman of the Special Olympics were there too."/>
				<outline text="The stories were so incredible, the thoughts so deep. We learned about the aspirations of refugees, they want choice, freedom, hope. These were recurring themes throughout my Davos experience. I had lunch with media leaders from Russia, received a bear hug from a man who came in third in the Russian presidential election. They want free speech to remain in Russia, but they're not too sure about it."/>
				<outline text="I ate dinner with two women journalists from Poland who lived through the transition to freedom. I heard a stirring talk by Abdurrahman Wahid, the new Prime Minister of Indonesia, one of the largest countries on earth. He says it's not all about money; and he says it in a folksy way. &quot;I am a poor man, but look, I'm president of my country!&quot; Another deep laugh and sigh of relief. Indonesia, a country that needs a leader, has one."/>
				<outline text="The message of Davos is the message of love mixed with fear, which is to say it's a real message. The Internet provokes fear, I think largely because the message of the Internet comes to them from people who are scared. I heard concerns on the stage at the Values-Added session, fear of the Internet, and I asked for the floor and gave one of the best, most impassioned speeches of my life."/>
				<outline text="&quot;I have something important to say,&quot; I said, and all the faces in the room turned to me. &quot;The Internet is not about money. I've been inspired as you have by what I've learned from people on the Internet, from their creativity, humanity, hopes and frailty. Don't give up on the Internet, it is for you.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I said a lot more, but I honestly don't remember what I said. It was probably fairly typical DaveNet stuff, but they hadn't heard it before. I hadn't heard it in this context either. There is an Internet that wants to enable all the voices in the world, to empower people *and* help them create new businesses. I believe that the Web is not only the vision that's shared by technology leaders, it's the vision that we can share with political and economic leaders too. Just think about the Middle East. There are a few bumps, we can all make money on the Internet, and yes I do believe the soppy stuff about the Internet being the next step in the path of evolution of our species."/>
				<outline text="But now, finally, the part you've been waiting for, how you will make money on the Internet, so you can stop wasting time asking the question and get busy getting rich."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;17&quot;&gt;How to Make Money in the Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="Suppose you run a newspaper in Singapore. This defines a community. Open a new server that allows people in your community to create their own Web sites. No editorial policy on these sites, except some obvious ones, don't support illegal activity as long as it doesn't relate to free speech. (I have no idea how the web can work without absolute freedom of expression, but we don't accept  pornography or illegal trade on UserLand servers, and don't recommend that others do.)"/>
				<outline text="Make it easy for your community members to sell goods and services on your servers. Provide a service bureau for accepting major credit cards. Of course, as a faciliator of this commerce you're entitled to a commission on each sale. But that's just half of the value equation, and I'd argue it's the less interesting half."/>
				<outline text="Encourage your community members to gather facts, draw conclusions, state opinions and organize others into action. Read the sites yourself. Require that every editorial person in your workforce read the sites. Have internal meetings where you only talk about what's happening in your community of websites. Have face-to-face meetings where you invite the leading webmasters in your community. Learn from each other. Get down in the trenches, in a sense, and listen, and then write about what you learn. Listen listen listen."/>
				<outline text="As you get to know your community, stars will emerge. Give them space on your home page and run ads on their sites. Be clever in choosing the ads. Link together problems with solutions, some commercial, others just for the good of your community. What's good for your community? You decide. "/>
				<outline text="What just happened? You grew by an order of magnitude. And you grew into the Web, a business that pays a premium market cap, unlike the paper-based publishing system, and the emulation of paper publishing that most publishing websites employ in 2000. The people who run your home page are free to link to stories produced by the print publication, or not. My bet is that within several months, the community web sites will be producing content that's as interesting to your community as the copy produced by your current editorial staff. "/>
				<outline text="Meet with the chairman of your local stock market, if he or she isn't already beating your door down. Issue a tracking stock, or, even better, spin out your new web operation. Collect several hundred million dollars, possibly more, to capitalize your new venture. With that money, buy infrastructure. "/>
				<outline text="Wire up your best new editorialists with broadband connections. Buy them the latest digital cameras. Build a warehouse to stock goods that people can buy from your server. Lease a fleet of delivery trucks to make fulfillment virtually instantanous. Grant stock options to the best editorial people, including ones that come from your old print pub, and also give them stock that they must pass on to people whose sites they support. "/>
				<outline text="Further, think in terms of a global audience. How many people want to know about Singapore? How many people in your city might want to host visitors from far away? Find a sister city in a land far away and find out what makes your communities similar and what makes them different."/>
				<outline text="Spread the new wealth around. And never ask what the Internet can do for you, always do things that just do one thing, grow the Internet, help it reach into the community you define. If you follow this formula, you can't lose, in my humble opinion, unless there is an Internet bubble that bursts before you get the money, but as Son-San says, there are good reasons to believe that there is no such bubble.

				<outline text="Again, in my humble opinion, no one has to lose, but no one gets to keep doing the same job they were doing before the transition to the Web. If you define success in terms of continuing to do the same old thing, you will lose. This is the message that causes so much dissonance at Davos and at Seybold. The people who had a good thing going before the Internet are angry. If they draw a line in the sand, as Sumner Redstone of Viacom did so insistently, sorry it's off to glue factory. But if you're willing to risk it all on your intelligence, experience *and* your enthusiasm for the Internet, you will win. But you have to be willing to change."/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;19&quot;&gt;How this effects publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="In the publishing environment, columnists and reporters will share their space with the people. The pros have to become ordinary people again, and let their writing and ideas compete with the expressions of amateurs. The old publishing standard &quot;Everyone needs an editor,&quot; will soften in the age of universal publishing. &quot;Editing can sometimes improve the effectiveness of writing&quot; is more accurate. People who can self-edit, or have less formal editing processes, will not be held back. Judge the process by the end result. Some people can write without filtering. "/>
				<outline text="We may sacrifice a little quality, both in terms of writing style and factual accuracy. This column is a good example. When I wrote for Wired the copy may have been cleaner, but the ideas were sanitized. It's inevitable when you prepare copy that must pass tests of political correctness. Let's say I was writing for a big publication whose CEO wanted to go back to Davos next year. Out goes the stuff about Speaking English mit de Cherman agzend. Now you might not miss that, but what else would you miss? Would my publisher let me reveal to all our competitors the blueprint for our growth? If I'm untethered, as I am, I am free of those kinds of concerns. If my host doesn't point to my column because of it's limited political correctness, perhaps his or her competitor will? And since I have my own community, I know in advance that this article will get flow. Even so, I don't go out of my way to insult people I like, and I will generally reveal my business model at a moment's notice because I practice the Ask Not What the Internet Can Do For You philosophy."/>
				<outline text="If the market places a high value on the cherished attributes so prized by print-era editorialists, then they will be proven right. But you must have the courage to put your ideals to the test. This isn't a choice you have. Your principles *will* be put to the test, your only choice is whether or not you want to bet against the Internet here. I recommend at least a bet-hedge. and if you really jump in, I think you'll see that the web has its own mechanism for quality. If you want people to return, you have to take the high road, the main person whose reputation you tarnish with weak opinion and incorrect fact is your own."/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;20&quot;&gt;A case study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="If you want to see this idea in action, compare Scripting News and Davos Newbies with the Davos site that Newsweek produced. This is a fair A-B comparison since we were covering the same story. We all had limited resources. Newseek had a group of writers and photographers and production people (today they're webmasters and HTML coders) -- a traditional publishing organization that dates back to the 1940s at least, perhaps earlier. Scripting News and Davos Newbies were written by sole practitioners, one the ultimate insider, Lance Knobel, and the other by an outsider who had been invited to have a look at what goes on at Davos, me. Judge for yourself. To my knowledge, nothing like this has ever been done before."/>
				<outline text="I think you'll find that Lance and I captured a personal view of the conference that goes into some depth, but there's room for improvement. While Newsweek had more resources, the result was more traditional, human interest color pieces, the kind of stuff you could get from watching CNN and reading Reuters. "/>
				<outline text="I envision a Davos, maybe not in 2001, but certainly in 2002 or 2003, where every participant can have their own site, and many do. I imagine that out of 3000 possible sites, there will be 30 excellent ones and 100 very good ones. People outside Davos will be able to experience Davos real-time, from a dozen perspectives (no one person can read 130 different quickly updating sites). And the Davos process will continue year-round, as the community defined by EditThisPage.Com is 24-by-7 and roams the landscape of the web, morphs and grows, and never runs out of ideas for connecting different cultures with each other. As I understand the Davos philosophy, this is totally consistent with it."/>
				<outline text="This is at the heart of what I want to show at Seybold. We can all grow together, but first there has to be respect. At the heart of each print publication is a brand and a team that can lead a community into the web. It's completely human to not want to jump into the unknown, so being scared is OK, it's rational. But inevitably change comes, and you can't take it with you. So take off the parachute, forget what you know, and go ahead and jump. That's where fun comes. That's what we're all doing. None of us get out of this alive. It's later than you think."/>

				<outline text="I had a good net connection in Boston and time to surf, and try as I could, I couldn't find a network of websites that presented the alternative view of Davos I heard so much about in the press reports from the scene. It seems as if the Web had nothing to say on behalf of the protesters. Why? &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And if there are no empassioned websites representing their views, are they anything more than a US presidential candidate vying for airtime with colorful soundbites? On the web they'd have to talk to our intelligence *and* passions, not our desire for colorful cartoons, which they certainly provided. Trashing McDonald's is a visual delight. Now where's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/money/index/ad249.htm&quot;&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="OK, let Davos be a symbol, a crest, a towering &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/static/160/DSCN0275.JPG&quot;&gt;Alp&lt;/a&gt;, a dividing line between the haves and have-nots, but let's build out the substance behind each point of view, and see where the real differences are. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is what I heard from the insiders. Davos is open, but leave your banners home, and stop talking in symbols, start talking in real terms. What do you want? Say it clearly.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Why are the attacks are coming now? As with the protestors in Davos, we haven't heard from the people behind the attacks. There could be a reason for it. But until we know what they think, we're in the dark.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Ultimately a less concentrated, more distributed Internet is how denial of service problems will be routed around. I've been writing about this for years.

				<outline text="And happy Friday. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So many cool things are happening in the world of Web applications. The energy is incredible. We have new competition, and as usual, this is the best motivation for our team and community.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're now hosting over 2700 new sites, all started in the last three months, doing content management in web browsers. It's tempting to see the people using our software as beneath us, that somehow my small company captures all that they're doing. I have to remind myself that this is not so. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Our community. We're not a mail list so we're not in each others' faces. It takes five to a dozen visits to get it. Is this site worth adding to my rotation? These days, every few days, a new one comes along that's worth getting to know.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Two sites recently have energized my own web work by showing me things and points of view that I hadn't considered, or ones that I had forgotten. The best message, the web is quick, throw up some plaster, add some color, let it dry and move on. It's quick. Too much editing sucks the life out of it. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="One site that covers Montana teaches us about the secret love life of CBS editorialist Charles Kuralt, a man who must have loved Montana. His ex-mistress says all women were in love with him. Isn't that weird! &quot;I never thought of Kuralt as a lady killer,&quot; the Montana News man writes. &lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;New technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="It was a record week for new stuff shipping. We released the first WAP/WML support in a web content management system. WAP is the subset of HTTP that's supported by wireless cellphones that double as web browsers, and WML is the subset of XML that those cellphones display. It was easy for us, with a deep foundation of XML object database technology and content management, and a user base that's into experimentation.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We also released a new product called Manila Express that further streamlines the editorial process for busy webwriters. And we rolled out a search engine this afternoon, one that's open in ways no search engine has ever been. With 2700 sites of managed content to index, we're not going to have to play chicken and egg this time around. It's almost guaranteed to gain momentum. Just hours after rolling out, fifty sites are being indexed. And it's an open system, open to any compatible CMS, no crawlers needed; the CMS pushes the changes to the server in real-time and indexing happens once a day. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="You can catch the technological news in the usual place, www.scripting.com. If you go there, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. But that's not why I'm writing this evening.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Tomorrow is the Republican primary in South Carolina. After a stunning victory in New Hampshire two weeks ago, John McCain could, if he wins tomorrow, turn the Republican presidential nomination process into a referendum for choice. Some may think that's naive, that it's impossible for us to actually have a choice in a national election, but I remain an optimist. We really do have choices to make, whether they show up on our ballot or not is different question.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So if you live in South Carolina, please vote for McCain. And then let's make free speech on the Net an issue, as it wasn't an issue in 1996. We're part of a global economy, and what we do in the United States matters, especially to countries where free speech hasn't happened yet.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Iran held national elections today. Hour-long lines of people waiting to vote. A clear choice. As often is the case, countries with a new tradition of democracy hold it more precious than the US does, the country with the longest history of democracy.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We could spoil the Net in our rush to riches. How much is all the money worth if the Net is just another bedtime story medium? Don't be complacent about free speech. None of the candidates, McCain, Bradley, Gore or Bush are champions of free speech. Most have tarnished records in this area. If there's still a contest on Sunday, we could get somewhere. Seeing the Republican debate on Wednesday on CNN gave me some hope.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Last week, an Internet PR blitz from Clinton, some scheduled some spontaneous (the PR response to the denial of service attacks). More lies and grandstanding, and even a not-refuted rumor that Clinton will become an Internet entrepreneur after he leaves office. Oy. It's politics as a TV show. Business as usual. The groggy Clinton who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davosnewbies.com/stories/storyReader$425&quot;&gt;talked straight&lt;/a&gt; to the Davos crowd treats the US electorate as if it doesn't have a mind. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Who loves the Internet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Which of the candidates will speak up for the Internet? Well, they all pay lip service to it. But even McCain and Bradley voted for the Communications Decency Act. Which will have the courage to stand up and say that they want the Internet to be a democratic medium with traditions of free speech guaranteed to other media by the US Constitution? Perhaps a challenged George Bush or Al Gore will? Instead of resorting to gimickry, Bradley could raise the issue, but it may be too late for his campaign. He didn't win in New Hampshire as McCain did. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If there's an effective voter insurgency in either party, there's a chance that the US can overcome the multi-generation legacy of meaningless elections. If Gore and Bush coast into their conventions, there's no chance, in my humble opinion, of there being choice. So vote for McCain, and after he wins, let's ask him about free speech on the Internet. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="BTW, I asked this question of the Russian leaders at Davos. They told jokes and laughed about free speech. I never seem to get the chance to ask US political leaders that question.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="From Indonesia to Singapore, India, even the Middle East, economies are transforming around the Web. If US leadership in freedom is lacking, perhaps the ball will be picked up by other countries? You can't have an Internet economy without lots of things, peace, clean air, a good education system, and yes, I think free speech and funcitonal, participatory democracy will be a competitive advantage.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="My inner-skeptic speaks up. Hey Dave, don't y'all have free speech? Yes, perhaps. But are we any good at it? In the US we've gotten soft, so mushy with communication, we're no good at listening, we've given up, so maybe the opportunity to grow thru the Web will be elsewhere in the world? Or in the world at large? Maybe no single country will own the Web? Hey we're the ones with the screwed up Patent Office.&lt;p&gt;"/>

He groaned, remembering that Hollywood's last contribution to globalization, TV sitcoms, game shows and Oscar winners, was not appreciated in the rest of the world (maybe even not everywhere in the US!). &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I said this time globalization of US-generated concepts could be different, we could export free speech, and be loved (and despised) by the right people. We jumped up and down. Let's do that, make free self-expression the cornerstone of the new economy!&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Amazon strikes again!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="On Friday I got an email with a pointer to a TechWeb &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20000225S0013&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on a new Amazon.Com patent, this one even more offensive than the last. Amazon claimed to own the idea of affiliate programs, and the US Patent and Trademark Office had granted them a patent, number 6,029,141. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Unlike some who have taken patents as a defensive measure, Amazon clearly has a different purpose, as illustrated in their suit against Barnes and Noble over the 1-Click patent. Now their business model is clear. They will be able to raise prices by the cost of their license fees. This will get them out of the red, and force their competitors to withdraw. When that is done, if it's allowed to happen, there will be a single e-commerce vendor, Amazon. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now, it would be an interesting conundrum if there was an aha in there. Something brilliant that no one else had thought of. On a brilliance scale of 1 to 10, the Amazon affiliate idea is a zero. It's a repurposing of multi-tier marketing, and has been in wide use for decades. All they did was apply that idea to the Web. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Amazon is betting that Internet users don't care. But the eToys vs eToy issue proves otherwise. When an Internet company moves too aggressively they'll eventually have to listen to their customers. The issue for customers is fairly simple. If Amazon has no competition, prices are sure to go up, and further, the competitive environment of the Web will die.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Please think about this. The users of the Internet have been beneficiaries of an unfettered competitive environment. As an industry we are famous for moving quickly, partially because the technology is so exciting, and also because the rewards are so huge. We're in a very sweet spot, we *can* move quickly because we invested and it worked. The Web is going places, as long as companies like Amazon are not allowed to own the growth.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="In a Q&amp;A session &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/375396.asp&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford, an Amazon shareholder said &quot;I own 100 shares of Amazon.Com, and I wonder if you can tell me what it is exactly that I own.&quot;  Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, said that she owned &quot;a piece of the future.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is the bug. Let's fix it.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Buy from the competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="The Amazon situation raises an important question. Are users of the Internet powerless? Well, no. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If we guessed correctly that Amazon is moving aggressively with patents to force a shakeout among their competitors, then  customers can turn the jets in the other direction. It's quite simple. Buy from their competition, now, while they still exist. That would be an example of the Internet routing around an outage, something it's famous for.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="In other words, until Amazon stops using its patents as a competitive weapon, Internet users would be advised to adopt this slogan: &quot;No more pesos for Senor Bezos.&quot; This emphasizes that the Internet is international. Maybe this is an US-versus-everyone else issue? I'd leave the US over this one.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Another thing to do, if you run a Web site and point to Amazon, stop doing that. And if you're part of their affiliate program, resign. And if you're a book author that sells through Amazon, develop a relationship with another online bookseller. That should make a few waves at Amazon and elsewhere. Put fear into the minds of any technology exec that would use a patent as a weapon to limit competition.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Exploration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We've had an excellent exploration of the Web patent issue on Scripting News over the weekend. If you're interested in understanding where I'm coming from, as a software developer and innovator, read this piece I wrote on Saturday:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$374&quot;&gt;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$374&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's a bit rambly, but makes a key point. I don't want lawyers to run my development team, and I don't want to compete against teams of lawyers. I love the competitive environment we have, it's how I learn and grow, and how my users and customers get new features, and why we strive to offer faster servers and more reliable systems, and respond to users' feature requests. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We know that if we don't keep moving, because our customers have choices, we will lose. That's how the technology market has always worked, and how it should continue to work. It's how users are guaranteed that if I fail to innovate they will have choice. The patent system, as it's currently implemented by the USPTO is threatening that system.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Patents are a divisive issue among technology insiders, but it shouldn't be divisive for users. The users have a clear interest in diversity. It's time to think, because if we keep going on the same course, things are going to change, imho, for the worse.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Humor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Then I came up with an idea for a business process patent. Here's how it goes. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;A method for eliminating competition consists of filing a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office combined with campaign contributions to major political parties, so as to cause competitors to be unable to offer certain high-value features or raise investment capital.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What do you think?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Something positive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Finally, out of all this michegas comes a positive idea. Let's create an intellectual property database like IBM's that documents unpatented prior art, so that lawyers defending against patent suits will be as well-informed as those on the other side.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I wanted to get the ancient outliners on the Web last year so that we could safely move back into outlining without fear of patent lawsuits. As long as we stick to unpatented functionality in ThinkTank, Ready and MORE, we are safe. This body of prior art dates back to the mid-80s, before the USPTO was granting software patents.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Same with MacBird, which we released in Open Source at the beginning of the year. It also predates the USPTO policy change. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Every technologist can and should do the same. If you created software or business processes prior to the early-mid 90s, document your work and put it on the Web. Let's get a search engine to index your site.This is something the Web can do better than any previous medium. We have search engines and hierarchy managing software, Homestead, Epinions, Yahoo, Atomz and Google, all the tools are out there, we just have to invest.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Let's do something good for the Net. Let's love the Net instead of sucking the life out of it. In other words, ask not what the Internet can do for you, as Amazon does, ask what you can do for the Internet.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Last night's post from Tim O'Reilly got SlashDot moving; and this morning Dale Dougherty, also of O'Reilly, posted a short &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/patents/2000/02/29/contro.html &quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of &quot;controversial&quot; patents that relate to the Internet industry.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="From Jeffrey Wilkinson. &quot;You might suggest that people write letters.  Boycotts are more effective when you write and tell them that you're doing it and exactly why. Just cutting off your links and buying without telling them explicitly is less effective.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I totally agree!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Faisal Jawdat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">

				<outline text="I like how he says he'll come back when Amazon is finished with patents. A message saying &quot;you've lost me forever&quot; might be emotionally satisfying, but probably gets your message into the bit bucket, and might get your name removed from their database. And in reality, many of us *will* come back to Amazon when the pressure is off. Why?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Because Amazon has a deserved reputation for being responsive to its customers. I get promotional emails often, and Amazon does it better than anyone else. Their database knows what I like. They sign the emails with the name of a person, an editor or product manager, sometimes even Jeff Bezos himself! I like that because it's personal (even though I know it's a script that wrote the email). Presumably there's a real person reading the responses. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Like a letter to your Congressman, this is the most precise place to register your point of view. It should be the place that Amazon wants to hear from you. So think, and then say what you think, next time you get an email from Amazon.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Even though I've been active in XML, this is the first time I've spoken at an XML conference. Thanks to Tim Bray for inviting me to talk. In May I am the chair of the WWW9 developer day track on distributed computing. So it looks like I am becoming part of this community. Hello!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="RSS">
				<outline text="Two XML-based formats I've been involved with both happened outside of the standards bodies. The one I want to talk about today is XML-RPC, so here's a brief on what RSS is and why we're interested in it, and then I'll move on to XML-RPC."/>
				<outline text="In December 1997 I got interested in XML, and I looked around to see what we had that could be XMLized so I could get some practical experience with XML. I run a weblog named Scripting News. I thought it would be interesting to publish a not-marked-up version of SN in XML and see what happened. Not much. But then in 1999, Netscape came up with RSS format, and we quickly adopted it, as many pubs were doing deals with Netscape for syndication based on RSS. "/>
				<outline text="We started My.UserLand, which is an aggregation engine based on RSS and our own format. We also participated in the design of RSS 0.91, which includes almost all of the features of our format. One important feature is still missing from RSS, the ability to include more than one link in a snippet. If you want to get educated on this subject, send me an email and I'll post a page with links to RSS-related stuff."/>
				<outline text="Now on to XML-RPC."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It started for me in the mid-80s">
				<outline text="In the mid-80s I was a Macintosh developer, had a hit product, MORE, which was a combination &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; and presentation program. Nowadays outliners are standard in presentation tools, but then it was considered controversial to do anything in an outliner, so many people wanted us to unbundle the outliner and connect them to the presentation program thru a plug-in architecture."/>
				<outline text="Of course in the mid-80s on the Mac there was no such architecture, so after selling the company to Symantec, I left to explore this idea. What if software were componentized so that a writing tool could connect to a database or rendering engine? What would you need?"/>
				<outline text="We got all the way to a solution, but by the time we had the idea working, the Mac was in serious decline as a developer platform, and the Internet was booming. I switched careers, became a writer, and then got interested in the Web as a writing environment, and guess what, the plug-in thing came up again! "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Web as groupware">
				<outline text="I wanted to understand what kind of a medium the Web is. Like many, my first guess was that people could use a productivity tool to write for the Web. I did one, called Clay Basket, in many ways like NetObjects Fusion, but predating it by about a year. It was a dead-end. It turns out the Web as a writing environment is groupware, not a productivity application. I found this out when I used Clay to manage a site with 1000 authors. Shortly after that experiment, we switched gears and started working on a group writing environment based on the standards of the Internet, HTTP and later, XML."/>
				<outline text="It was a puzzle. We did a strong server side, built in our object database, but I kept searching for the easiest way for writers to write for the Web. One of the things I tried really worked -- writing in a web browser like Netscape or MSIE. Why is that so satisfying? There are a lot of reasons, most important is the integration of browsing with editing. When you see something that needs to be changed, you're already in the browser. So any content system that doesn't have hooks into the browser is seriously more difficult to use because you have to master two navigation systems, and that's where the complexity is in writing for the web."/>
				<outline text="Another way of looking at it. The browser is a great editing tool because it understand HTTP at its core. It knows how to read stuff on the Web, and it can work with the local file system, but even in that mode it treats the file system as if it were an HTTP server. "/>
				<outline text="But the browser also sucks as an editor because it has a shitty text editor, which pales in comparison to the best editing tools that the PC software generation created, things like Word, WordPerfect, BBEdit, Homesite, etc. And the browser has no design tool like Dreamweaver or image editors such as PhotoShop. And it's only going to get worse because we need vector graphic design tools to do SVG, which looks like a great standard and something that's much-needed on the Web."/>
				<outline text="In other words, if you want the best Web editing environment, you have to figure out how to connect the best writing, design and graphics tools to the content system, as if they were Web browsers. That's going to yield the best results, and is, imho how the TBL vision of the Two-Way-Web will be realized. We're on the cusp of delivering this, having already shipped the browser-based editable Web (Manila); the software we release this month will be a desktop writing tool that's integrated with the Web as intimately as the browser is."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="That's our motivation">
				<outline text="I heard people say yesterday that they've never heard a reason why XML-RPC technology is needed, but hopefully at this point no one can say that. I believe the Two-Way-Web is the most compelling vision since the Web itself. Can you do it without some formal protocol for connecting the apps together? Not if you want users to have choice. And of course if users don't have choice then it's not the Web, because that's one of the key things about the Web (maybe the only key thing) and it's also why Amazon's patents are so insidious and unweblike, but that's another story altogether."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What works?">
				<outline text="I was one of four people who designed XML-RPC. The others were Don Box, Bob Atkinson and Mohsen Al-Ghosein. Don is an independent developer, like myself, and Bob and Mohsen work at a huge company in Redmond Washington. The initial spec took a day to design, and two weeks to finalize. This work was done two years ago, in March 1998. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.xmlrpc.com/ "/>
				<outline text="After the initial spec, Microsoft starting tearing it apart and W3Cizing it, which seemed an endless process, because W3C kept changing its mind about how XML works. Luckily we split off from Microsoft, and published a spec for XML-RPC, and asked for support publicly from the open source community and were not disappointed. We did the first implementation in our content system, Frontier. Fredrik Lundh did the Python version, then Ken MacLeod did one for Perl, and then we got Java, PHP,Tcl, JavaScript, etc. Now we have virtually every programming environment supported, every OS that's in current wide use."/>
				<outline text="Last summer it seemed that Microsoft was finally ready to go with SOAP, which is what their version of XML-RPC became. I felt it was very important to get a big well-known technology company publicly on board so I endorsed it. To me it makes no difference what the underlying transport is, as long as it's reasonably efficient, I'm only interested in applications. As I said earlier, to be weblike, users must have choice, and to have choice we must have a standard."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday the W3C had a BOF meeting. They're interested in working in this area. And amazingly, Microsoft seems ready to let them take apart SOAP, which appears to me to be a formula for another two-year-wait for the two-way-web. To me there's a sense of urgency, the Web needs integrated tools as the Mac needed them in the 1980s. A long W3C process, I think, means a fractured market. I had a long talk with one of the W3C guys yesterday and here's what I suggested, but I didn't get a positive response."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="W3C should adopt XML-RPC">
				<outline text="It's low-tech, clean, easy to understand, a four-screen spec, widely deployed, transparent, efficient, and most important, it's frozen, not subject to debate. Take it as a whole, without changes. "/>

Make it work over any wire protocol you can think of. Provide hooks for firewall people. However, I believe the adoption rate of such a spec, once finished, will be slow. In the meantime XML-RPC can define a market, as HTTP and HTML did. In other words, adopt the old maxim, let the market decide."/>

				<outline text="He stops short of swearing off using patents against his competitors, which is my sole issue relating to patents. Unused patents are harmless. Maybe I wasn't clear in my earlier writing. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The concern is about patents used to stop things from happening. The logical outgrowth of that is software developed solely by lawyers. If you want that kind of software and web services, stay quiet.

My fellow panelists are Evan Williams of Pyra, Peter Miller of 1010data.com, Dan Bricklin of Trellix, Steve Guttman of HalfBrain, Ken Rhie of ThinkFree, and Eric Krugler of Bitlocker.

If you're going to Esther's and would like to discuss this, please let me know; if there's enough interest, we'll reserve a room. I certainly don't expect everyone to agree with my point of view, as usual.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Software is different from writing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="As a writer, there are no blocks to what I can express, as long as it's an original expression, I can even quote other writers, as long as I do it fairly and with attribution. When I do that, no lawyer is allowed to interfere. We call this freedom of speech, and while not absolute, it is guaranteed by the US Constitution. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Talking with Werbach, who is a writer, earlier today, I asked how he'd feel if he couldn't express an idea that I had already expressed? He agreed it would be hard to be creative that way. Same with software, say I.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I wish we could go back in time, when politicians and lawyers used our software instead of trying to control it. I guess it's our fault, it must be, because if they really loved what we were doing, they wouldn't interfere with it.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Good morning!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="The battle over Amazon's use of patents escalated overnight.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But first an observation. Had Bezos not posted his open letter yesterday, the issue probably would have faded away. It got very little coverage, just an article in Wired News, and unbeknownst to me, an op-ed piece in the Irish Times by Karlin Lillington. &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/finance/2000/0303/seven9.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/finance/2000/0303/seven9.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Maybe it's those continuously absent profits that have warped the company's attitudes. Whatever the cause, book-to-kitchen-sinkseller Amazon seems to be manifesting some serious corporate personality defects. In short, Amazon is acquiring the attitude and intentions of an Internet bully.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;A response from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Lillington received a response to her Irish Times piece from Amazon spokesperson Bill Curry. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="He said: &quot;Bullying? Greedy? Warped? Tell us what you really think! Try visiting www.amazon.com/patents. And before you run any more misguided stuff, maybe you should talk to us. And you'll also want to  visit www.oreilly.com for a better understanding of the patents.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="She forwarded the email to me with this comment: &quot;I have never in 5 years of working as a tech journalist received such a rude reply from anyone I've written about -- much less the company spokesman for a high-profile firm.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It is unusual! Even so, I followed Curry's links.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I re-read what Bezos says. Taken at face value, he gave the issue some thought, and found that he truly cares about the Internet, and understands that freedom of expression, not just in writing, but in technology, is essential to what the Internet is. He's having second thoughts about using patents as a competitive weapon. I think this is great! &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$15495&quot;&gt;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$15495&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But as much as I like the spirit of what he says, I still see that he is using patents to limit competition. How you say it is not as important as what you say. The patents are still there and are still being used to limit competition.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I also went to O'Reilly, at Curry's suggestion, and re-read his essays, but he doesn't think Amazon is clear of the problem.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Finally Curry says we should talk to him to avoid being misguided. But honestly, who would want to? &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Go Internet!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Most companies use extra care when communicating with their adversaries.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I used to love Amazon. When I saw their ad in the New York Times Book Review I cheered. Earth's Largest Bookstore. Go Internet!! I felt like I was on their team and vice versa.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now I am on the opposing team.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;JLG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Jean-Louis Gassee, my virtual uncle, used to say when he was product chief at Apple: &quot;As the monkey climbs the tree, more people can see his bottom.&quot; This is good advice for Amazon if you want to try to understand what's happening. You became important. People have opinions about what you do. This is natural, to be expected, and good for you. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;The sub-text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="And to those who believe I have something personal against Amazon, I've bent over backwards to make it clear that it's not personal. Let me state it very clearly. Amazon is a foil, we're using them, to expose the issue, and in doing so, are fighting with companies who have not yet chosen to take their claims to court. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Due to an accident of history, Amazon is first, but there are plenty of companies waiting in the wings, watching what's happening, deciding what they will do with *their* patents. That's the sub-text.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;We're on the Cluetrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="A harrowing question raised by Sun people I met with on Wednesday. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Has Microsoft filed a patent application on XML-RPC technology? Since Microsoft cites me as a supporter of their work (I am), and since patents take a few years to pass through the USPTO, I must find a way to ask this question without provoking the usual &quot;You Don't Love Us&quot; response from Microsoft, which I find intimidating because it puts me on the defensive. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Then I realized something about Microsoft. To most people, including people at Microsoft, you're either anti-Microsoft or pro-Microsoft. Then thinking about it some more, this isn't just true of Microsoft. It's also true of Apple. And it's true of Linux and Open Source. And Amazon! And it's not just about computers either. It's pretty much everywhere. And it's total bullshit.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The Cluetrain Manifesto, which both Bezos and O'Reilly cite in their essays, says a lot about this. If a market is a conversation, is it acceptable if it's an immature conversation? Neither Amazon or Microsoft need my love or support to survive. I am not their mother. I may ask questions, and they deserve direct answers. This is how adults relate to other adults. First answer the question, and then we'll see if I love you, or if I'm scared of you.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Speaking of the Cluetrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Christopher Locke, one of the Cluetrain authors, mentions the Bezos-O'Reilly public posts as evidence of their clued-in-ness. &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topica.com/lists/egr/read/message.html?mid=2000766728&amp;sort=d&amp;start=30&quot;&gt;http://www.topica.com/lists/egr/read/message.html?mid=2000766728&amp;sort=d&amp;start=30&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But Chris, how would you feel if the art you practiced were subject to the kinds of nonsense rules the USPTO is trying to foist on software developers? &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Could you have published Cluetrain if Tom Peters had the patent on books that help businesses use technology?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Something to think about?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;An irrelevant conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="My theory is that Amazon has been using us to have a conversation with Barnes and Noble. I believe Bezos, if he takes a step back, will realize that it's not actually worth the trouble, and that he can score big by relenting, because in doing so he can make it less likely that anyone else will use a patent as a weapon.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="He can help us win the war with Geoworks, for example, and help fight back against Priceline. In other words, there's an AHA waiting for Bezos and his board members. An opportunity to get it, to help the Internet, instead of exploiting the Internet. If you help the Internet, I believe you will get the support of the Internet, and that's powerful stuff. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="(What is The Internet? It's a virtual groupware thing, but very real, like The Stock Market.)&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="O'Reilly made a very strong point in his initial essay. We have all been the beneficiaries of a mountain of free ideas. Let's have more of those, not less. Amazon's improvements to the Web, while useful and innovative, are tiny little bumps on the mountain, yet they stand in the way of its growth. That is what I want Bezos to respond to.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&quot;One thing is certain: the modern Internet entrepreneur is not a species in need of extra government incentives. If one-click ordering had not been patentable, surely Jeff Bezos would have invented it anyway in May 1997, put it to work in September 1997, seen it copied in subsequent years by Barnes and Noble and thousands of other Internet merchants, learning from his success, to the overall benefit of consumers. Surely he would have become a very rich man; and his future success would depend on his ability to continue outperforming his competitors, and to continue innovating.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Another talking outline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="On Tuesday at Esther's in Phoenix, I will lead a panel of experts to explore a relatively new area called Web Applications. This is one of those pieces where I outline a speech to memorize it so it will go over well without slideshows and software demos. There are so many ways for those things to go wrong. Just speaking is good enough for me for now.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;What is a Web Application?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Simply, there are two kinds of Web sites, those that behave like magazines, places where you read stuff; and sites that behave like software, places where you go to do stuff.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Examples of magazines include the NY Times and Newsweek sites, Weblogs like Robot Wisdom, Evhead and Scripting News, the Encyclopedia Britannica, Fast Company and the Van Gogh Museum. These are published sites, created by writers, designers and graphics people.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Examples of applications include Yahoo's calendar, Hotmail's email tools, Register.com's registration page. These are software tools and utilities that run on a server and interface through a Web browser like MSIE and Netscape. The people who create Web applications are programmers and user interface designers, experts in creating software. There is some overlap between magazine and application designers. There are words and graphics in software, but the design job is different when the user's words, pictures and data are in the design too. It's more complicated.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, today we're talking about the applications, not the magazines.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Interestingly, they're much like the desktop apps we used to (and many still do) use. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The Web-based calendar is like desktop calendars. Hotmail is like Outlook Express or Eudora, but running in a Web browser. Register.com is like Norton Utilities, but the computer you're maintaining is one we all share! A virtual computer, if you will. An exciting idea of course. And it works, DoS attacks and all. An amazing human accomplishment. I digress.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Web Apps are better than their desktop counterparts because they're incredibly portable. I still travel with my laptop, but there's less panic as I leave, did I forget to bring a critical file with me? Not a problem if my calendar and writing environment are on the Web.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There's been a lot of new activity in Web applications for a simple reason. It takes time to figure a new environment out. The Web browser is one of the toughest user interface environments we've ever had to develop for. It's even weaker than the Apple II, not quite HyperCard or VB, but more powerful than CP/M or Unix. But it's a big step-back from the UI power of desktop apps and graphic user interfaces.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Think about menus. How many commands can you put in links on a Web page? How many commands can you comfortably put in a menu bar? Far more, without exhausting the user with a multitude of choices. An example, I like MSNBC because they have menus that work like the menus in desktop apps. I wish every Website had these features. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What about Microsoft? The rate of progress is at least somewhat gaited by the sole surviving browser vendor. This raises a fundamental question for developers of Web applications. How far out on the MS limb do you go? What if they break your apps? This will be an interesting question for some of the members of our panel on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Will the space of Web Applications evolve as the desktop space did? Will there be a push towards standardized user interfaces or will Website designers forever be creative? Many of the most visually pleasing Web App sites are ridiculously difficult to use. Gotchas, glitches and dead-ends. While you're stuck, little creatures dance and sing. They're very beautiful, if I had time to notice.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Yahoo, after all, is still the most popular Web app out there. Not much eye candy there.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Remember OLE, OpenDoc, Java Beans, etc. Will there be counterparts in Web Apps? Ways for apps to be componentized and linked and combined? Or will they be monolithic integrated apps like Symphony and Framework? This is why I'm interested in XML-RPC and SOAP. I believe in the power of choice!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What about interfaces between desktop apps and Web Apps? I think this is essential. What do others think?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;The Web on Web Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">

				<outline text="Of all the products, 1010Data is the only one that charges the user a fee, which makes it possible for them to do things the others can't, like support an XML-RPC interface for the app, which of course, I encouraged him to do. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A week earlier Dale Dougherty of O'Reilly, who's becoming a Manila user, asked for a database that ran in Manila. Dale meet Peter, who can give you the database and through the magic of interapplication communication, it will appear as if it's in Manila. Hah! The hype of years gone by still works. ;-&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Eric Krugler of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitlocker.com/&quot;&gt;Bitlocker.Com&lt;/a&gt; showed a web-based database too, but it had far more polish and visual appeal than 1010Data. Clearly patterned after Filemaker, the interface was a one-to-one correspondence, the terminology carried over, and even though it ran in a Web browser and didn't hide the fact, you got a suspension of disbelief. This is what Filemaker would look like in the Web age. Good job. However, it didn't hold up under closer scrutiny. With usability expert Jakob Nielsen in the audience nodding his head, we discovered that the program's use of wedges was expedient and not consistently implemented. Krugler nodded his head too. &quot;We still have work to do,&quot; he said. Excellent.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Then we switched from databases to writing tools, Pyra's Blogger and Trellix Web Express.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; was demo'd by Evan Williams. This was the only product that I had used before. I couldn't feign confusion because I understood how it works, and at one point I had to stop myself from answering an audience question on Evan's behalf. I apologize for this. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Blogger is a web site that once-configured (easy) can add news items and comments to a Weblog-style site. The items, bits of text containing HTML links, appear in reverse-chronogolic order on your website. It saves through FTP. It's an easy editorial system for a fast-changing website. The audience had clearly never seen a tool like Blogger and they were delighted. Literally you could hear oohs and ahhhs. Blogger is sexy, and Evan is adorable, Blogger has the attidude of a 20-something Web designer based in San Francisco. It's style and it's cool and you just gotta like. Everyone did, you could tell.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Later in the session Evan let some news slip. They had programmed a prototype version of Blogger that could save to a Manila site through XML-RPC. &quot;Excuse me while I fall off my chair,&quot; I said. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I think I'm becoming Jean-Louis Gassee. ;-&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Trellix Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Next up was Dan Bricklin and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trellix.com/&quot;&gt;Trellix&lt;/a&gt; Web Express which is a wonderful app that you can use to create and maintain a multi-page website from a set of pre-designed attractive templates. They adopted our Edit This Page design (although their buttons are just called Edit, a minor distinction). It's very beautifully designed, lots of templates for the casual web writer to choose from. A solution to a terminology problem we had been grappling with. A gorgeous DHTML interface that makes our Netscape 2-style UI in Manila look a little old. He showed his writing tool connecting to his website. Impressive, although it uses FTP and saves static HTML files.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Their software is not as deep as ours (btw, I said none of the following at the session, as the moderator my first obligation was to the audience, as I made clear before the session to my fellow panelists). We're deep and powerful, they're beautiful and easy. I know Dan would prefer if we didn't see them as competition, but it's relatively easy to hide features so they don't get in the way of novice users, and know that they will appreciate the more advanced features if they become an expert user. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;HalfBrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Next we switched from Dan Bricklin demoing a text tool, to Steve Guttman of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halfbrain.com/&quot;&gt;Halfbrain.Com&lt;/a&gt; demoing a web-based spreadsheet. It was stunning. Man that looks like a spreadsheet! And it's connected to the Internet, you can include realtime stock quotes in formulas, and they recalc. Oh this is so nice. It looks and behaves like Excel but it's DHTML. It so closely mimics Excel that you can hardly tell you're in a Web browser, but the title at the top of the window confirms that you are. We also got a sneak peak at their presentation tool, of course it looks and behaves like PowerPoint, but in DHTML. This is the stuff Microsoft wanted when MSIE 4.0 shipped, a couple of years ago.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I asked Steve why the site is called HalfBrain, he said that the domain was available. I was a little disappointed, I was hoping for a good story.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;ThinkFree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="As it turns out we saved the best for last. Ken Rhies, a youngish-looking Korean who's over 40, has a stunning ripoff of Microsoft Office running in Java at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkfree.com/&quot;&gt;ThinkFree.Com&lt;/a&gt;, and it totally doesn't look like a Web app. The people in the audience were stunned, as I was. &quot;What part of the world don't you want to dominate?&quot; I asked. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Ken is one of the best demoers I've ever seen. Despite all the oohs and ahhs he kept piling on features. Look, it does this! And that! And there's more. I talked with him quite a bit later in the show, and I have a good idea how this product can fit into our Two-Way-Web strategy, and this guy is easy to work with. Ken came from Symantec, and his partners, in Korea, have one of the few remaining word processors after Office cleared the productivity market. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="He wanted me to take his picture with Steve Ballmer, he knows he's going to get the first class treatment from Microsoft, and I think this will be fun. We can carve out a position for Ken in the Web Apps market, and tilt the table in his favor. Competition is good! Even for Microsoft. (Especially for Microsoft.)&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="After some discussion, I decided it would be OK to show &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't want to include it with the other products, it's a little touchy, I needed a little time to jump from the role of inquisitive student and JLG-clone to the role of product demoer. Tim O'Reilly who was in the audience, and clearly enjoying himself, asked about XML-RPC, &quot;Show me where it is,&quot; he said, or at least that's how I interpreted what he said.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So I went to my test site, dave.editthispage.com, the place where I try out new features and do demos from. I don't like to use Scripting News as a demo, because it's a real site to me. Having a for-play-only site makes sense. I showed them how I flip the home page to start a new day, and use the Edit This Page button to make a change. Then I reviewed the menu commands at the top of each page, and took a dive into the Preferences system, landing on the search prefs. An interesting little place. You enter the IP address of the search engine server, the port the search software is running on, the name of the procedure to call, and the path to send the HTTP POST command to. Anyone running a Web server would understand what this means. I said that all the major search engine companies had said no to supporting this protocol, but Brian Behlendorf of the Apache Group was in the audience smiling and nodding his head. I never did find out why this pleased him so much.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Then we all talked for a bit, and then the session was over.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A Job Well Done, I said in a follow-up email to my fellow panelists.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What a nice way to launch an industry!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Competition is good for our users. I said this so many times in Phoenix, in relation to the patent issue. Competition is good! Say that 18 times until you believe it. It makes you stronger. Rise to it, accept the challenge, don't run away. You learn the most from your competitors, and vice versa. It's the most intimate relationship you can have in the business world.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So since we're going to have competition, I believe we must take extra steps to guarantee that there's no customer lock-in. It's even more important in the age of the Web when the user might not even have a copy of their own data. One of the cardinal requirements of this market, even before we try to get the UIs compatible, is an export function that leaves un-rendered text and data on the user's hard disk in a format readable by software that's available at a reasonable or no cost. UserLand will make this an issue in this market. We're not fully there yet, but we will be shortly. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I know Dan Bricklin understands this. He invented the DIF format for exchanging spreadsheet data in the early 80s, which became the standard exchange format for numeric data. The customers insisted on it, and they will again, as will the magazine reviewers, when they start reviewing web apps. The users own the data, and it must be made available for other apps to work with. Closed apps must be opened, and since this is a new market, let's have it be that way right from the start.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;10&quot;&gt;The scene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="There were so many interesting people in the room. Michael Schrage from the MIT Media Lab. Mike Weiner who I knew from the Thesaurus Wars of the mid-late 80s. Turns out he's a patent expert. Others I have mentioned, the ever-grinning Jakob Nielsen, Tim O'Reilly who thought the Web Apps should be on the main stage, and Esther Herself who said most people wouldn't understand. I love Esther, but..&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Was this the beginning of an industry? Perhaps. There were other Web Apps at Esther's, including the new Kleiner-Perkins startup Firedrop, and Desktop.Com, which is more gutsy than even Ken Rhie's ThinkFree. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If we get another larger meeting together, perhaps its own conference, I want to be part of it. I would be very happy to play the same role I played in Phoenix. This was one of the best sessions I ever moderated. I had as much fun as I had at the Can Apple Survive? panel at Seybold in 1997 (which I think helped save the publishing market for Apple) and the private session we had at Microsoft in 1998 where we designed XML-RPC. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I like moderating groups of people. When I'm the only one on stage I don't know who to talk to. I've tried little tricks to pretend I'm conversing with a particular audience member, but I get in my head and it doesn't come through very well. But give me a group of people and I can make them shine, and give the audience their moneys-worth. I do this better than anything else I do, including writing essays and software.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Touch of grey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="And thanks to Esther. It had been fourteen years since I had been on the PC Forum stage. Ever the graceful host, Esther said &quot;Welcome back Dave.&quot; Indeed. It was a thrill. There'll be more to say later, for example I spent ten minutes with Whoopi Goldberg at the show. And I bonded with David Ellington of Netnoir. And reconnected with my old friend Fred Davis, who is making a solid transformation from journalist to CEO of Lumeria. And the list goes on and on.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="One meeting stands out. At dinner on Monday night, I was at a table with a group of AT&amp;T expatriots. After Whoopi spoke (where did she get the name Whoopi? What about Goldberg?) after the dinner was finished, a Lucent exec, Mary Whelan, who had been beaming at me the whole dinner (I didn't know why) shook my hand, and said she used to get DaveNets forwarded to her by Kevin Compton at AT&amp;T but wasn't getting  them anymore. No problem I said, may I have your card. Then she thanked me for my eulogy of Jerry Garcia back in 1995. I was stirred by this. Imagine a big company exec, sharing a sadness and a celebration of a man who now is long dead, as cold as Benjamin Franklin or anyone else who's been gone for many years. What a lovely experience. When I got back to my room I re-read the piece, and a little spot in my heart healed again. &quot;Appreciate, respect and celebrate every person you can. Now is the time to have fun! Tomorrow they may be gone.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry&quot;&gt;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That may be the theme of Esther's for me this year. Fourteen years is a long time to be gone. Many of my friends weren't there this year, and the ones who were, are fourteen years older. The hair is graying, the middles are getting larger, my friends are getting old, and I guess so am I. And many, some who I loved, weren't there. Goodbye old friends! &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Dan Bricklin took a great picture of me, smiling! Yeah, I guess I look like Jerry. I like it. Thanks Dan!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://danbricklin.com/log/1f47e9c0.jpg&quot;&gt;http://danbricklin.com/log/1f47e9c0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Good news. Esther's used to be a place of fear for me, but I'm happy to report, not any more. I'm a dean now. One of the survivors.There are still bright eyes, some of them in old bodies, some in young. Where ever they are, they are inspiration. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There's a spark out there. Let's be who we are. We used to be young, that was great. Now we're older, and soon for some us the clock will run out. No doubt there will be more missing friends. And more space for new trees to grow! Onward. With love.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="Touch of grey">
				<outline text="I wrote the last piece, &quot;Touch of grey&quot;, without having recently listened to this Grateful Dead gem. After writing the piece I got so much great email from Deadheads. "/>
				<outline text="You'd be surprised who loves Jerry. Much of the really good stuff in servers, tools, browsers, user interface and animation is created by people with long hair, beards, loud laughs, who listen to Grateful Dead music."/>
				<outline text="&quot;We will get by. We will survive.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is a hippie?">
				<outline text="In the 60s being a hippie meant being a kid, a draft resister, a drug user, having sex often and not necessarily getting married, but today being a hippie means being middle-aged, and more often than not, a voter, a software user, and quite possibly a software developer. "/>
				<outline text="Hippies go to Esther's, W3C and IETF meetings, hippies even go to Davos. Hippies talk to Joel Klein, and hippies run some of the largest companies. Many of the big venture capitalists are closet Deadheads, and some, like Roger McNamee, aren't even in the closet. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.integralcapital.com/aboutus/roger.php3 "/>
				<outline text="&quot;Every silver lining has a touch of gray.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="Trust">
				<outline text="Hippies said &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot; With good reason!"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Oh well a touch of grey kind of suits you anyway.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Was JFK a hippie?">
				<outline text="To me, being a hippie means having a mind and a heart, and remembering to dance when you get the chance."/>
				<outline text="If JFK had lived, would he have been a hippie? "/>
				<outline text="&quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Isn't that an interesting question!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Your country needs your help">
				<outline text="If you're a citizen of the US, your country needs your help, whether or not you're a hippie."/>
				<outline text="The US Patent and Trademark Office is out of control. Check this out. Patent 6,025,810, issued on 2/15/00, defines an apparatus for making light travel faster than the speed of light. "/>
				<outline text="This is ridiculous. We're giving the lawyers license to run the technology business, without regulation, and they're insane. Do you know what a patent is? It's a legal monopoly. We don't have much to worry about devices that make light travel faster than the speed of light. But much of the technology conversation is being determined by lawyers now. This is what you get when lawyers invent technology."/>
				<outline text="&quot;I know the rent is in arrears. The dog has not been fed in years. It's even worse than it appears.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="You need competition">
				<outline text="This message is to every exec, board member and venture capitalist who is filing patents to protect their businesses from competition. You can't survive without competition. There are so many reasons. For example, if your rollout is a dud, like so many are, a competitor's launch can revive your category. "/>
				<outline text="Further, a competitor probes the users' minds, and figures out what they want, and if you're struggling to figure that out, you can use all the help you get. I've been competed with. Young entrepreneurs are afraid of it, but us older folk who are now wiser, know that the conversation between competitors can be most illuminating and valuable. It's what moves markets forward. Without that conversation, when it's a single lone vendor, the market dies. Just ask IBM how the PS/2 went. Do they still make them? (I don't think so.) What about the PCjr? Remember that product when you think about the value of competition. What if we *had* to use the PCjr because IBM had a legal monopoly on home computers??"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Firedrop">
				<outline text="At Esther's, a company I was familiar with, Firedrop, rolled out. I had signed a non-disclosure agreement, a rare thing for me, because at the time we were in discussion with Kleiner-Perkins on working with UserLand, and Firedrop had not yet announced. They wanted to know if their product was related to our business. "/>
				<outline text="I honored the agreement, but once the product was announced and released I was free to look at their site along with my readers, and found an interesting product on a colorful website, in an area I was uncertain about, but interested in. Would Web users want it? I find HTML email interesting. We do it at UserLand. I wondered if we should compete. And I wondered how Firedrop, who advertises a suite of patent applications, would respond to competition."/>
				<outline text="So we took a careful look. I sent a few Firedrop messages to friends. I'm going to keep trying to come up with compelling Firedrop applications. It looks like an idea that was well-explored by the makers of QuickMail, CE Software, more than ten years ago. John Foster, the QuickMail product manager, says that users liked the demos, but stuck to plain old email, it was empowering enough, and most people don't have time to design complex forms and databases to gather results, and even worse, people who receive the form-mails don't know what to do with them. Is it a viral app, as Firedrop says it is? The QuickMail experience says it's not."/>
				<outline text="Now if I choose to compete, Firedrop would get a boost, for sure. With all possible humility, I'm a really good software designer. My apps get used. That's not an accident, because I go to a lot of trouble trying ideas out and only stick with ones that leverage people's time and tickle their minds, ones that can gain traction and grow. "/>
				<outline text="We need competition because that's where the really good ideas come from. It often takes two or three launches to get it right, even if conventional wisdom in Internet investing says that you only get one shot. You can't fight reality in technology, you usually have to iterate, in other words, you can't actually make light travel faster than the speed of light."/>
				<outline text="I hope our venture capitalists are funding with more reality these days, companies that shut the lights on competition violate cardinal rule #1 of the technology business --  you need competition, without it your idea dies."/>
				<outline text="&quot;I will survive.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Is Europe ripe?">
				<outline text="The US is applying pressure to European governments to follow the lead and start issuing patents on software and business processes. There may be an opportunity for one or more European governments to create a safe haven for technologists, free of the patent madness of the US."/>
				<outline text="Since my art is at issue, I'd move over this. While I admire JFK for his call to US citizens, I am part of the Web now, I'm part of something bigger, I have less in common with my fellow Americans. I choose to make software. Amazingly, to do that, I may soon need a safe haven outside the US."/>
				<outline text="A sad idea! What I want is simply to work with other people. I've said it so many times. That's what the Web is about to me, working together. The new patent issue destroys the that, at least in the US. It's a deal-stopper. Let's hope other countries don't follow suit, and let's try to fix the problem in the US."/>

			<outline text="Dave Winer">
				<outline text="PS: In the rush to get the last piece out I forgot to thank Kevin Werbach, the managing editor of the PC Forum conference. The panel I led was his design, he chose the products and presenters, I merely moderated the session. Kevin doesn't get enough credit for getting good ideas out to Esther's audience. Web applications belonged at PC Forum. Thanks Kevin, it was a pleasure working with you, and I hope we can do it again soon."/>

				<outline text="To me, the group that's left out in all the discussions are the people who have bet their livelihoods on the Web. People who create Web sites, and Web applications, and of course, people who use those sites and apps."/>
				<outline text="Any solution that doesn't have direct impact on their independence, and empowers their creativity will fail, in my humble opinion. This is where the rubber meets the road. "/>
				<outline text="The DOJ was wrong to focus on the hardware OEMs. They have shown no ability or inclination to innovate. It's not part of the formula of their industry. I've seen this confirmed over and over, even the freshly funded Linux clone vendors with permission to lose money, want to be nothing more than clone vendors, selling a commodity for thin margins (like Amazon). They're all going after Dell, a company that has never put anything interesting on a hard disk, even when they have the chance to. "/>
				<outline text="The DOJ takes a neophyte's view of the Web, and focuses on the main thing a non-technologist can see, the hardware. It's not the freedom of the hardware that counts, it's the freedom of the minds of the creative people."/>
				<outline text="However, I agree with the DOJ that Microsoft has to learn again how to compete. They only remember the way they used to compete before they became a dominant company. The message, so clear, that Microsoft really isn't hearing, is that the way they compete is unacceptable. "/>

				<outline text="This is the cleanest way out of the mess, and I think it would address the concerns about Microsoft's mismanagement of the competition with Netscape. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/10/00; 7:14:41 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="Apparently, last week Microsoft did private press briefings with reporters from publications such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/04/biztech/articles/08next.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsweek.com/nw-srv/printed/us/bz/a18441-2000apr9.htm&quot;&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; on their &quot;Next Generation Windows Services&quot; or NGWS project. "/>
				<outline text="I have been peripherally involved in this project, as one of the co-authors of the SOAP spec, which according to Charles Fitzgerald of Microsoft is the underlying &quot;fabric&quot; of NGWS."/>
				<outline text="The articles that have appeared so far cast NGWS as all Microsoft stories are cast. The big lumbering aggressive gorilla moves, and the small folk, including (always) Sun's Bill Joy, scream foul. It's a familiar loop. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Courage?">
				<outline text="When we started the work with Microsoft, a little over two years ago, I said in a private email to Bill Gates that this was the most courageous thing that I had ever seen any platform vendor do. Two years later, now it's beginning to roll out, and I'd have to take away a few of the courage points, but still, if we keep an open mind, it may be one of the miracles of the Internet. A platform vendor giving up lock-in, because NGWS is built on the open standards of the Internet, XML and HTTP. If that's what's actually happening, it's the spirit of the Internet being embraced by the ultimate embracer, Mr. Gates."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Web is exhausted">
				<outline text="We support what remains of Netscape, in the last few days we've done a lot of quick work to connect our innovations with theirs. But despite Netscape's mostly noble efforts, it's largely a one-browser world now, and we believe, based on experience that that means that not much interesting will happen in the future in the browser. The Web is what it is, not much more will happen. I'd love to be wrong about this, but that's how I'm betting."/>
				<outline text="We support Netscape in the hope that it will stimulate Microsoft to do some developer-driven stuff with MSIE. And in the last piece I called for the removal of MSIE from Microsoft to create a once-again competitive market, but these are both just &lt;i&gt;attempts&lt;/i&gt; to bring back competitiveness. Neither of them are sure to do it."/>
				<outline text="But desktop apps are a whole other story. It's a virgin playing field. I am confident that patents won't play a role here because UserLand has already released a beta of the key breakthrough in this area. We have not (at this time) filed a patent application with the USPTO. We may still do it, we have a year from the release of the software to file. A lot of this depends on how the patent conversation evolves on the Web."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Two years to get our act together">
				<outline text="The two year lull gave us, my company, UserLand, a chance to get our act together. Like Microsoft, we're rolling out a new vision for the Web, one that's based not only on open standards, but also the power of desktop apps. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Jumping with no parachute">
				<outline text="Dale Dougherty of O'Reilly tells a Jumping-With-No-Parachute story that's better than any I've heard before. Man jumps out of plane with no parachute. Plane cuts its engine and goes into a nosedive. Door stays open. Before both crash and die, the man goes back into the door and straps himself in. Plane powers up, regains altitude. Now that's guts!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why DaveNet changed">
				<outline text="I got email from Steve Jurvetson and Tim O'Reilly and many others urging me not to change the form of presentation of DaveNet. I appreciate these comments, because it implies that someone is reading what I'm writing. But email delivery of newletters is a very small part of what we do. And in the future, while there will be a way to receive my writing via email, if you just read my words in email, with no context, it will not make any sense at all. "/>
				<outline text="I feel like we've already gotten to the disconnection point, that's why you see the change now. The comments I receive back from DaveNets, when I receive them, usually are missing the context of the piece. Private conversations I have with DaveNet subscribers, who diligently read them, confirm this. Our work in web applications surprises them. &quot;Write about it in DaveNet!&quot; they say. But I have I have."/>
				<outline text="Further, when a great story comes along that we have participated in, like the one developing with SOAP and NGWS, my point of view, that of a small but powerful independent developer, does not get included in the story. Bill Joy, Sun's chief technologist, always does, even though he hasn't shipped any software (that I know of) in twenty years. He pisses on our work. Says it's about Microsoft when it's not. So I'm taking a tactic from Joy's playbook. If I want your respect, I think I have to do two things. First, I must become more scarce. There's not much respect for someone who is so available. And second, I must make you come to me, on the Web, where the story is unfolding, on a daily basis. You have to feel a need for your fix, and make an investment in getting it."/>
				<outline text="Now I know I will lose a few readers. That's the way it goes. On a normal day I lose a few, and gain a few. Further, and this is a key point, it is not my goal to have the most readers. My goal is to create a new environment where small developers have a chance to produce software that millions of people use, without interference from large companies or the US government. I want to be one of those developers. "/>
				<outline text="I've been playing it wrong. I've been acting as if I want a lot of readers. My new tactic is to tell a great story using the medium that I love and understand, and if I gain a great audience so much the better. (I already have a great audience, btw.) If my users, people who write for the Web, gain larger audiences, that's OK too. And if people who use other people's software gain larger audiences, guess what, I like that too. (But I don't want it all to come from one developer.)"/>
				<outline text="My investment is in my medium, not in my name. &quot;Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet.&quot; It seems that some of my readers don't agree. Well, if it's too much trouble to visit my site, we're not singing the same tune. For six years I've pumped bits into your email box. That's a long long time. Now it's time for you to do something good for the Internet. "/>
				<outline text="Read, think, evaluate, open your mind, and come to the Web, where it's all happening. I don't just want your eyeballs, I want your minds. I'm willing to give up a few readers to get that."/>

SOAP v1.1 was released. It's a beautiful spec, a revolutionary technology, it's not what most people expect from Microsoft, and further, it's not just from Microsoft. In the last round of development, IBM and Lotus worked with us, and gained co-authorship status. This time, even Sun is not dissing the spec. In a News.Com report, a Sun exec said the company will support SOAP if it becomes a Web standard. &quot;There's a lot of appeal (to SOAP) because it's so easy to use,&quot; said Anne Thomas Manes, Sun's director of business strategy. Surprise!"/>
				<outline text="We have totally enjoyed working with Microsoft, and we very much look forward to a partnership with IBM. It's a strange world, where a tiny company such as UserLand can have so much clout. It's the world I wanted for years, where the quality of your thinking and the power of your ideas count more than the company you work for. This makes sense. It's gratifying and it's great. Thanks Microsoft and thanks IBM."/>
				<outline text="Such a milestone could not pass without sending an email to the people who I've communicated with for so many years. There will be many more reports and photos from Europe and elsewhere as we go on the road to tell the story of the Internet as an application platform."/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon!">
				<outline text="Earlier today UserLand, Ariba, Commerce One, Compaq, Developmentor, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, IONA, Lotus, Microsoft and SAP jointly proposed to the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) a new protocol called the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) that will allow new applications connecting desktop applications to Internet servers using the standards of the Internet, HTTP and XML."/>

				<outline text="Includes quotes from Tod Nielsen, Tim O'Reilly, Noah Mendelsohn, Kevin Werbach, Jakob Nielsen, Doc Searls, Fredrik Lundh and Paul Everitt."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Comments">
				<outline text="Standardized distributed computing protocols will make it easier for developers of Web applications to integrate functionality with each other. For example, membership information can be exchanged between sites from different companies, running in different server environments. I believe this will have an effect on the structure of the Internet industry, as companies implementing standardized interfaces have opportunities to acquire or merge with companies they are compatible with."/>
				<outline text="Further, the philosophy of SOAP is no lock-in. If one vendor implements a SOAP interface for a Web application, then that application can be replaced by a competitive service that supports an equivalent interface. Microsoft, as the dominant operating system vendor and a serious competitor in the server operating system business, is to be commended, in UserLand's opinion, for taking a  leading role in this area. Other developers of server operating systems are encouraged to support SOAP, and accept the no lock-in challenge. This will be good news for customers and for developers of network applications."/>
				<outline text="UserLand is playing a leading role in the deployment of network applications that interface through XML-over-HTTP. We already have four full network apps, Manila, MailToTheFuture, a preferences distribution system and a search engine that are scriptable through these protocols. We have dozens of littler ones, this technology has basically become a standard part of our development process. As far as we know, we are at this time the only developer to have deployed public applications that are accessible in this way. All our interfaces are open, publicly documented and subject to competition, which is welcome."/>
				<outline text="I have the zeal of a True Believer, I think that this is what the Grown Up Web was meant to be, combining the best that HTTP has to offer and great server operating systems, and the best that the desktop has to offer in tools and user interfaces."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What the Web Wants&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/8/00; 5:45:48 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="Today, after reading and pointing to editorials about yesterday's Microsoft decision in the New York Times, Washington Post, San Jose Mercury News, Seattle Times, and San Francisco Chronicle, I felt that one point of view was missing, the view from the Web. "/>
				<outline text="That's the purpose of this piece, to explain what (I think) the Web wants to happen here. It isn't what the court wants, and it isn't what Microsoft wants."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What the Web wants">
				<outline text="The court's decision, and to a lesser extent Microsoft, views the software world through old glasses. Lumping all Microsoft applications, including the browser, into a single company is senseless. A more useful dividing line is old versus new. In 1993, a shift began in the personal computer software business, instead of dominating the whole market, as Microsoft did briefly between 1990 and 1993, it became a three-part market, web-server, web-workstation and web-client; and Microsoft did not dominate any of these markets."/>
				<outline text="Along comes Netscape, an opportunist, packaging part of Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a networked writing environment (the reading part), and with great success, builds a community of developers and users, and ignites a firestorm of growth that only now is slowing, and I believe slowing only temporarily, while an investment community drunk with unprecedented profits, comes back to earth and in a sense, now the real work of creating the Web begins. "/>
				<outline text="Netscape, a visible symbol, was one of the most poorly managed companies we've ever seen in this industry. There are good reasons to believe, that even without Microsoft's unfair and overly aggressive competition, that they would have self-destructed. When they released their browser as open source, an act of desperation, Netscape was the most-used browser on the Internet, Microsoft was number two. In selling out they sold out the medium that developed around their browser, and we were lucky to have Microsoft there to pick up the ball, and to act as a balance against the growing power (even dominance) of AOL. "/>
				<outline text="(AOL could help settle this issue by making a commitment to Netscape, which it owns. So far AOL has largely been silent on the future of the Netscape browser. I asked Steve Case about this at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$156&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; in Davos. Their bundling deal with Microsoft prevents them from making a commitment to the Netscape browser, he explained. Such double-talk, easy to settle. And what a difference strong support for the Web from AOL would make.) "/>
				<outline text="Yet today it's still largely a one-browser world. I've asked this question at every speaking engagement I've had in the last two months. &quot;Is this a workable situation?&quot; My opinion is that it is not. Without competition, Microsoft is unlikely to improve the browser in ways that are meaningful to Web users, developers and businesses. The court is right to be concerned that Microsoft will tie its dominance of the browser market to gain dominance in related markets, the explosive ones that are fueling so much growth. This is the question that must be addressed in the change that's coming. "/>
				<outline text="Crippling Microsoft is not a good idea, but enabling competition in the browser market is fair and essential. The court has said that it does not trust Microsoft, neither does the Web. If Microsoft people reflect on this, there's a discomfort in having no competition in this vital space, but regardless of how Microsoft feels about this, something must be done, and the Jackson remedy does not address it. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Separate the browser, Windows apps on Unix">
				<outline text="In previous pieces I've called on the parties to settle on a compromise. Instead of splitting Microsoft  along OS vs application lines, do a more modest split, remove the browser from Microsoft, creating an independent company to continue the work of Netscape. The new company, call it BrowserCo, would be allowed to make an operating system, but Microsoft would not be allowed to make a Web browser, until a competitive market developed, and then only under very restrictive conditions."/>
				<outline text="It's a relatively small job to add APIs to Windows to allow the HTML rendering engine (another way of describing a Web browser) to be a plug-in. The user would be offered a choice of browsers, none of which would be pre-installed with Windows. The BrowserCo browser would be on the list, but it could not be the first choice for ten years, to allow the browser market to recover."/>
				<outline text="Further, Microsoft would have two years to make software that allows Windows applications to run on Unix systems. This transition would address the larger issue of Microsoft's control of application development, based on the assumption that non-HTML-based software will play an important role in the future of the Web. This is no longer much of a theory, since chat, email, games, and Napster-like products all run outside of the browser. Many more such applications are coming."/>
				<outline text="Today, an open source project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winehq.com/&quot;&gt;WINE&lt;/a&gt;, does a good job of running Windows apps on Linux. With two years help from Microsoft, parity could be reached, and Microsoft's dominance in native apps would be erased, without a major disruption in the market or inside Microsoft, or in the Web developer world. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Realistic and fair">
				<outline text="These remedies are realistic and fair. The punishment fits the crime, and the structural issues are cleared for the Web to go forward, where it wants to go, not where the government says it wants to go, or Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="Perhaps the most important aspect of the remedy is that it does not tilt the table in favor of competitors like Sun and AOL, which would not be a positive outcome. We don't want competitors bringing their case to the courts on a regular basis, we want a market that embraces competition, and routes around outages. The outcome must not favor Sun or AOL in any way, in fact, since they behave much like Microsoft in the market, they must accept some of the pain of the resolution. "/>
				<outline text="I believe this remedy should be acceptable to Microsoft, now that they've had a chance to see the remedy that will be imposed on them if they don't come to the table with a serious proposal. The plaintiffs will have their victory, which they deserve, and our thanks for helping us fix the problem with the Web that has existed since the unweblike opportunists, including Microsoft, moved in."/>
				<outline text="I encourage Microsoft to swallow the pill, as painful as it may be, there is no growth without pain. It's time for Microsoft to morph into a leader, one that cares about the ecology of the environment they exist in. Unchecked, Microsoft is a dangerous element in our market. With a softer approach, one with limits, Microsoft can morph to become a true leader, and help us get to a place where computers are mere tools (not expressions of power) which, imho, is all they were ever meant to be."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="To Bill Gates">
				<outline text="Bill, I was in the audience in Davos earlier this year when you announced the $750 million gift to the health of the world's children. This was a poignant moment for me, I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet&quot;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;. But there's a point I have not written about."/>
				<outline text="Some of your generosity must now be directed towards the industry you helped create. It's not OK to make us wait for you to attain a personal victory. Speeches about prevailing, or appealing, are leading to a conclusion that's hurting all of us. You could have woken up to this at any point in the last six years. Stop fighting. Give. Say uncle and mean it. And then do it again and again. (We all do it, that's what life is about.)"/>
				<outline text="The desktop computer market is your home, but it's one you share with many millions of people. Your wealth can help solve important problems like immunization. That's great. But your leverage is much higher here, now. "/>
				<outline text="You have been reluctant to lead our industry. At times, you've taken a stand, now it's time to up the ante. It's time to have a vision, to be a leader that takes us somewhere we want to go."/>
				<outline text="Bill, charity begins at home. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Final note">
				<outline text="The US government is not a friend of the Web."/>
				<outline text="In formulating this settlement, I took that into consideration. Two branches of the US government,  Congress and the Executive, passed and signed the Communication Decency Act, which was later overturned by the Judicial branch as unconstitutional. This act, had the court not rejected it, would have destroyed the Web as a medium of free expression. I am not so naive as to believe they did not understand this. "/>
				<outline text="The US government has also crippled the Internet by placing export restrictions on encryption software. The installed base of email software has no effective way of identifying the sender of a message, or keeping the content of messages private. The technology to do this has existed for over a decade, and if it weren't for the control of US government, I believe it would be universally deployed now. "/>
				<outline text="Further, the US government, while it's decrying the lack of competition created by a dominant software vendor, is issuing paper monopolies to a hoard of greedy opportunists, destroying any semblance of competitiveness in the industry they profess to care about so much. "/>
				<outline text="A complete examination of this case, all sides of it, exposes a corrupt system, based on lies, and control and greed. The purpose of the Web is to route around all that, to enable the power of the individual, and to undermine the power of the old to control the new."/>
				<outline text="I want the Web to be the winner in this case, and that requires an adjustment of the remedy. Instead of destroying Microsoft, let's do something that enables the power of the new public communication space, the World Wide Web."/>

				<outline text="Switching gears, but not really..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What does open source have in common with Java? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Both are former panaceas. Like object oriented programming in the late 80s, if adopted, they would supposedly lead to magic synergies known only to the promoters, and breathlessly replayed by reporters looking for an easy story to repeat over and over and over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Java was (and is) Pascal reincarnated. A virtual machine that ran on real machines. Good idea. Been done before. Open source is a tradition that dates back at least thirty years, if not longer. If you learned how to program in the 70s your teacher was quite possibly the source code for Unix (that's how I learned). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Fodder for the hype machine, these &quot;trends&quot; make some people rich, and take the focus off what's really happening, which is still the Web. Then they fade out, to be replaced by the next vaccuous trend, and in the meantime, most developers work hard, outside the spotlight, to make their users happy. (That includes open source developers, btw.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The thing that's truly offensive about these panaceas is that they are so exclusive and disrespectful of other developers. Until Sun &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2033523.html?tag=st.ne.1002.lthd.1003-200-2033523&quot;&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; SOAP, the only Sun-endorsed way to communicate with Java apps was to convert your whole program to Java. The Java evangelists would cheerfully and seriously tell you to do this. Same with open source. Unless you shipped all your source on their terms the wall was insurmountable. These are outages of the first order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="When will we learn the lesson, that predates even the Internet, that all outages in software are eventually routed around. Try to control and you lose your place. The time-of-control is shortening all the time. IBM had a 20 year run. DEC was the leader for 10 years. Microsoft, for four, at most. Java had an even more brief run and it was over before Java could actually do anything that anyone wanted to do. If you're a student of technology history, the long-shot bet of being dominant looks worse and worse. Even if you manage to attain dominance, briefly, who wants to be the trend of last year? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thankfully the open source rage is on its last legs. If you're honest and made a bet on open source, and want to get help from the press and investors, here's some open source (free) advice. Play it down. &quot;Oh that's an open source play&quot; they will say, shaking their heads as they look for something else to hype. Like B2C and B2B, it's last year's trend. Avoid those trends like the plague. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;trendfree&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One day the trend may be trend-free. That will be an interesting day, as we all struggle to prove that our software is 100 percent pure and free of all trends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Some trends are real&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="Even so, some trends are real, and almost all trends have some value in them, but it's not always where it seems to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The Web is real. Its revolution is that it enabled power users to become developers, and writers to become publishers. A network programming language with a very easy ramp. We had been looking for this, and hats off to Tim Berners-Lee for finding the magic formula.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Another trend that's real -- GUIs. How many people use command-line interfaces these days? A very small minority. At one time almost everyone who used a computer typed commands on a virtual line printer, or &quot;glass teletype.&quot; GUIs, in the form of Mac and Windows, had staying power, obviously. They changed the way we work with computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Even Java and open source have real value. Java has become a popular server-side programming language now that it's no longer a religious movement, and open source has focused attention on the basic generosity of programmers, but it isn't as exclusive a club as the promoters would have you believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Napster is real&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="Another thing that's real is Napster. For a moment, ignore the legal controversy. What's truly wonderful about Napster is that it's bringing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe&quot;&gt;power of the server&lt;/a&gt; to the desktop, in a mass market way. The technology of Napster is super interesting. It's the politics that gets the headlines though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="You won't hear me criticize the press for reporting on Napster. I believe in it. We plan to put a product in this space, without the legal implications. An authoring tool that has a built-in Web server, and is easier to use than anything that's come before, in my humble opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Patents in perspective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="Reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;id=1800019665&amp;cf=prod&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of how The Sixth Sense came together, I realize I may have made the wrong career choice. Perhaps I should have been a screen writer, because in the movie industry, the best people work with other best people, on a regular basis. Sure, it's a screwed up industry, but at least no one can take out a patent on a story idea. (Or can they?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Whatever. Let's rush to build the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/03/02/theTwowayweb&quot;&gt;Two-Way Web&lt;/a&gt;, asap, before the opportunists patent all the good ideas. And if you support developers who don't patent, one of the best things you can do is give them credit for their inventions, and do this carefully and completely. Almost all creative people want recognition for the risks they take. When they are generous with their ideas and don't patent them, extra recognition is a good idea. This is something positive everyone can do to encourage generosity from developers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Note to email readers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="I may have found a formula that allows me to write for the Web and email. I've let the last two pieces rest on the Web for 24 hours before publishing them via email. I've written a new script that makes it easier for me to send the emails. The only problem I haven't solved is nasty email in response. Some problems are out of my power to solve, and this is probably one of them. Onward!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Other news&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="There's new activity in &quot;RSS&quot;, the syndication format designed by UserLand and Netscape. And XML-RPC now has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;validator&lt;/a&gt; to be sure the implementations interoperate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;SOAP&quot;, which is the descendent of XML-RPC that we worked on with Developmentor and Microsoft, and then IBM, has a new supporter, Sun Microsystems. This one blew me away. Has hell frozen over too? &quot;;-&gt;&quot; Seriously, welcome Sun and thanks for the support!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Manila users now have &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Themes&lt;/a&gt; so even if you're not a great designer you can still have a site that was designed by one. And Frontier 6.2, which is totally ISP-ready, is inches from shipping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;How to Settle the Microsoft Case&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/16/00; 6:32:24 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="Yesterday I had a long talk with Brent Schlender, senior editor at Fortune. He spent eight days this month at Microsoft learning about NGWS, which will be formally announced next Thursday. "/>
				<outline text="As with many conversations about Microsoft these days, this one wound up in court. Schlender, who has covered Microsoft since their IPO in 1987, senses that they're rushing the announcement, in preparation for a court-imposed breakup. I asked if he had any direct quotes, he said not, it was just an impression."/>
				<outline text="I said it's a shame that this situation is causing so much trouble at Microsoft. I sense it too. I was at Microsoft on Tuesday, and we had a Scripting News dinner in Seattle on Tuesday night, attended by quite a few Microsoft people, and the court decision and the trouble it's causing was totally on the front-burner. It's a shame because the problem could be solved now, before it gets much worse, which it will, imho, if Microsoft continues to fight."/>
				<outline text="I wanted to write a short piece, but this is getting long. To the point, I want to re-state a solution, in more detail, based on several conversations I've had in the last week. By all parties, I mean not just the defendent and the plaintiffs, but also users and developers, and possibly taxpayers. We could turn this lemon into lemonade. I believe there's a way to resolve the dispute, leaving Microsoft strong, and leaving the rest of the industry with a lot of new opportunity. "/>
				<outline text="The basic premise -- I do not want to see Microsoft destroyed. But they're going to have to give up something that matters to them to keep that from happening."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Part one: BrowserCo">
				<outline text="Instead of splitting Microsoft along OS vs application lines, do a more modest split, remove the browser from Microsoft, creating an independent company to continue the work of Netscape. The new company, call it BrowserCo, would be allowed to make an operating system, but Microsoft would not be allowed to make a Web browser, until a competitive market developed, and then only under very restrictive conditions."/>
				<outline text="It's a reasonably small engineering job to add APIs to Windows to allow the HTML rendering engine to be a plug-in. The user would be offered a choice of browsers, none of which would be pre-installed with Windows. The BrowserCo browser would be on the list, but it could not be the first choice for five years, to allow the browser market to recover."/>
				<outline text="Further, three years after the divestiture, BrowserCo would be free to merge with or acquire other companies. The settlement would include enough cash to fund expanded development of the browser during that period. After three years, the two companies are completely separate, and management of BrowserCo will either find a business model, or be subject to fierce competition, or the industry will have moved on and HTML browsing will no longer be considered a key technology. No matter what, the lack of a competitive environment in HTML browsers will have been alleviated."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Mozilla">
				<outline text="There's a silver lining here, Mozilla. It's still a rough browser, but it's getting better, and like Microsoft, it's very focused on XML, and has a bunch of advantages over MSIE that relate to its ability to become more than just an HTML-over-HTTP browser. They also have an incredibly determined developer community, that like Microsoft, doesn't get as much respect as it deserves. If they sat down in a serious face-to-face, with no threat of anihilation, Microsoft people would find they have a lot in common with Mozilla people, and vice versa."/>
				<outline text="Remember that Mozilla is not owned by AOL. A browser-less Microsoft would be free to allocate resources to Mozilla and make it the first choice browser for Windows. That would possibly undermine BrowserCo, which would be very cool because it would enable competition, and would certainly get user and developer-oriented features into both browsers."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Part two: Windows apps on Unix">
				<outline text="Part two of the proposed settlement -- Microsoft would have three years to make software that allows Windows applications to run on Unix systems. This transition would address the larger issue of Microsoft's control of application development, based on the assumption that non-HTML-based software will play an important role in the future of the Internet. This is no longer much of a theory, since chat, email, games, and Napster-like products all run outside of the browser. Many more such applications are coming."/>
				<outline text="Today, an open source project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winehq.com/&quot;&gt;WINE&lt;/a&gt;, does a good job of running Windows apps on Unix. With three years help from Microsoft, parity could be reached, and Microsoft's dominance in native apps would be erased, without a major disruption in the market or inside Microsoft, or in the developer world. I doubt if Microsoft would have much trouble recruiting an enthusiastic team of internal developers to work on this project. After all, it would be a key part of clearing the way for Microsoft to create new software, that runs everywhere, without supervision from lawyers. Microsoft truly does like to make software. Get rid of the politics, roll up your sleeves, we'll all help with this."/>
				<outline text="Note that getting Windows apps to run well on Unix would also give the Macintosh parity, since Apple is transitioning to a version of Unix in an upcoming version of the Macintosh OS."/>
				<outline text="This is all the divestment that's needed to address Microsoft's dominance of the operating system market, and it leaves Microsoft relatively whole, there's no split required along OS versus application lines, which has always been a vexing issue for the software industry, dating back well over two decades. What is an application and what is an OS? That's not such a simple question."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The smoking gun">
				<outline text="Microsoft's dwindling group of supporters always omit the smoking gun, the email by Microsoft exec Jim Allchin, where he says that competing on features with Netscape isn't working, and that Microsoft must use its Windows monopoly to win the war. Had Allchin been punished or fired for making such a statement, Microsoft would be in the clear. Instead, Microsoft actually used the strategy, and while Netscape was a troubled company, in the end Microsoft got the market share it sought. In other words, the strategy, which is clearly illegal, appears to have worked."/>
				<outline text="Any thoughtful and reasonable person has to accept this, and that must include Microsoft management. That is what this case is about. Push all the rest of it aside, the case rests on this Microsoft practice, which until the trial, was theoretical. Now there's evidence and a judgment based on that evidence."/>
				<outline text="It would be unfair for the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to overturn the decision. To ignore it would leave the software and Internet industry at the mercy of Microsoft. They are a large company, but they're just one company, and the Internet is about more than companies, it's about free expression for individuals and other forms of human organization, that transcend the well-known limits of corporations."/>
				<outline text="In other words, there's more than technology happening here, and certainly more than one *brand* of technology, and ratification of the tying practice would result in a continued stifling of creativity and new structures for enterprise. If it were overturned, I'd argue, the taxpayers of the United States should get a lot of Microsoft stock, because we would be subsidizing them. We've probably been doing it for a long time, but now we have the means to stop it, not just at Microsoft, but at other market-dominating technology companies such as AOL and Oracle, and perhaps Sun and Apple. "/>
				<outline text="To give Microsoft a pass is to give one to all other technology vendors that dominate. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is Microsoft doing?">
				<outline text="Microsoft appears to have a dual personality. "/>
				<outline text="On one hand, they have been pioneering a new technology, that I have been closely involved with, that is truly revolutionary. Over the last few months it has gotten support from Sun and IBM, and many others, indicating that it's at least somewhat open. Something new and strange and possibly wonderful is going on, that would probably be brought to a halt or severely limited by a splitting of Microsoft. We need their attention, involvement and leadership as this technology moves forward. "/>
				<outline text="On the other hand, there's a self-destructive side of Microsoft, that appears to be willing to go down with the ship. The stakes are so high now, to Microsoft management, this isn't only about right and wrong anymore, it's about the survival of your company and the next generation Web. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="To the rest of us">
				<outline text="This is a great time to think. "/>
				<outline text="Do big corporations have a role as technology goes forward? If so, what is their role?"/>
				<outline text="What would you be willing to give up to have open and fair competition in all aspects of technology?"/>
				<outline text="What do you think?"/>

			<outline text="I found everything I wanted">
				<outline text="A couple of months ago I downloaded Napster, searched for a few of my favorites and found nothing. "/>
				<outline text="Yesterday I downloaded it again, and had a completely different experience. I found *everything* I wanted. I quickly built a music library, stuff that's either hard or impossible to find via retail music channels. "/>
				<outline text="I woke up giddy this morning, realizing that I would be working with Buddy Miles, Cyndi Lauper, Alvin Lee, Todd Rundgren, Jethro Tull, The Kinks and Annie Lenox, and probably anyone else I could think of. (Assuming the Napster servers stay up, they're having trouble with this.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The music industry">
				<outline text="It's hard to see how the music industry can put it back together. Their distribution system is busted. Even if they sue Napster out of existence, how are they going to get the MP3s off the users' hard disks? By appealing to their honesty? Hmmm. "/>
				<outline text="After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/&quot;&gt;Courtney Love&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arancidamoeba.com/mrr/problemwithmusic.html&quot;&gt;Steve Albini&lt;/a&gt;, I see they are screwed on the other side too. Who can back the music industry after understanding how they work with artists? Where does the money I pay for CDs go? Surprisingly, not to the artists."/>
				<outline text="A couple of years ago perhaps the music industry could have done something. They could have seen this coming, seen the conundrum they were walking into, and adjusted their economics accordingly. Now they argue right and wrong, which is tricky. They have no obligation to do the right thing themselves, but somehow everyone else, the artists and their fans, do. Enough of that."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A new medium">
				<outline text="There's opportunity here, but not the opportunity to control the connection between artist and fan. As always, that's what the Internet eliminates, the need for middlemen. "/>
				<outline text="What artist wouldn't accept a reasonable sponsorship from an Internet-based venue, one which allowed them to easily collect gratuities from their users, as Courtney Love describes? "/>
				<outline text="Why shouldn't such a company start right now?"/>
				<outline text="And remember that these are artists, they are vulnerable on a personal level. They have been screwed bigtime. We can't just send A&amp;R people to meet them, we have to send their counterparts from the software world. Let's talk art and money. Leave out the middlemen."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Where do I send the money?">
				<outline text="That's the key question. After learning the economics of the music industry, I no longer want to send money to the companies, I want to send it directly to the artists. Certainly no one can deny me the right to do that."/>
				<outline text="I want to make up for the brutality of the system they had to be part of. I want to make it right. I gave my money to the only people I could find to give money to. They told me they were giving the money to you, or at least they lead me to believe that. I am sorry I believed their lies."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Winer ">
				<outline text="PS: I also feel love for the Napster people. What a nice piece of software. If anyone from Napster is tuned in, an offer of help, moral, and technical. And thanks for having the courage to blow the door open. "/>
				<outline text="PPS: I wonder if AOL bought a bag of air when they merged with Time-Warner. How different it would be if AOL had acquired Napster."/>
				<outline text="PPPS: I had a debate with Roger Black on the keynote stage at Seybold in February. He argued for production values. I said I like production value, who doesn't, but I don't mind a rough cut, if I get new ideas and get a chance to dance to a different tune. "/>
				<outline text="PPPPS: As a Web developer using Napster, I immediately want a search engine and category system. I'd like to see the top 100 songs of 1971, with links to places I can listen to them. I want to publish a weblog, with pointers to stories people wrote about each song that moved me. Of course I want to hear the music while I'm reading. I want to meet and connect with other people who love the same music I do. I want them to show me new music that I can click on to listen to. I want music to be as easy as the Web. I don't mind paying for it, I pay for everything else I use."/>

			<outline text="More Microsoft!">
				<outline text="The following is conjecture based on hearsay and tea-leave-reading. I have not been briefed on Microsoft's overall vision, but I will attend the press conference tomorrow and will hear the official story then."/>
				<outline text="Tomorrow, in Redmond, Microsoft will announce their next-generation Internet strategy, formerly called NGWS, which has XML and SOAP at its core. (And of course respects the legacy, COM, ODBC, WebDAV.)"/>
				<outline text="Imagine a word processor integrated into the Web browser (MSIE of course) and a toolbar that makes it easy to switch to your presentation program, spreadsheet, schedule, contact list, mail app, draw program, etc. All with a consistent user interface, and deep integration with Web services, that the client talks to through SOAP."/>
				<outline text="And while the code for these apps resides on your local hard disk, they are updated automatically, presumably with user confirmation. You pay Microsoft for this software, but it's a subscription fee, not a traditional software license. (Just like Frontier!)"/>
				<outline text="Some of your stuff is publicly readable, some is not. All your information is stored on the server. So when you go on a trip, with a cellphone or a laptop, or are at a offsite, or a sales call, you can tap into the data, view it, edit it. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;http://howto.yahoo.com/infodesk/&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; with higher-level software running on the client. (This is what Gates talked about at &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet#8&quot;&gt;Davos&lt;/a&gt; in January, the PC is not irrelevant, he said, it's essential.)"/>
				<outline text="Their strategy is a compromise with the Network Computing vision that was the anti-Microsoft rage a few years ago, and will lock into Windows, but do it through documented interfaces, expressed in SOAP. So Microsoft will claim that it is open, and this will be fair, assuming that other developers support the idea not just &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1770721.html&quot;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2033523.html?tag=st.ne.1002.lthd.1003-200-2033523&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; but with software."/>
				<outline text="The software we will see tomorrow is &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/01/04/demoingsoftwareforfunprofi&quot;&gt;demo-ware&lt;/a&gt;. The project started in a rush, early this year, when Gates &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/01/13/billGatesStepsDownAsMicrosoftCeo&quot;&gt;stepped&lt;/a&gt; out of the CEO slot and become Microsoft's chief software architect. What we see tomorrow is pure Gates, circa 2000. And it's a new job for him, Microsoft has never had an overarching vision before, and perhaps they still don't. "/>
				<outline text="Of course lurking in the background is the possibility that Microsoft has filed patent applications on these ideas, which are somewhat unique (perhaps, esp in the areas where functionality is integrated with MSIE). The jury won't be out on that for a few years, because patent applications are confidential until they are issued by the USPTO. It would be helpful if Microsoft addressed this issue tomorrow, without waiting for a question from the audience."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is it called?">
				<outline text="Microsoft might call this product We Win, which is a cute pun. It's Windows for Workgroups, an idea without much gas that appeared in the early 90s, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a statement to Judge Jackson and Joel Klein. "/>
				<outline text="Or they might call it Wee Win, to say that it's much smaller than the current Windows/Office combo. Or Wheeee Win, which is the feeling of jumping out of the plane with no parachute while using Windows."/>

				<outline text="Given my current Web-centered writing routine, my Web readers know a lot more than the email readers. Let me catch you up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="On Thursday I went to Microsoft's Dot-Net announcement. I was covering the conference, real-time, updating Scripting News as the conference continued. The mood swings. Gates is Gates, he doesn't really smile, and this time the feeling (from the past) that he knows something that I don't isn't there for me. Subsequent speakers talk like Jeff Bezos, in outbursts of excitement, but with a sense that the enthusiasm is acting, not from the heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Then Ballmer comes on stage. What a great speaker! He shows humor and vulnerability, casting aside a cat-call from the audience in a loving paternal way. (From yours truly.) Somehow the slogan &quot;Happy Warrior&quot; applies, although Ballmer is nothing like Hubert Humphrey. As he spoke, I wrote into the Web, using the technology that was being talked about on stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="When Ballmer thanked me for working with them on the stuff they announced, my heart swelled, it felt great. Steven Levy, who writes for Newsweek, said later &quot;You're famous.&quot; I thought that's cool, now we can get some work done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Duality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="My journalist-developer duality, which was uncomfortable for a few years now feels just right. If I can be a journalist, so can everyone else. The ability to share a point of view openly without help from a PR firm is the right and responsibility of every CEO, imho. The better your company does this, the more effective you will be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I like to get out front, so if people are uncomfortable with a CEO who writes and influences others, let's go through that, because it's going to become more commonplace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="(And if you're a CEO who wants to do this, please get in touch with me, we can help.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.herring.com/insider/2000/0623/tech-microsoft062300.html?id=userland&quot;&gt;Red Herring&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Microsoft got a surprising plug from former competitor Marc Andreessen, who spent the afternoon calling media outlets to announce that his new software-services company, Loudcloud, was 'adopting the whole Microsoft stack, from top to bottom.'&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="To which I say, I wish we had gotten together on this when Netscape was strong. If only Netscape had embraced this vision, in 1998, we'd be further along now. Today it would be better if Marc would lend his good name today to a process that &lt;i&gt;includes&lt;/i&gt; Microsoft, but doesn't revolve around them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="In response to Marc's claim, there is no Microsoft stack. I'm pretty sure most of the &quot;media outlets&quot; understand this. Now understand how superficial the hype is. Good net standards involve opportunism, for sure, but they also require patience and balance, consideration of other points of view, and participation. Andreessen is a newbie here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;To Sun and IBM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="I was surprised, in a way, that Microsoft's announcements on Thursday didn't include Sun and IBM, both of whom have backed SOAP, which is the technology underlying Dot-Net.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="As a partner in the SOAP process, I want to extend a hand to these two companies, who have been instrumental in accelerating the adoption of SOAP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="IBM co-authored the spec and did the first implementation. Sun went through their more recent animosity with Microsoft, presumably seeing the good SOAP can do for Java, and endorsed it anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The processing continues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And now we swing around to the choice of name for this vision of Microsoft's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's so hard to type, and so hard to say, you can't put .NET in a story without completely screwing it up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Typography matters, even on the Web. If I mention .NET five times in a story, my reader's eye sees imbalance. In order for the name to be recognizable as a brand as you read a sentence, you have to capitalize it. All-cap words loom large and create imbalance. Much of the coverage has been awkward. How do I refer to this? Is it a product or a vision? Is it really a brand-name? Isn't .NET a pretty generic thing? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;What is Dot-Net?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="Pushing aside the statements of intent, what did Microsoft actually announce on Thursday?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I know what it is, but it's hard to explain if you don't have the prerequisite background. Let me try to explain by filling in the blanks. This column is written for non-technologists, so I have to start at the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Inside every computer there's a constant chatter of program modules asking other modules questions and getting back answers. Every mouse click launches thousands of these software conversations. Like any conversation, the conversants must agree on a language. If I don't know Italian, I can't understand much of what an Italian says. That's cool, sometimes ignorance is bliss. But I digress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We call these modules &quot;procedures&quot;. When one procedure asks a question of another procedure it's said to &quot;call&quot; it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now of course when we connect computers over a network all we're doing is making it possible for a procedure on one machine to call a procedure on another machine. These are called Remote Procedure Calls, or RPCs for short. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Until May it mattered very much which language each piece of software was written in, or what operating system it ran on. Java, Windows, Macintosh, they all talked different languages, so like an American in Italy, they could connect at some level (the Web) but to have a sophisticated conversation, there had to be a higher level agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Until May the conversation between technologists was more like a playground conversation. &quot;You have to use Java!&quot; said Sun. Microsoft said &quot;We like DCOM!&quot; and everyone else kicked back and waited for something interesting to happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="On the SOAP mail list, someone said &quot;This is all politics!&quot; and that's right. But that's not the same thing as saying it's pointless. SOAP, the common language we agreed to, is just enough BOGU for everyone, it's truly a miracle, because the sandbox argument was cast aside. The playground kids grew up. &quot;We'll work together,&quot; they said. &quot;Let's agree that this is the way procedure calls work over the Internet.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now, in this context, what is Dot-Net? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Microsoft says &quot;Now that we have a common language, this is what we want to talk about. Would anyone like to talk with us?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="(Hey, that's what I hear. You can choose to hear something else.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What do they want to talk about? Membership preferences, through Passport, for example. This raises a question. Do I want to give my personal information to Microsoft? Hmmm. I don't want to do that, at least not at this time. But can I agree with Microsoft how to do this? Absolutely, no problem with that. Can I operate a Passport-compatible server? Of course. Good idea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="(Let's have minimal and understandable docs. Lots of working sample code.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There are a bunch of other conversations they want to have, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/topics/f2k/whitepaper/default.asp&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; about them on the Microsoft Web site. Before going in too deep and getting lost in the details, that's all there is. We have a common language. Now we're going to start talking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Microsoft wants to talk about things that any Web technologist in 2000 would want to talk about. And of course we like talking with Microsoft because they have good technologists and lots of people use their software. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;The magic of SOAP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="It's worth noting, because it might otherwise be missed, that SOAP has had a magic life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Talking with one of my Microsoft co-authors, Mohsen Al-Ghosein, last week, he said he didn't like the way SOAP turned out. This should come as no surprise to Microsoft people, because Mohsen doesn't mind sharing his opinions. With Mohsen, Don Box and Bob Atkinson, I discovered something that had been eluding me my whole career. People *could* work cross-company. I had never seen it happen. Our minds worked together, the egos took a back seat. That's why this spec works, even though it has lost some of its simplicity along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But the magic continues, even if Mohsen and I find the spec difficult to follow. I gave the complexity to another brilliant man, Andre Radke, who works for me. He didn't like me for doing this to him, but Andre is a persistent man, and he got SOAP working in Frontier. Now I don't have to see the details. I just design systems and deploy them. And they work with systems written in Java and Python, and soon with those from Microsoft, and shortly from everyone else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="SOAP has Big Mo now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That's its (new) magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Tea-leave reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="Now we get to the wild speculation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="First, Microsoft didn't get to where they are by being stupid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But taken at face-value, there's something really stupid about broadcasting your five year product plan to your competitors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="They even named them, AOL, Sun, IBM, Oracle and Linux. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Without a doubt, the key strategists at these places must be poring over every detail they can get about Dot-Net. What are they concluding?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;We could beat them to market, by years.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now, remember, they're smart at Microsoft. Are they laying a trap? I think not. It's a chess game, but with a twist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;To get the government off our back,&quot; I imagine the Microsoft thinking goes, &quot;we have to have real competition.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I think Dot-Net shows the others how to do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Clutching the parachute&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;">
				<outline text="Earlier this month I wrote a story about how a baby eagle learns how to fly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/theBabyEagleStory &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It may sound like a bedtime story for kids, but it's not. It's a story for adults, powerful people who, if they reflect on the past, can realize that they know how to fly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="When we were in our 20s, with something to prove, we didn't need a parachute, we risked it all every day. In our 30s we established our place in the world. Now that we're in our mid-40s, something else is going on. Having accomplished so much in our 30s, it can be hard to put it all on the line, bet everything on the fairness of the universe. What we did so easily in our 20s, inverts itself in the 40s, now we want to hold on to what we got, and some of that is evident in Microsoft's strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's not totally a curveball for their competitors and the government. It reflects an understandable desire to turn the clock back and return to the moment of glory, when everything coalesced, when everyone looked to us for where we were going. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Yesterday I said to Atkinson, who I consider a personal friend, maybe when this is done we can retire and let the young folk take over, satisfied that we completed our jobs. I say the same to the management at Microsoft. We're out of the plane door. One hand is flying free but the other is holding on to the parachute. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If we want to have the kind of fun that's available to people who are pushing 50, it's time to make way for the next group of technologists, to pave the way for them, and step aside and let the universe work its magic. There are young people at Microsoft today who think the world is fair and fun and who have the desire to create a place for themselves. That's what we need to tap into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/4/00; 11:28:16 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I don't publish music">
				<outline text="I don't write music or perform it. I just use it. To me music is not about money, but I pay for it, as I pay for everything else I use that costs money. Almost everything seems to cost money. That's OK, I pay, and focus my attention on the art, on my experience."/>
				<outline text="As I'm writing this piece, I'm listening to an old favorite, &lt;a href=&quot;http://baez.woz.org/Lyrics/diamonds.html&quot;&gt;Diamonds and Rust&lt;/a&gt; by Joan Baez. I've paid for this song. I bought it on vinyl. I bought it on cassette. I bought it on CD. "/>
				<outline text="I am willing to buy it for play from my hard disk. I've been willing to do that for quite a few years. But the music industry has had its mind on piracy, not on legitimate use of the technology, the use by paying customers to listen to music with the point and click convenience that only the Internet can deliver."/>
				<outline text="Soon, I hear that Dell, a leading PC manufacturer will come out with a device that's as revolutionary as Napster, a low-power FM radio transmitter that plugs into my PC that will allow me to play the music through any FM receiver in my house. At that point, I can retire my now-obsolete CD players, most of which don't work very well, certainly not nearly as well as the system I have on my desktop."/>
				<outline text="As a software developer, I'm fascinated by the possibility of tools for writing and sharing nested and linked playlists, sequences of songs that branch. After every song, you could right-click, and choose one of a dozen different directions. Or just let it go, and let another fan build the mood for you, from his or her desktop, connected to your system over the Web. The technology to do this is here, today. "/>
				<outline text="I saw this clearly on Father's Day when I explored the the music written about fathers, performed by their (adult) children. It was a hugely emotional experience, it made me a happier person, because the music expresses something for me in a way that, as a user, I cannot. This is the gap I want to jump, and as a technologist, I know how to do it. "/>
				<outline text="I believe we're at the brink of a new form of listening to music, one which intimately involves fans in the music experience, and creates an environment that could unleash the kind of creative community that only happens when new technology explodes. With that will come new music, and new ways to play it, new ways to explore the emotions it brings up, and new kinds of community, deep ones, far deeper than those we've been able to create on the silent Web. This is one of the most exciting things going on, technologically and artistically, at the turn of the century."/>
				<outline text="So we've got musical artists, fans and technology, all that's in the way is the music industry. Even if they shut down Napster, so what? They still have to deal with the customers, the music and the technology. The Napster lawsuit is a distraction. A new artform awaits. New ways to use music. We'll pay money for it. But please, it's not about money."/>
				<outline text="The music industry is inflexible. We've learned about the kinds of deals they cut with the musicians, and as a paying user I'm sad to see that little if any of my money finds its way to the musicians. (If this isn't true, a thoughtful and public rebuttal is called-for from the music industry.)"/>
				<outline text="Further, let's not defend people's supposed right to pirate, but come on music industry, get over it, you can't protect the bits, you depend on the honesty of your users, as the rest of us who create digital software do."/>
				<outline text="These are many of the same issues we've already dealt with in the software business, and some we have never dealt with. What software has the integrity of music? How many software developers do you know by name? How corporate is software? Can you create software and get broad distribution and recognition for it without being somehow tethered to a huge aggressive corporation fighting for its life? How much has this attitude held back the software industry? How will the revolution in music change the software business?"/>
				<outline text="There will be more to say about this for sure. Through my Web writing I've become part of this discussion. Later this week I will participate in a televised discussion on CBS television. In August I will moderate a panel representing the music and Internet industry. "/>
				<outline text="I'm glad, as a user and a technologist to be able to help this industry find its way. Let's get beyond the sticky problem, let's make sure the creative people have the tools they need, and let's find new ways to tap the creativity of users. I'm sure there will be plenty of money to support the marketing and distribution of the music. Change is good. "/>

				<outline text="I came to Silicon Valley twenty-one years ago, to make software."/>
				<outline text="In the last few years, lots of new people came here to make money, and some of them did, selling air, in a worldwide pyramid scheme, a trance of unprecedented proportion, that is now in the process of collapsing."/>
				<outline text="Even mighty Yahoo is under pressure, much of their revenue coming from cash guzzling startups, buying flow for big bucks. Now that the cash is drying up, investors are wondering where Yahoo's revenue will come from. "/>
				<outline text="Technology has taken a backseat at technology companies. But not anymore. Now that the dot-com rage is dying, let's not forget that there's still a lot of work to do. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="P2P">
				<outline text="Even so, the Silicon Valley investment community is rushing head-on into a new rage called P2P, for Point-to-Point, that will wash out quicker than Push Technology, B2B, B2C and all the other stupid buzzwords that fed the pyramid schemes in the late 90s. "/>
				<outline text="The hype is not as important as functionality delivered to users' desktops. It's so irritating to watch the hypesters vie for headlines, as if that had anything to do with it. I think the investing public has a clue now, this plan will be rejected, but hopefully they won't conclude that the technology industry has no more work to do. Nothing could be further from the truth."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's the music, dummy">
				<outline text="The rage of Napster is not P2P, it's music! Get a clue."/>
				<outline text="If you want to be in P2P you'd better have good desktop tools, depth in protocols, and good content management, and a great server-side, and on and on."/>
				<outline text="And then remember, your job is to get the music to the ears in new interesting ways, and it must be easy. Ease of use is the hardest trick to pull off, the simple addition of desktop servers, an idea that I totally believe in btw, is a very small part of the puzzle. Don't focus on the path of communication. "/>
				<outline text="Focus on the user and music, sharing and persistent net connections. Napster is a great start, but it's only a start. Fanning out to serve other kinds of objects in a Napster-like way is a dead-end. Napster will beat you, they're already there."/>
				<outline text="Giving people easy tools that publish and link over persistent net connections is the next step, imho. Napster blew that door open. The technology industry was reluctant to go there. Looking for the next level of growth, we're not that timid any more. "/>
				<outline text="Look for service providers to change their user agreements, they must now universally allow servers to operate on home and business desktops."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="To the music industry">
				<outline text="And an aside to the music industry, which hopes to snuff out the user revolt by killing Napster, forget it. You're under water, the cat's out of the bag, you're closing the barn door after the (cash) cows left. You've already lost the battle. Along with the rest of us, you now have to struggle to make your business make sense in the new reality of the Internet. "/>
				<outline text="A great scene from the movie Beetlejuice. A football player says to the Director of Afterlife, &quot;Hey coach, I don't think we survived the crash.&quot; Right. "/>
				<outline text="Music industry, it's time for you to propose a plan for users of high integrity to get money into the hands of the artists, with you getting a small cut. The users renegotiated. You don't get to keep all the money anymore. I can't believe they're so blind they don't see this."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/10/00; 7:59:45 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Intro">
				<outline text="This piece serves two audiences, so it may not seem like a DaveNet piece, it might seem more like a column for XML Magazine, because that's what it is. "/>
				<outline text="I'm going to digress. XML is a new magazine published by Jim Fawcette and edited by Steve Gillmor. I knew Jim when he was an editor at InfoWorld in the early 80s. Now he's a media magnate, because he figured something out that no one else did, that there are a lot of Visual Basic programmers, and no one knew how to (or wanted to) make magazines and conferences for them. Jim did that, and it worked. Now he's branching out and showing up in lots of powerful places. Now he starts new magazines and I write for him. I find that very interesting."/>
				<outline text="Steve Gillmor, who promises not to edit me, is an interesting character too. He's Dan Gillmor's older brother. Talking with Steve I can hear Dan's accent in his voice. I said &quot;Steve, you sound like Dan!&quot; A bit of a groan. Ooops. I understand, I have a younger brother too. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, to the XML Magazine readers, my name is Dave Winer. I run a Web tools and publishing company called UserLand. We make a publishing platform called Frontier, and an easy-to-use browser based Web application for editing sites called Manila. The software runs on Windows and Mac, Unix coming soon. Our goal is to turn the Web into a great group writing environment; we actually believe we've already done that. "/>
				<outline text="I've been a software developer for 25 years. I did stuff for Unix, CP/M, the Apple II, IBM PC, Mac and Windows. I've written outliners, an object database, script interpreter, development tools, a content framework, and now HTTP servers and clients. I am also a writer, having been a columnist at Wired, and have written for the Web since 1994. "/>
				<outline text="I co-designed SOAP, which is the protocol underneath the Microsoft Dot-Net platform. I like working with Microsoft. We also work with Mac and Windows developers and members of the open source community, but not the zealots, and only people with open minds. Now I'm going to tell you why I like XML."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why I like XML">
				<outline text="I like XML because I like choice, not just for me, but for people who use my software."/>
				<outline text="I like choice because that means I can sell products and services without worrying about being crushed by a platform vendor. I like developing for the Internet, which I think of as the platform without a platform vendor. In other words there's no one who can crush me here. That's good!"/>
				<outline text="Now, for the last six to eight years, developing for the Internet meant developing for the Web. You'd write server applications that run on any operating system that can host HTTP applications, which is basically every operating system. Users of your applications could use any operating system that had a Microsoft or Netscape browser (the two browsers supported by most Web apps) which, again, is most operating systems. "/>
				<outline text="This was great because it meant there was no such thing as Windows or Mac or Unix software, there was just Web software. But like any apparent panacea, it wasn't so great, because the applications had limited user interfaces. There were attempts to fix this by adding Java and DHTML to the browser, but it always came up way short of the user interface techniques that we already knew."/>
				<outline text="It was a puzzle. Why do I like the Web so much when it's so funky? I spent five years figuring that out. In 1996 I learned that the Web is groupware. Real-world websites are collaborations of designers, writers, programmers, graphics people, and users. Anything short of groupware is going to come up short. "/>
				<outline text="Then we spent two years porting our publishing software to Windows. I hate porting, it's a waste of time, but our home platform, the Macintosh, was in constant confusion, and the people we wanted to reach were using Windows, in droves. So we ported. "/>
				<outline text="Some time in 1998 I decided to start editing my home page, then other parts of my website, in a Web browser. It was fantastic! Before that I had used a check-out-check-in system, the same kind of software that programmers use to manage application development as groupware. "/>
				<outline text="Making the switch to editing in the browser had one huge benefit. I no longer had two locations for my writing. When I noticed a mistake on my site, I clicked the Edit This Page button, made the change, clicked another button and the change was made. I didn't have to memorize two locations for the content, one for reading and one for writing. And there were no mistake-prone 18-step processes for updating the site. Three steps is all it takes, and that's nirvana for a Web writer."/>
				<outline text="(And even better, I didn't have to bother a grouchy site administrator. I could do all the editing myself.)"/>
				<outline text="Now here's something even weirder. Writing in a Web browser is wonderful but it also sucks. In other words, the Web browser is the best place to edit copy for the Web, but it's also the worst. Why? Because the editing tools in the browser are the worst. No Find-and-Replace or Undo, none of the elegance of the great desktop writing tools of the Mac and Windows. "/>
				<outline text="So how could I get the best of both worlds, a great writing tool with integrated networking? Believe it or not, that's what lead me to XML."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="XML over HTTP">
				<outline text="We were already working on ways to connect servers using a protocol called SOAP, which we designed with Microsoft and Developmentor starting in Spring 1998, but we hadn't thought of using SOAP to connect writing tools to servers until the summer of 1999. "/>
				<outline text="The reasoning went like this. What makes the browser such a great network editing tool? Answer -- it understands HTTP at its core. What if we made a desktop writing tool that understands HTTP at its core? What would that look like? How would it work?"/>
				<outline text="Here's what we came up with. In the browser, right under the Edit This Page button, is another, smaller button that says PIKE, which is the name of our desktop editor. Click on the button and the server sends the contents of the story to the editor. It opens in a window. The editor comes to the front. You edit, the normal way, using all its wizzyness, drag and drop, expand and collapse, reorganization and annotation, all the things no Web browser is ever going to do (at least not in our lifetimes). "/>
				<outline text="But what do you do when you want to update the copy on the server? How complicated should that be? Well, luckily your braincells are already programmed to know how to do this. Pull down the File menu and choose Save. That's it. As with the browser-based editor, we worked, even hacked, at simplicity. We don't think it can get much simpler than this, and simplicity is the single biggest thing that's in the way of the Web as an easy writing environment."/>
				<outline text="Now what does this have to do with XML over HTTP and SOAP? Well, that's how it works. That's how the workstation application and the server are connected. So in this context, XML is simply enabling technology, but it's worth lifting the hood, because the way it enables is very different, because it is open."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="XML can be open">
				<outline text="The articles in the rest of this magazine, which I have not seen, probably make XML seem very complicated. But it is not complicated. You can ignore most of what they tell you about schemas and namespaces and parsers and whatever. It's meaningless. If it ever gets widely deployed, the details will be hidden behind middleware interfaces, because basically it is only comprehensible to a very small number of people who care. "/>
				<outline text="The important thing about XML is that it means that your software can be replaced. Now this may not sound like an advantage, unless you work for a software vendor who's being sued for antitrust, but it actually is an advantage for everyone. Because users have choice, there are fewer reasons for them to wait. And we can have diversity. Not only will there be desktop editing tools for Windows, but there will be equivalent tools for people who use Macs. Maybe someday Unix will be a great writing platform, or maybe something revolutionary and wonderful will come along that no one has ever heard of that you'll want to use to edit your Web site. In the software business you never can tell what's coming next, and with open interfaces the new things can easily be compatible with the old."/>
				<outline text="Further, no company or individual, no matter how mighty they are, can do everything well. Some make great servers, others make great editors. And there are all kinds of editors, from page layout programs, graphics editors, flowcharters, outliners, spreadsheets, presenters, and on and on. People should be able to use any kind of tool to edit content for the Web, even things we haven't thought of yet, and they should automatically plug in. Again, open interfaces make that possible."/>
				<outline text="The beauty of XML is that it's *possible* to make open interfaces with it. It's not automatic or inevitable, so you should ask your vendors if they are working with their competitors on plug-compatibility. Make it an issue when you decide which tools to use. Because if you have choice, you can never be left behind. "/>

			<outline text="Start a farm system">
				<outline text="Yesterday the Wall Street Journal ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/430894.asp?0nm=-12O&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;Webzines merge to survive shakeout&quot;. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;Feed Magazine and Suck.com, two of the Web's oldest publications, are expected to announce Monday that they are joining forces.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="I've been expecting this kind of deal for quite some time, and have been preparing for the day that the euphoria died and the publications of the Web would start re-thinking their business models. "/>
				<outline text="Here's my thinking. Any webzine can grow right now by offering sites to their users with their branding on it. Start a farm system, publish the work of amateurs. "/>
				<outline text="Teach them how to write for the public. A year from now, turn the best of them into pros, and the year after, and the year after that. "/>
				<outline text="The business model? Users openly design new products. Manufacturers make the most exciting products and sell them to the users. We go back to making products that people want. Step one is to give the users a platform. That's where the publications come in. (They also get a cut of the sales.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's not a mirror">
				<outline text="The Web is not a mirror of the print industry, that's why advertising is not so important. The unique thing about the Web is that it's interactive. The challenge is to squeeze quality, high-integrity writing out of the readers, and present it back to them with a seal of quality. That's a much higher-growth proposition than employing writers and running ads as the print industry does."/>
				<outline text="I was disappointed to see that Automatic Media is using SlashDot-style conferencing for the Suck-Feed combination. I strongly believe this is the wrong approach. Better to start new Sucks and Feeds using the traditions of sarcasm and literacy that each of these pubs have done such a great job of starting."/>
				<outline text="UserLand is doing it that way. We've started over 6000 Scripting News-type sites here in the last six months. Some are now reaching critical mass. It's a thing to behold. "/>
				<outline text="On SlashDot they had to add hard-to-use filtering to create a minimal level of quality. In our world, it's the other way around -- how do you find the good new stuff? That creates the incentive for thoughtful content. That's why, along with Manila, we made the investment in syndication, and in weblogs.com, to assist in finding new stuff."/>
				<outline text="Some pubs could apply this model right now, ones that have powerful readerships, many of whom could immediately start their own sub-pubs. The Industry Standard, Salon, Red Herring, Wired, Suck, Feed, MacInTouch, Fawcette, come to mind, but there are probably dozens that could grow this way. Some are already doing it. SourceForge, Motley Fool, Gomez."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Salon">
				<outline text="Of all the publications mentioned above, the one that interests me most is Salon."/>
				<outline text="Here's the pitch. They're independent, not tethered to a larger organization. Their voice has unimpeachable integrity."/>
				<outline text="Salon best captures the early spirit of the Web, and has grown with the Web, not remained static. Wired, which was the early leader, has been decimated, half going to Lycos and the other half going to Conde Nast; and even worse, the people of the early Wired are dispersed all over the industry."/>
				<outline text="Salon has a highly regarded name, not just in the Internet space, but more broadly."/>
				<outline text="They ran the Courtney Love piece. It made sense for it to run there (except I wish they hadn't split it over four pages, there's that pesky print advertising model). That it made sense is the important thing. That's why it would also make sense for Courtney Love and others like her to have their own permanent space on Salon."/>
				<outline text="Another reason I like Salon is that they're &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=SALN&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;cheap&lt;/a&gt;. The market cap, at market close on Tuesday, is only $16 million. Totally undervalued. "/>

			<outline text="The Byrds">
				<outline text="Yesterday I watched the Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, on C-SPAN, of people on all sides of the controversy about Napster and music on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="I was surprised to learn how far another innovator, MP3.Com, had bent to accomodate the music industry, by providing a way for people who had legally purchased CDs to gain immediate access to the music over the Web. The CEO of MP3.Com, Michael Robertson, gave a compelling demo, and was backed by the testimony of Roger McGuinn, founder of the Byrds, a popular band of the 1960s."/>
				<outline text="From there, I went to McGuinn's MP3.Com &lt;a href=&quot;http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/11/roger_mcguinn.html&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, found his email address, rm\@mcguinn.com, sent him a message, and got a response. "/>
				<outline text="It's important to understand the music business from the artist's point of view. We've heard from the industry, and there are plenty of vocal fans, here's one of the founders of rock and roll, Roger McGuinn."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Roger McGuinn on MP3.Com">
				<outline text="Hello, my name is Roger McGuinn. My experience in the music business began in 1960 with my recording of &quot;Tonight In Person&quot; on RCA Records. I played guitar and banjo for the folk group the &quot;Limeliters.&quot; I subsequently recorded two albums with the folk group, the &quot;Chad Mitchell Trio.&quot; I toured and recorded with Bobby Darin and was musical director of Judy Collins' third album. In each of those situations I was not a royalty artist, but a musician for hire. "/>
				<outline text="My first position as a royalty artist came in 1964 when I signed a recording contract with Columbia Records as the leader of the folk-rock band the &quot;Byrds.&quot; During my tenure with the Byrds I recorded over fifteen albums. In most cases a modest advance against royalties was all the money I received for my participation in these recording projects."/>
				<outline text="In 1973 my work with the Byrds ended. I embarked on a solo recording career on Columbia Records, and recorded five albums. The only money I've received for these albums was the modest advance paid prior to each recording. "/>
				<outline text="In 1977 I recorded three albums for Capitol Records in the group &quot;McGuinn Clark and Hillman.&quot; Even though my song &quot;Don't You Write Her Off&quot; was a top 40 hit, the only money I received from Capitol Records was in the form of a modest advance."/>
				<outline text="In 1989 I recorded a solo CD, &quot;Back From Rio&quot;, for Arista Records. This CD sold approximately 500,000 copies world wide, and aside from a modest advance, I have received no royalties from that project. "/>
				<outline text="The same is true of my 1996 recording of &quot;Live From Mars&quot; for Hollywood Records. In all cases the publicity generated by having recordings available and promoted on radio, created an audience for my live performances. My performing work is how I make my living. Even though I've recorded over twenty-five records, I cannot support my family on record royalties alone."/>
				<outline text="In 1994 I began making recordings of traditional folk songs that I'd learned as a young folk singer. I was concerned that these wonderful songs would be lost. The commercial music business hasn't promoted traditional music for many years. These recordings were all available for free download on my web site http://mcguinn.com/ on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="In 1998 an employee of MP3.com heard the folk recordings and invited me to place them on MP3.com. They offered an unheard of, nonexclusive recording contract, with a royalty rate of 50% of the gross sales. I was delighted by this youthful and uncommonly fair approach to the recording industry. MP3.com not only allowed me to place these songs on their server, but also offered to make CDs of these songs for sale. They absorbed all the packaging and distribution costs. Not only is MP3.com an on-line record distributor, it is also becoming the new radio of the 21st Century!"/>
				<outline text="So far I have made thousands of dollars from the sale of these folk recordings on MP3.com, and feel privileged to be able to use MP3s and the Internet as a vehicle for my artistic expression. MP3.com has offered me more artistic freedom than any of my previous relationships with mainstream recording companies. I think this avenue of digital music delivery is of great value to young artists, because it's so difficult for bands to acquire a recording contract. When young bands ask me how to get their music heard, I always recommend MP3.com."/>

				<outline text="I still have a backlog of good stuff. And to make matters even worse other people are writing beautiful essays about music and the Web, and the shifting of money and power in the dot-com world; even XML is blooming now. "/>
				<outline text="It's a time of creative explosion, something to let rush through, in the next quiet period, if that ever comes, we can figure out why. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Doc, Lawrence.. Tom">
				<outline text="Tom Matrullo, tmatrullo\@comcastpc.com, is Managing Editor of regional news sites in Florida. Doc Searls runs a weblog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;doc.weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;, as does Lawrence Lee, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomalak.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;tomalak.weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. "/>
				<outline text="Lawrence is a Web researcher. Ask him a question, within fifteen minutes you get an analysis, with links, and an angle. Doc is a publicist, editor, pundit and Cluetrain author. His weblog has great personal writing, and links to things he cares about."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday Lawrence pointed to a piece on Doc's site, written by Tom Matrullo, which is a total heart-grabber and idea-inspirer, on the subject of Napster and music and history, art, and excitement. I immediately wanted to get his ideas in front of as many people as possible The distributed editorial system I described yesterday is working its magic. Here's what Tom said."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Tom Matrullo on Napster">
				<outline text="Mozart once heard a piece of music so piercingly beautiful that he was moved to write it down from memory after hearing it performed in a church. He had no choice. The church believed it &quot;owned&quot; the music, and forbade anyone to copy it. So, Mozart pulled a Napster. The piece has been in the public domain ever since, for all to enjoy."/>
				<outline text="Napster -- a simple tool, crafted with no unnecessary arabesques of code -- is organic software: Dionysus who knows no boundaries. Such a natural tool seems obvious in hindsight, like an evolutionary &quot;Eureka!&quot; -- the moment when life figured out the heart."/>
				<outline text="Why wasn't Napster obvious before it stared us in the face?"/>
				<outline text="Open Napster and you're looking out over dizzying vistas of other people's music (OPM) on Other People's Hard Drives (OPHDs). It's like suddenly gaining several thousand generous, musically literate friends. You have highly compressed conversations sharing intimate knowledge of the music you love, without ums, uhs and other inessential articulations."/>
				<outline text="In a commercial culture, this tool was nearly unable to be thought. But here it is, offering me Sara Brightman in full-throated ease, thanks to some angel named SWAT18."/>
				<outline text="Napster has been called the third quantum jump in software, after VisiCalc and Mosaic. Not because of any technical complexity. Its designer, Shawn Fanning, bought a book to figure out how to write the program. The coding wasn't hard to do. The concept was hard to think."/>
				<outline text="If the Cluetrain Manifesto turns notions of markets upside down, Napster turns the trucking template inside out. Napster enables the nonce deployment of love via self-organizing labyrinths that defy central distribution models. Like the Manifesto's position that &quot;Markets are conversations,&quot; Napster gives us a place for people's music to be held in common, not consumed."/>
				<outline text="Music has always had underground modes of dissemination. Remember how every working musician had their cheap xeroxed &quot;fake books&quot;? Napster was difficult to conceive because we forgot sharing. Central distribution of intellectual property (IntelProp) via channels, trucks, ships, presses, wires and microwaves -- &quot;trucking&quot; for short -- was all we could remember. In that system, music is not what gladdens our souls. It is mediated Product inserted into dead bodies, shipped and sold for good hard cash."/>
				<outline text="We used to need the corpses -- CDs, vinyl, tape, etc. We, the sorryassed multitudes who couldn't get to the Met, to La Scala, or to Ozzfest, to bask in the unmediated presence of the Voice, the Artist. IntelProp vampires fed on our failure to arrive at the live act. Trucking is the wounding prosthetic that grows inside our disability to be present, as advertising infects us with discontent on which it dines."/>
				<outline text="And this spawned Content. Corporate distributors only see numbers, units, penetration, market share. To understand Content, you must ignore it. Pay attention only to containers."/>
				<outline text="If you imagine there is something called Content, you won't like Napster."/>
				<outline text="Courtney Love nailed it: &quot;What the hell is content? Nobody buys content. Real people pay money for music because it means something to them. Being a 'content provider' is prostitution work that devalues our art and doesn't satisfy our spirits. Artistic expression has to be provocative. The problem with artists and the Internet: Once their art is reduced to content, they may never have the opportunity to retrieve their souls.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Napster doesn't distribute Content. Instead, it offers a voyeuristic look into OPM on OPHDs- a glimpse into the intimate specificity of other people's loves. More than a look -- we have permission to &quot;take&quot; what we like, secure in the knowledge we are welcome to it. A regular Dionysian orgy of passions."/>
				<outline text="Other people's loves: Downloaded music is like the commonplace books of old, in which people would preserve snippets from books that held special meaning for them. Napster feels more personal than &quot;personalized&quot; sites. Without leering, it offers constellations of love affairs people have had with music- each one different, each reflecting a soul."/>
				<outline text="Napster is ingenuity powered by enthusiasm and generosity of spirit. It is the negative image of those porn sites that promise you'll be nuzzling 417,000 nubile young women within 30 seconds of handing over your credit card."/>
				<outline text="Interestingly, it is also the negative image of the piratical record company model described in detail by Love -- how did porn sites and record companies get into the same slimy category? Hmmmm."/>
				<outline text="Sons of Napster will add features to its basic model -- links to all kinds of info about music one is downloading, about the artists, where they're appearing, etc. And a means of stopping a download and restarting without having to start over. Or, a way of finding out if the only guy with the song you've needed for years is going to log off in the middle of your download. So what? Napster gives so much that any quibble is downright mean-spirited."/>
				<outline text="We can already hear the coming fuss, when bandwidth and grandsons of Napster permit us to exchange our passions for videos, films and other IntelProp."/>
				<outline text="Some good things will never be transferred this way. Like cuttings from flowering plants. Too bad, because I'm sure gardeners love to share their cuttings exactly as music lovers enjoy sharing their cuts."/>
				<outline text="The analogy isn't all that lousy, really. The gardener buys seeds, or borrows a cutting, and grows a plant -- the plant makes possible its own replication, but only in real life, not virtually. The point is, the gardener who owns something he/she wants to share will always make a cutting. The cutting gives away part of the whole to create a new whole."/>
				<outline text="With Napster, we are made more whole: Music sings without trucks, dances without dead limbs."/>
				<outline text="The act of downloading a song is labor, sort of. A broadband declension of the medieval passion of monks for manuscripts. When I play a song I've downloaded, I experience every note more intimately for having had a hand in its replication."/>
				<outline text="Napster brings closer a paradisiacal economy -- a realm of abundance where trucking (and advertising) is hard to imagine. Where Mozart doesn't have to kidnap music. That is why it is embattled. "/>
				<outline text="When musicians work, they need to be compensated. They can either become one with the vampires, or look to salaries or tips -- patrons or fans. That way requires faith, if songs are to be free."/>

			<outline text="Progress">
				<outline text="Much progress to report in music on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="First and most important, another artist has made a statement about the music industry, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/&quot;&gt;Courtney Love&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/11/roger_mcguinn.html&quot;&gt;Roger McGuinn&lt;/a&gt; did. "/>
				<outline text="The artist is Matt Johnson of TheThe. He tells a similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethe.com/toc.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;, with Courtney-like passion. He wants to make music, connect with his fans, and make a decent living doing it."/>
				<outline text="He says that the music industry is consolidating around acts with huge followings, marching through them, and leaving behind musicians with devoted audiences in the hundreds of thousands, with no distribution or marketing, or money to create new music."/>
				<outline text="Lives are being wasted, some of the most creative people of our time. "/>
				<outline text="Luckily the means are here to create and organize communities around the artists, and to flow money from the fans to the artists, and for them to flow their creativity back."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="NY Times op-ed">
				<outline text="In today's NY Times, another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/00/07/15/oped/15shir.html&quot;&gt;anthem&lt;/a&gt;, by Clay Shirky of Feed, where he explains the user experience of music on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="There's a search engine now, and you can browse other people's music collections. This leads down old trails, and new ones. Now you can find fifteen versions of a song, by artists you forgot and ones you've never heard of. You can surf through music as you surf through the Web."/>
				<outline text="It seems such a small thing to make money flow through this too."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Proposal">
				<outline text="Here's a no-nonsense proposal that's in synch with the feeling (I believe) of many Napster users. "/>
				<outline text="I want to subscribe to music, to get a monthly bill, like my cable bill, but I want everything, and I want them to trust me, I want files on my hard disk, nothing less."/>
				<outline text="$30 per month. And a very low fee for college students. Everyone should be happy about this. And the artists get 50 percent of the gross, distributed according to how much play their music gets. The more popular it is, the more they get."/>
				<outline text="Further, it's OK if they ship low-resolution scans of the music, to give users an incentive to purchase CDs, and to keep downloads smaller."/>
				<outline text="BTW, one of the surprises of Napster is that music is a business application, esp for people who are professional thinkers (knowledge workers), such as engineers, attorneys, researchers. A whole new market for the music industry to learn about. (Businesses generally pay, even if consumers don't always.)"/>
				<outline text="Another BTW, Gene Kan, one of the Gnutella authors, is promoting a tiered royalty system, where fans make a bit of money if you download the music from their Internet site. It's a good idea, but it comes up a few steps after the current mess is cleaned up."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="July 26">
				<outline text="There's a showdown on July 26 in US District Court court in SF, between Napster and the RIAA."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday I spoke with my attorney, and 20-year friend, Jack Russo, who has tried copyright cases in front of the judge in the Napster case, Marilyn Patel. "/>
				<outline text="Jack is sure she will shut them down later this month. If that happens, it will be the beginning of a multi-step legal fight that will probably also involve the US Congress and the President."/>
				<outline text="Watching the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Utah Senator Orren Hatch urged the music industry to quickly arrive at a price for licensing music via the Internet, or have one imposed on them by legislation. "/>
				<outline text="I'm no lawyer, but I think legislation trumps the court. (Unless the law is unconstitutional.)"/>
				<outline text="And it was refreshing to hear our elected reprentatives respect the voting power of the 20 million Napster users. For once Internet users are being taken seriously."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's a mess">
				<outline text="A couple of years ago it was controversial to put lyrics on the Web, but now, with the line drawn at the music itself, no one is paying attention to the lyrics. Today, through a search engine like Google, you can find all the lyrics to all the music. "/>
				<outline text="But it's even messier than that. AOL operates a search engine that indexes MP3 files on the Web. If you search for an artist, it returns links to all their songs. Click on the link, listen to the music. You can save the MP3 file to a folder on your hard disk, or copy it to a special Walkman-like device designed to play MP3s (this will be a multi-billion dollar market, surely)."/>
				<outline text="That AOL is doing this tells you how messy the situation is. Through the RIAA, which AOL is a member of, they are suing Napster for doing the same thing. There is no functional difference between Napster and the search engine that AOL operates. Each of them finds music that you can download, without royalty or permission of the artist or the publishing company."/>
				<outline text="I used the AOL system yesterday to download Joan Osborne songs, some of my favorites, ones that I haven't listened to in quite some time. I also searched for Metallica, found plenty of music, but didn't listen to any of it."/>
				<outline text="Napster's attorneys, take note. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It is a revolution">
				<outline text="I know some people don't believe in revolutions, but this is one."/>
				<outline text="We were training for the last six years, with the silent Web, learning how to browse, how to write, and how to run high volume servers. "/>
				<outline text="As Gil Scott-Heron sang in the 1960s, the revolution will not be televised. This medium belongs to the artists and the users, not the middlemen. It should have always been that way, except for distribution problems. This is the first medium that does not require much in the way of middlemen. The potential for new, relevant, even customized, art is greater. We don't all have to listen to the same music. And more people can work as entertainers, perhaps even ordinary people like you and me."/>
				<outline text="The artists will make more money, and there will be money for middlemen, but the system will go through a reformation. Even if they shut down Napster, there are all those disks with all those songs on them. They'll get reconnected, probably within hours of the shutdown."/>
				<outline text="And coming in the next year, there will be a huge explosion in portable devices for playing all those MP3 files. Vast fortunes will be made, and few if any of the products have even been designed yet. An economic and cultural boom, happening at the same time."/>
				<outline text="Now, when music, with its personal and emotional values can come freely through the Internet, that changes the kind of writing people are expecting through email and the Web. My writing has always seemed a little odd to some people. &quot;He's writing about himself!&quot; people complain. As if you could write about anything without writing about yourself."/>
				<outline text="But music is so much more personal. I love trawling through directories of other people's music. Although primitive, it is a form of expression, a more personal one than a Web page, and it's new. I've never done anything like this. I have no idea where it leads. That's why it's so exciting."/>

				<outline text="We hope to get linked in where music, fans and artists gather. I'll keep you posted on how it goes, of course."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Woz">
				<outline text="Last night I emailed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woz.org/&quot;&gt;Steve Wozniak&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneer of digital technology, educator, supporter and investor in music, and an active Web developer. "/>
				<outline text="He said: &quot;After reading one of your DaveNets I emailed Roger McGuinn with supporting comments and  he's offered to come visit and help with my class, where I'm engaging 8th graders in skeptical inquiries into the whole topic.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="He continued: &quot;I have worries about the new not turning out better than the old.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Me too. &quot;I imagine that many of the artists must be terrified of what's happening now. It seems we're a junction when some love could ease a lot of fear. Your smiling face and good nature could make a big difference.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Steve and I are going to meet later this month, and in early August we're going to Shoreline, where he has a box, to hear BB King and Sting. (I'll bring my camera of course.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Nothing but voids">
				<outline text="This website hopes to fill a time-honored role in the technology world, a publication that stands behind (and beside) a creative platform that's booming. Our interest is clear, we support music on the Internet, much as PC Magazine supported IBM users in the early 80s; and MacWorld was instrumental to the success of the Macintosh. Both pubs provided a common place where users and developers could meet, explore new ideas, and sell their wares."/>
				<outline text="With music added to the technology mix, now there are also artists. They put their whole selves into their work, and in doing so, become personally vulnerable, more so than any software developer has. This adds a new dimension to our work, one that's often overlooked in the technology industry, the human issues of a platform. We will explore that in our new publication."/>
				<outline text="The mingling of artists and technologists will also revolutionize the technology industry. There are so many parallels. We will see products in a new light, as the creative work of human beings, not the blustery proclamations of billionaire icons. All our focus has been on the power of money and distribution, as it has in the music business. Now let's focus on people. People make and use software, the same way people make and use music. It really is that simple. We'll route around the middlemen in software. We have so much to learn from each other; there's so much previously untapped power exposed in the new medium. Let's nurture that power, not snuff it out, as some want to. Never has the contrast between art and fear been more clear, at least not in my lifetime."/>

				<outline text="DJ Dave here, spinning em up. Listening to the Kinks. &quot;Come dancing, all her boyfriends used to come and call, why not come dancing, it's only nat-u-ral.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="The music industry waited too long. Looking for someone to blame. The courts so far have gone along, but you can still get all the music you want for free on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="This week Microsoft is working with EMI on a complicated scheme to get paid-for music on people's hard drives. A year ago, this would have been a revolution, Internet users everywhere would have hailed Microsoft for bringing the music industry into the new world, but now it's too little too late."/>
				<outline text="Do I feel sorry for the music industry? No. We've *all* been watching the value of our intellectual property shift and rotate. When the consumer software industry was nascent, we went through the copy protection fight with users, and as always, the users won. The Internet is the continuation of that. The old economics are old, there's a new formula, people still (not everyone) want to pay for what they use. The music industry could have helped restore value to intellectual property in other artforms. Instead they injected huge doses of fear, and have polarized users. (The $multi-billion proposed settlement with MP3.Com scares the daylights out of me.)"/>
				<outline text="Until recently, music was immune, the pipes were too small, the fans too scared, to move music over the Internet. No one wanted to go first. Then the dam broke. The music industry doesn't say anything to the fans, other than calling them pirates, focusing the discussion on money and ignoring the art that's being created."/>
				<outline text="As a user, my challenge is to figure out what to say to the musicians, to invite them to come participate in the new artistic playground. As I said yesterday, they must be scared. We must talk with them, answer their questions, and make it clear that no one is doing this, it's just happening. "/>
				<outline text="Remember when you were younger and hungry. When change was good. Be there again. Be hungry for the artistic challenge, participate in the creation of a new medium. It can be a happy thing! Say something, we'll listen, and tell you what we hear. We're waiting, waiting, to hear from you."/>
				<outline text="Listen to David Bowie: &quot;Every time I thought I'd got it made, it seemed the taste was not so sweet.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Or Leon Russell: &quot;Listen to the sea roll in, thinking of you, and how it might have been.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="It's impossible to come up with representative soundbites of these stories, because the stories are filled with them. The basic theme is that the people of the music industry, some on the record, are saying publicly that things have changed, the initiatives are too little too late, the music industry plans are Hail Mary plays. Read these pieces to see the resolve of the music industry, crumbling."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Withdraw the lawsuits">
				<outline text="I urge the music industry to withdraw the Napster and MP3.Com lawsuits. "/>
				<outline text="Shutting down these companies will do nothing to stem the tide, and they alienate you from the music fans, whose patience must be wearing thin."/>
				<outline text="As the EMI exec in the LA Times piece did, sit down with your son or daughter, or a friend who uses Napster, and start grooving on the tunes. Enjoy music as you never have. Then think."/>
				<outline text="A lot of music industry execs say they got into music because they love it. Taken at face value, I urge you to love it again. Share the experience. You'll find lots of new business models. As Jimmy Iovine says in the LA Times piece, you have to get it right, quickly. We'll work with you, but first, take the hex off the companies who are helping to facilitate the revolution. (That's all they're doing.)"/>

				<outline text="Think of this as a Web scrapbook of the evolution of music culture on the Internet. The articles are in reverse-chronologic order, ie the most recent pieces appear first.

				<outline text="Another moment of serendipity. Looking for &quot;Where did the love go?&quot; by Roberta Flack, I found &quot;Where did our love go?&quot; by the Supremes. Never heard of it. Double-click. Wow, it's an old favorite, a song I listened to in the 60s. Great stuff. &quot;Baby baby ooh baby baby.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="A couple of weeks ago, clicking on David Bowie songs, I must have also decided to download his Little Drummer Boy duet with Bing Crosby. I'm listening to it in the middle of summer in California, far away from the time of this piece. &quot;It's a pretty thing,&quot; Bing says. So true!"/>
				<outline text="The moment is made more poignant, learning that Crosby died a month after doing the song in 1977. Steven Lewis, a college biology instructor in Pennsylvania says &quot;Some viewed the joint performance of Bing and Bowie as a symbol of the end of the inter-generational wars of the 1960s and 1970s.&quot; "/>

			<outline text="Do you know Stephen King?">
				<outline text="If you know Stephen King, could you forward him this email? I'd like to get a message to him."/>
				<outline text="First a little background. Today there was an Associated Press story about King's latest book, The Plant. It's being published a chapter at a time on the Web, pay as you go, $1 per installation, on the honor system. He's taking a chance on the first two installments, if there isn't enough money from those, there won't be a third or fourth."/>
				<outline text="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20000724/tc/stephen_king_internet_3.html "/>
				<outline text="After reading the AP story, and linking to it on my news site, www.scripting.com, I commented &quot;It almost goes without saying that I like this a lot. It's a route-around of the first order. Nuke the middlemen, like this one..&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Then I pointed to a Wired interview with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. It's no secret, I think Bezos and others are getting away with the rape of the Internet through patents. Other developers, creative people not that different from King, feel the same way. "/>
				<outline text="Asked why he sues competitors Bezos says &quot;Patents are not intended for defensive purposes only. The intent of the system is to give innovators a window to recoup their research and development costs, 20 years from the date of filing or 17 years from the date of issue, whichever is longer.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Then I went back to the King site, to buy the first two installments, and holy guacamole, he wants me to give the money to Amazon! You can check it out for yourself."/>
				<outline text="http://www.stephenking.com/download.html"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Steal from the best">
				<outline text="So here's what I want to say to Stephen King."/>
				<outline text="Mr. King, I've read every one of your books, paid for them of course, and I would happily buy this one, especially because it could help the Internet. But it's a shame that that you took this risk on behalf of the Internet (what if it fails?) and didn't check out who you're partnering with. I can't give money to Amazon and keep a clear conscience. I want you to understand why, because I think, as an avid reader of your books, that you would care if you knew."/>
				<outline text="I'm a commercial software developer and a writer. I enjoy the privilege of free speech in my writing that I don't enjoy in my software. If Bezos has a patent on something that I need to make my software work, I'm out of luck. He owns the idea. Until recently this was *not* the way it worked in software, but the US Patent and Trademark Office started issuing patents covering very basic ideas that take little or no R&amp;D, they're so obvious.  "/>
				<outline text="The Internet which you and I use was built out of an open sharing of ideas. By erecting barriers, as Amazon has, and being aggressive about it, they are milking a cash cow they didn't create."/>
				<outline text="To put it in analogous terms for writers, imagine if you couldn't write a story because Dean Koontz had already written it. What if the idea were as basic as Boy Meets Girl? That's what's going on in another creative space, software."/>
				<outline text="Writers have a better ethic, only steal from the best. We want the same ethic in software, we used to have it. Now our art is becoming the province of lawyers and profiteers like Bezos. "/>
				<outline text="Bezos is especially horrific because he uses his patents as a competitive weapon. The invasion of a new kind of monster. Driven by greed, he destroys the best hope of freedom for mankind. Naive author walks into a hornet's nest. Does he tell the true story?"/>

As the morning goes on, I like to listen to black male vocalists. Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield, Jimmy Cliff, BB King, Gil Scott-Heron. They mostly aren't singing about love (or maybe it's love of self). It's still great stuff."/>
				<outline text="I'm listening to BB King sing The Thrill is Gone. &quot;Now that it's over, all I can do is wish you well.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Now I know that even if the judge shuts down Napster later today, there are other services up and running that do the same thing. Even so, I'll be singing the blues with BB, because we have to keep fighting, when what I want to do is make love. But before the thrill ends (it still might not), I want to remember to thank the people who deserve it."/>
				<outline text="First, I'd like to thank Shawn Fanning, Hank Barry, Eddie Kessler and the people at Napster and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humwin.com/team.html&quot;&gt;Hummer-Winblad&lt;/a&gt;, for having the courage to challenge the music industry. "/>
				<outline text="I know the music industry believes that we're a band of pirates, but I know otherwise. Read on."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The thrill *was* gone">
				<outline text="Music, like most popular culture was caught in a boring malaise, without color, programmed to get us to listen to commercials, while we believed this was music. Read back issues of DaveNet for proof, I stopped listening to music. My CD collection bored me, and when I visited the record store I'd often come back with nothing. I didn't know how to parse the racks. The CDs cost so much money, and nothing excited me. Sometimes I'd come back from the store to find that I had bought a CD I already had! That did me no good at all."/>
				<outline text="Now it's very different. I've written about some of the serendipity, with a search engine and human guides, I've rediscovered old favorites, I've learned new bands. Multiple versions of songs by artists I've never heard of. I get to be my own DJ, I don't have to listen to today's top bands, which don't speak to or for me. I listen to what I want to listen to. What a thrill."/>
				<outline text="And millions of other people are doing it. We have supermarket conversations about music now. The music industry execs should get out there and listen. Music is exciting again! Any marketer worth his reputation should be able to make a lot of money now. But they're stuck, they can't get past their rage at the loss of control. These people must love to control us. Maybe that's where they get *their* thrill. It can't be about money, not really, because they can have lots of money. They can practically print money if they just listen. "/>
				<outline text="Bottom-line: I simply can't find the music I want in record stores. With Napster I am no longer limited. Music is fantastic again. I am thrilled!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No one's here">
				<outline text="People who don't know this medium, who we've been hearing a lot from recently, make the mistake of thinking that there's &quot;someone here&quot;. There's not. There are lots of voices, many millions of people. Music allows us to slice this up in new ways. "/>
				<outline text="I would happily join the Curtis Mayfield club, or fans of The Bangles, Joan Baez, Ian Drury, Bob Marley or Jerry Garcia, but I have little interest in Britany Spears or other teen idols. I want my music, I'm an adult, I pay for stuff I use, and the music industry doesn't serve that. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Money money">
				<outline text="OK, now let's talk some business."/>
				<outline text="I have been very lucky in the stock and real estate markets. I have lots of money. I'm optimistic about the future, I think I'm going to keep making money. As Alan Greenspan knows, I'm likely to spend more money. The economy is still booming. There are lots of people like me."/>
				<outline text="But here's my problem, there aren't enough things that cost money that I really care about. The money isn't that valuable to me if all I can buy are refrigerators, cars and computers. They don't inspire me or reach me. But music does. And music on the Internet *really* inspires me."/>
				<outline text="I love to spend money on music. But I hardly ever spend money when I think I'm doing something dishonest. I'm a voter, both politically and economically. I vote for candidates I support (there are very few of them, a similar problem, also solvable) and I vote for products I believe in, by buying them."/>
				<outline text="But I must pay money to the artists. This is the big catch for the music industry. They clearly don't want to give much money to the artists. They talk about the artists all the time. But I think the artists aren't actually getting the money. This is bad. "/>
				<outline text="The middlemen, such as Napster, aren't that interesting either; they're only made interesting because they're the target of the lawsuit. Let's start a conversation between users and artists. Let's cut out the middlemen and get down to business."/>
				<outline text="To the artists, how much money do you want? We haven't heard much from you. Why? What do you believe about us? I think someone is lying to you, and I think I know who, it's the same people who have been lying to us, the music industry."/>
				<outline text="It's time to hear from the musicians. "/>
				<outline text="What kind of thrill do *you* want?"/>

			<outline text="Show them the money">
				<outline text="Yesterday we were talking about Napster, of course, on the UserLand discussion group. Some people said they wanted to boycott the music industry in protest over the looming shutdown of Napster. "/>
				<outline text="I took the other side, I said it was time to go to the record stores and buy lots of CDs and let the people in the store know, politely, that we're buying music to show support for Napster. Perhaps even hand them a greeting card they can keep or give to their boss. (It's possible that music store people like Napster too.)"/>
				<outline text="There's no clearer way to show the economic power of Napster users. Show them the money. That's what the music industry is asking us to do. It's such a small thing, compared to the value of music. So let's flood their coffers with cash, and see where that goes. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Napster's &quot;buycott&quot;">
				<outline text="The management at Napster must see it the same way because they've started a &quot;buycott&quot; page listing artists that support Napster."/>
				<outline text="http://www.napster.com/buycott.html "/>
				<outline text="On that list I see one of my favorite bands, the Grateful Dead. I didn't know they supported Napster. Is there a statement somewhere on the Web? Spread the word. Grateful Dead fans have lots of love and lots of money. "/>
				<outline text="Even though I already have every Grateful Dead CD, I'm going to Tower Records in Mountain View at 3PM on Sunday to buy $100 of Grateful Dead music. Deadheads who love Napster can organize their own buycotts. Bribe the music industry to support us, to join us in the joy of music on the Internet. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Remember the mainframes">
				<outline text="Before there were personal computers there were mainframes, multi-million dollar machines run by powerful people who didn't care what the users wanted. I know about this, I programmed mainframes when I was very young. I couldn't stand it, they were so complicated, so hard to use, but that's how you did computing before the revolution."/>
				<outline text="In the late 1970s a revolution started, entrepreneurs created &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; computers, each person could have their own computer, and while they didn't have the computing and storage capacity of mainframes, they were much more powerful because users controlled them, and could use them any way they wanted to."/>
				<outline text="Before the Internet revolution, music worked like mainframes. People who don't care very much about users programmed music, and gave us what they want us to hear, not what we want to listen to. Commercial radio is not really about music, it's about getting people to listen to commercials. This has been going on for decades, whole lifetimes, and it's run it's course. Now users have the power to program music for themselves."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Radio on the desktop">
				<outline text="With the explosion of music on the Internet comes an opportunity to route around commercial radio stations, as personal computers routed around mainframes, and do for ourselves what the programmers won't do. That's where we're going next. UserLand is working on personal radio station software. It's pretty heavy stuff. Next week."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Thanks to the music industry">
				<outline text="Believe it or not, I'd like to thank the music industry for bringing money into the discussion again. Open source hype destroyed the economy of software. Now perhaps we can rebuild it, based on reality. There really is a joy to spending money on things you love. It's simple, and fair, and realistic."/>
				<outline text="The music industry hasn't heard this message, but it's been out there, in the air for them to tune into any time they want. The software industry has already been decimated by the culture of piracy, both in ideas and implementations, through patents, open source and the Internet bubble. "/>
				<outline text="We can get our interests aligned and work together, now that the open source hype has faded, and the Internet bubble has burst, and at the same time we can (we will) empower users to have it their way with music."/>
				<outline text="Yes yes yes, money matters. We want to run honorable businesses, with customers who pay. In other words, we want the same thing the music industry wants. I think Hummer-Winblad, the backers of Napster, would agree with this."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A two-way Cluetrain">
				<outline text="The computer and entertainment industries are now converging, as many predicted they would. Let's change both industries for the better. "/>
				<outline text="The first step is to show the music companies that we mean business. Give them the money, and then the conversation can continue, without destroying Napster, without destroying our love. Let's make the world better. "/>
				<outline text="And then let's get the computer industry back on track, let's put a price on our software, and ask the users to be honorable, and pay for what they use."/>
				<outline text="To the users, the Cluetrain is a two-way railroad. If you want great music and software, and dedicated and responsible creative people doing the work, there's got to be money in it. "/>
				<outline text="It's time to get out the credit cards and checkbooks, and pony up."/>

			<outline text="Stop everything and read this NY Times piece">
				<outline text="&quot;It was perhaps the most arcane statement in all the hours of acronym-filled testimony, one that came on the last day of the six-day trial. But it may have been a turning point in an important battle over the limits of a new copyright law, a potential landmark case that ended its trial phase last week in Manhattan and now awaits a verdict by the judge."/>
				<outline text="&quot;More news coverage may have been devoted to the recent legal wranglings over Napster, the Web service that the recording industry has accused of abetting widespread music piracy. But the Manhattan case, involving the copying of DVD movie disks, may have more far-reaching effects -- both on the way cultural products are consumed and on whether &lt;i&gt;computer code is deemed to be speech deserving of First Amendment protection.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/31rite.html"/>
				<outline text="I've been saying this for years, to lawyers, to experts on patents including Lawrence Lessig, and everyone tells me I'm out of my mind, but I know it's right. "/>
				<outline text="There is no difference between code and writing. I think I can prove it. Manila, the content management system that I use, supports macros. When you put text in curly braces, as the page is rendered, the macro is evaluated. Such macros can be embedded in protected speech, ie prose. What goes inside the curly braces is program logic. So if I want First Amendment protection for my code all I have to do is embed it in a Web page. "/>
				<outline text="Further, the artistic choices one makes when writing code, even when it's not embedded in a Web page, are exactly like those made when writing prose. I may be one of a very small number of people who write both ways, so I get it in a way others possibly can't. If lawyers will just listen and take this idea seriously, we can route around all kinds of insidious (and unconstitutional) limits on what software writers can write about."/>
				<outline text="In &quot;Do You Know Stephen King?&quot;, 7/24/00: &quot;To put it in analogous terms for writers, imagine if you couldn't write a story because Dean Koontz had already written it. What if the idea were as basic as Boy Meets Girl? That's what's going on in another creative space, software.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Bet on this changing, if this case goes through, as the Times says, it will have far-reaching effects. Software patents won't be worth the paper they're printed on, once again software writers will be free."/>

				<outline text="Ooooh. Let me catch my breath. Whew."/>
				<outline text="Music. Get up on the dance floor. She's still singin!"/>
				<outline text="Music. That's what's going on these days, music on the Internet is the catalyst for everything else on the Internet. Middlemen grabbing headlines, taking shots at other middlemen, Napster is down, Napster is back. Napster, Napster, Napster. Those who know better scold the music industry, rightly so, for focusing all the attention on Napster, now their flow is booming at unprecedented levels. But what can Napster do with the flow? They can't settle with the music industry. Nowhere to go. They can't let their body go with the flow. "/>
				<outline text="Wait. In the meantime the users download free music, the artists still aren't being paid, and everyone wants to know how it's going to shake out."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Cheap WSJ shot">
				<outline text="The Wall Street Journal took a totally cheap shot at Napster, in a much-cited article, they say Napster is open with others' intellectual property, but jealously guards its own. The charges are worth about a paragraph of rebuttal. A short one."/>
				<outline text="I own no Napster stock, have no interest in the company. I use their product but so do 20 million other people. I have a lot of experience with open and closed protocols in the software industry. Napster's is open. It's one of the first things I checked out."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The technology industry">
				<outline text="There are at least two sides to the technology industry in the music-on-the-Internet revolution."/>
				<outline text="On one side, pity the Internet music companies, started before the Napster craze; the ones who have been trying to work with the music industry. They've been playing by the rules, while Napster blew through them. It's impossible to know what kinds of deals they've made with the music industry, but so far none of them have jumped over to the other side, to compete with Napster. "/>
				<outline text="On the other side, there are hardware and system software vendors who merely make devices for recording and playing MP3s. They have nothing to fear from the music industry, because both law and money are on their side. The information technology industry is an order of magnitude larger than the music industry. I have a feeling if it were the other way we wouldn't have writable CD-ROMs. "/>
				<outline text="At the same time, the service agreements of home connectivity providers are as busted as the distribution system of the music companies. Users are prohibited from running servers in their homes. Well, Napster is a server. This opens the door for other kinds of servers. This is good! As a software developer, I know that there's a meditative magic to running a server. There will be lots of cool products in this space, so ISPs, revise those agreements and start promoting. &quot;We're the best for running Napster.&quot; Go go go."/>
				<outline text="There's a new boom coming for sure, as all those happy Napster users will buy bigger hard disks, bigger pipes, new portable music-playing devices, low-power FM transmitters so the music the computer plays can be heard anywhere in the home or office."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Meet the new boss">
				<outline text="As this happens, as we throw out the old bosses, the Hollywood execs who are still having the wrong argument with the wrong people, what's the likelihood that the new bosses, whoever they are, will be any more freedom-loving than the old ones? In other words, what's the chance that there will be an explosion of creativity and expression to go along with the huge wealth that will be created from the economic shift?"/>
				<outline text="This is the question that Steve Wozniak keeps asking. It's the right question. Don't trust a middleman who says &quot;You can trust me.&quot; Never. The moment will come when we will be asked to do that. Trust me. ;-&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Middlemen, middlemen, everywhere you look. Lots of users. Many of them like getting music for free. The artists still aren't getting paid. They want the problem to go away. That's not realistic."/>
				<outline text="So, will the new be better than the old?"/>
				<outline text="I don't know the answer to this question."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Where's the messiah?">
				<outline text="Find me an inspiring musician who loves using and creating for the Internet. That's someone I want to work with. That could be our messiah, the Beatles of the new medium. "/>
				<outline text="I'm not kidding about messiah-hood. John Lennon said the Beatles were more popular than Christ. When he defended himself I understood what he meant. He didn't mean disrespect to Christ. It was a simple (and true) observation. People cared more what Lennon thought. "/>
				<outline text="That's the kind of musician I want. "/>
				<outline text="Until he or she or they come it's going to be middlemen and moneymakers, frustrating each other, fighting over money. Eventually, probably soon, the music industry will feel it in the pocketbook, and then it will die. "/>
				<outline text="Will more music be made? I think so. Will the artists get paid? Maybe not. "/>
				<outline text="There has to be artistic possibility in this new medium. A new kind of inspiration, musical, emotive, strong, not afraid of the Internet. When that comes online, however it comes, then we'll know what this medium really means."/>

				<outline text="This is a short piece. A reminder to the music industry that we haven't heard back from them on two important questions raised in earlier pieces."/>
				<outline text="1. Several artists, including Roger McGuinn and Courtney Love, have said publicly they don't make money from music distribution, touring or merchandise. I've spoken privately with people in the music industry who say that Love and McGuinn are correct. I find this confusing, because in press statements the industry speaks on behalf of the artists, never themselves. Is music piracy hurting the musicians financially? Would they get less money even if all sales through distribution were to stop?"/>
				<outline text="2. I pointed to a search engine at AOL's WinAmp subsidiary that does the same thing as Napster. It indexes users' hard drives and provides a convenient way to download music. It actually does more, it can store the music for you, on their server, in a &quot;locker.&quot; (As a Napster user I wish they had this feature. I wish they would cache the music on more readily-accessible servers.)"/>
				<outline text="Now these may or may not be legally relevant questions, but to music users these questions are extremely important."/>

We've been emailing about music, so I wanted to get together with him to talk. It was a great show, KD Lang was the opening act for Sting. I had never seen Lang perform live, and she is totally inspiring. "/>
				<outline text="Woz is not a Napster user. He tried Macster and it didn't work. He's too busy. And get this, Woz uses Tower Records like others use Napster. He bought all the albums by all artists whose name begins with C. Woz has lots of money, and uses it creatively."/>
				<outline text="I asked about the story that he wrote a program to crack Visicalc's copy protection, and he gleefully told me that not only was it true, but his program improved Visicalc's disk performance. (I was an author for the company that published Visicalc.)"/>
				<outline text="I encouraged Woz to get into the public discussion on Napster. He has a long well-known history of interest in music. He is also the rare icon of the software industry whose integrity is unassailable. He's the original wizzy-wig guy, he'll tell you what he thinks. You don't have to read between the lines with Woz."/>

			<outline text="Doc raises a question">
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2000/08/06&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;More than one developer has told me that the Amazon patent has had the effect of stifling software development in the conceptual vicinity of the affiliate program patent. That patent, it seems, scares money away. The VCs don't want the risk, and there are too many other tempting investments.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I'm one of the developers Doc is talking about. First, I didn't know that Doc stopped linking to Amazon, and for that I am thankful. Thanks Doc! "/>
				<outline text="From my point of view, patents screw up the whole software development process. Like book authors, the best software products are &lt;i&gt;assimilations&lt;/i&gt; of stuff that came before. I encourage every software developer to use my software, and I hope they do the same, in the hope that good ideas get out there, and make everything work better. I also think proper credit should be given when you use an idea that made a difference in making your concept work. "/>
				<outline text="I think it goes without saying that patents are a big fence around ideas saying &quot;if you go here you have to pay me&quot; or worse &quot;you can't go here.&quot; That goes against the philosophy that competition is good for everyone. This is an American concept, afaik, and one of our biggest strengths as a culture and an economy. And it also means that to be a developer you at least have to have a lawyer as a soulmate, and while I have great respect for my lawyer, I don't want him designing the software, nor do I think he wants to design the software."/>
				<outline text="Imagine Doc if you couldn't cite an author whose work you admire? If you couldn't use someone else's idea to build your thesis? All we're asking for is the same kind of freedom that authors such as yourself have."/>
				<outline text="If only Amazon used patents as competitive weapons, it wouldn't be the big problem that it is. Even so, investors generally will not fund development that's competitive with Amazon in the two known areas they have patents. Further, it's a minefield, it takes three-four years to get a patent through the USPTO. So the patents filed in 1998 won't come public until next year or the year after. So we just don't know how awful a situation it is, but every day, more ridiculous patents are being issued, and the lawyers get more and more involved in our art."/>
				<outline text="I'm sorry you're not getting the money from Wordsworth. However it's OK with me. You've put your stake firmly in the open source philosophy, which imho is a vast oversimplification of the software process. But one thing it clearly stands for is the elimination of creative barriers in software development. So this is an opportunity for you to pay a price for your beliefs. That's OK with me, because having a philosophy has consequences, if you're true to it."/>
				<outline text="As a friend, it's always troubled me that you're willing to promote revolution in my art, but when it hits your pocketbook, well, that's when you stop being such a revolutionary. I have the same concern with O'Reilly, the central promoter of open source, which certainly does not open source their books; when asked why, explains that they have to make money. Same with Phil Hughes, your employer. They're willing to advocate revolution, as long as it doesn't hit &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; bottom line. (If O'Reilly and Hughes were true to their cause, I'd be able to read Linux Journal fully on the Web for free, and every O'Reilly book would be on the Web, indexed by Google, etc.)"/>

			<outline text="Prince">
				<outline text="Today several pieces appeared on the Web that are noteworthy in the development of music on the Internet. The first is from the artist once again known as Prince, a mysterious man who makes luscious music, and has been independent of the music industry in various ways that aren't very clear to me."/>
				<outline text="The Prince article, if he wrote it, is quite clear on the morality of music on the Internet. He's in agreement with Courtney Love's theme, and goes further, to him music users can be more than contributors to the tip jar, we're given some credit for intelligence and ethics, which is more than I can say for the music industry and the press, who label us pirates, often without questioning the label."/>
				<outline text="For technical reasons the Prince article is impossible to point to. To read it, which I strongly encourage you to do, go to his site:"/>
				<outline text="http://www.npgonlineltd.com/freedomnews.html"/>
				<outline text="Then click on 4 The Love of Music. Scroll through the article. I know it's a frustrating read. But it's worth reading in full. Here's a quote to motivate you."/>
				<outline text="&quot;The real music lover looks 4 an MP3 of the song online, downloads it and burns it on2 a CD. He knows that he doesn't have a perfect copy of the song (MP3 is, after all, a sound 4mat which does involve a certain amount of loss in sound quality), and it is clear, in his mind, that if the original album is ever released under the above-mentioned conditions, he will purchase it, bcuz he wants 2 discover other, lesser known tracks by the artist that r not available online, bcuz he wants the best possible quality, bcuz he wants 2 xperience the original release in all its aspects (cover artwork, song selection, etc.) and bcuz he wants 2 compensate the artist 4 his work. But y should the music lover have 2 wait 5 years, 10 years or even longer until the record company condescends 2 re-releasing the original work of the artist? Y should the record company have such control over how he, the music lover, wants 2 xperience the music?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Except for the part about burning CDs, exactly right! Why should we wait? Or put another way, haven't we waited long enough?"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/13/00; 9:39:41 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Likes and dislikes">
				<outline text="Over the years I've probably had 200 meetings with Microsoft people. There are a lot of things I like about the Microsoft culture, on a person-to-person basis. I like that they accept a challenge, you can say something direct like &quot;That's totally brain-dead&quot; and they don't get up from the table, in fact it seems to draw them in. "/>
				<outline text="But I've learned, sometimes the hard way, not to take that approach with people at other technology firms. Perhaps this is the biggest difference between Microsoft and the rest of the industry. The Microsoft culture seeks out adversaries, where others recoil in response to a challenge, but they're no less aggressive, the response is just postponed. Eventually it comes. The rest of the industry is not unagressive, it's just more impersonal, less immediate."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I'm a legal alien">
				<outline text="Music always plays a big role in my writing, sometimes invisibly, and frequently, quite visibly. In this piece you'll hear the music of Sting, singing &quot;Englishman in New York&quot;. It's my new theme song. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.math.uni-goettingen.de/engehaus/de/songs.htm#s1 "/>
				<outline text="I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien, I'm an Englishman in New York."/>
				<outline text="La lalaa lala lalaall la lalala la. Be yourself no matter what they say."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is leadership?">
				<outline text="I may be flirting with the music industry but I'm still firmly rooted in the technology industry. The convergence so many predicted is happening. Media merge. We're all Englishmen in New York. I don't take coffee, I drink tea, my dear. (In other words we think differently.)"/>
				<outline text="I wish my industry had done more to prepare for this convergence, then perhaps we would be able to help get the users what they want in music more quickly and with less confusion. Our unfinished business is defining leadership, and then finding some leaders who are worth following."/>
				<outline text="I had this discussion with two Microsoft people on Friday, Linda Stone and David Stutz. It's their job to visit with people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere to find out how Microsoft is perceived. As Linda says &quot;My job is to be ears.&quot; That's a good job to have."/>
				<outline text="Everything I talked about with Linda and David revolved around a single concept, leadership. So it made sense to try to say what leadership is. And from that maybe we can actually have some."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Think of a jungle">
				<outline text="Think of an industry as a jungle with villages. Our species is great at evolution (relative to other species) so our villages compete. We compare ourselves to other villages. Perhaps we even hate the other villages, and we try to burn them down. That would be a human thing to do, for sure."/>
				<outline text="But while we're busy attacking and rebuilding after attacks, one village grows so large that it dominates the other villages. That village has some serious thinking to do about where it wants to go. Because if it looks at where its ideas come from, where its motivation comes from, it's often not coming from inside, it's coming from the competition with other villages, no matter how much they despise them. Without competition, our species just doesn't invent much, doesn't evolve."/>
				<outline text="This could be about Microsoft, or I could be talking about the United States (when viewed from other countries) or it could be the global economy. Something interesting happened just before any of us were born. The human species acquired the power to destroy the whole jungle. We haven't done it yet, but we're workin on it. Somehow, even though we have terribly flawed political processes in the east and the west, we haven't yet had a leader that wanted to cash in all the chips for the whole species. This is good!"/>
				<outline text="But Microsoft, that's another story. On Friday I swapped in my Microsoft stories in preparation for the meeting with Linda and David. I would never let Bill Gates have his finger on the button. There's no price too high for the rest of us to pay for his victory. He'd make a bad leader."/>
				<outline text="The President of the United States sometimes has to do something that's not great for the US to keep the whole world going. It might feel good for a moment to let some small country have it, and wipe them off the face of the earth, but the aftermath would be so unpleasant, our presidents don't even try anymore. Perhaps before nuclear weapons, the US could have a president, who like Gates wanted victory in every battle no matter what the cost. But it's not that way anymore for our presidents. The stakes eventually get too high, too unthinkable."/>
				<outline text="This is what Microsoft hasn't understood yet, even though it's been said so many ways by so many people. They have filters at Microsoft that keep this idea from penetrating. It's really simple. A boy always fights when provoked. A man can choose not to. A leader must choose not to."/>
				<outline text="&quot;It takes more than combat gear to make a man, takes more than license for a gun. Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can, a gentleman will walk but never run.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's simple">
				<outline text="Leadership is very simple if you look at it this way. "/>
				<outline text="The jungle comes first, then the village."/>
				<outline text="As we get more powerful, do more things to enhance the jungle."/>
				<outline text="A new village lead by a young blustery chief is not a threat. We understand history, and know that big powerful villages take a long time to disappear, contrary to what Gates says. "/>
				<outline text="If the leader of the most powerful village aligns his interests with those of the jungle, the village will probably continue, and so will the jungle. Hey Rome and Athens went down pretty hard, but they're still there. So are IBM and Apple."/>
				<outline text="This is a lesson not just for Gates, and the next US president, but also for the leaders of any would-be dominant village. Start from day one with respect for the jungle. Don't pave it over. Keep it wild and interesting. Judge other people's ideas based on this practice and we'll all go somewhere."/>
				<outline text="For Gates, the issue was Netscape, a tiny village camped out in tents painted to look like a fortress in a gorgeous grove in the middle of the jungle. In comes Gates with flamethrowers and tanks. Air cover and spies. After the battle the grove is no longer gorgeous. It's useful, but not so inspiring."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Bees in Y2K">
				<outline text="It's mid-August so the first scouts in the annual Bee Invasion are looking for food for the troops. I started talking about them on Scripting News yesterday, an annual ritual, and John Callender asked why I can't peacefully coexist with the bees (which are really yellowjackets) since they never sting. Since I really like writing about the Bees, I wanted to run my answer through the mail list."/>
				<outline text="&quot;I'm a pretty lazy guy when it comes to killing other animals, so peaceful coexistence was my first approach. I don't know why it didn't work, but I have a theory. I'm a product of genetic evolution. For whatever reason my internal programming is constantly generating alerts when yellowjackets are buzzing around various parts of my body. There must be a huge body chemistry reaction of fear in my blood and nervous system. Fight or flight is triggered. &quot;This is not a safe place&quot; all my senses say. So while at a conscious level, like you, I know that they can't do me any harm, my body says something totally opposite.&quot;"/>

I've always thought of myself as a medium speed fan, but we're going to talk about the high-speed kind on Saturday."/>
				<outline text="So what are fans about? And why are human beings such fans? Where did the word come from? What do fans do? And what do fans do now that we are on the Internet?"/>
				<outline text="Perhaps we're just beginning to get an idea of what's possible. Until music exploded on the Internet all we could do is dream about it. Now it's clear that all kinds of collaboration are possible. We can share our favorites and discoveries, our collections, playlists, and when aggregated, we can feed back information to the music industry in ways Hollywood execs can only dream about. "/>

			<outline text="Clay Shirky">
				<outline text="Clay Shirky wrote an op-ed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/00/07/15/oped/15shir.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the NY Times on July 15. It was a milestone piece for me; he put in words the experience I was having, at a time when most of the press reports were about piracy. Shirky went to the heart of the matter, our hearts, our collective experience and the joy of discovery and sharing discoveries. That's part of being a fan, for sure."/>
				<outline text="Talking with Shirky earlier this week, we both felt that the shift would fully happen when a popular artist emerged who embraced the Internet, used it as his or her stage, to do a kind of music that couldn't be done in the old medium. At that point the music companies will break rank, and will want to be part of the medium, instead of fighting it."/>
				<outline text="At some point, I'd like to have a conference where visionaries like Shirky, and technology developers like myself get together to simply share our beliefs. Even though many of us are in full agreement on how it's going to evolve, I learn a lot from just talking about it and listening to others. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dinner in Palo Alto?">
				<outline text="There's also been discussion among technology vendors of a weekly dinner in the Valley to discuss the new medium. Back in the late 1980s when the multimedia industry was getting started in San Francisco, they had a series of dinners called Chinatown, sponsored by MacroMind (which later became Macromedia) where people met to talk about standards. The resulting industry can be seen today on Townsend Street and Third Street, and even the Financial District of San Francisco. Very often if you get the right people together, physically, progress can happen very quickly."/>
				<outline text="The timing is good because a lot of the technology people have made investments that are now obsolete. The big issues, as far as I'm concerned are canonical identifiers for artists, albums and songs; and payment systems that acknowledge the new method of distribution. To be clear, I just want to develop software; I'm not interested in anyone else's money, and I think people should pay for what they use. However, being a software designer, I know that ease of use comes first."/>

			<outline text="My bandwidth story">
				<outline text="Yesterday I almost got thrown off the stage at the Bandwidth conference in San Francisco. I could hardly finish a sentence. "/>
				<outline text="In previous sessions they had been tip-toeing around the central issue, people were talking about the music industry as if Napster had never happened. On my panel I was determined that we would get and stay connected to reality. "/>
				<outline text="I asked for a show of hands, how many people think that Napster and Napster-likes are the mode of the future for music use? Everyone agreed, including the panelists. "/>
				<outline text="Even so, they gave their pitches as if Napster didn't exist. I warned them beforehand that as a moderator, I interrupt. Some people don't like it, but it isn't personal. Watch the best interviewers on TV and radio, they do it too. The moderator's first responsibility is to the audience. If I'm getting bored, it's a sure thing they are too. And by asking challenging questions, people start thinking and participating."/>
				<outline text="These can be the very best sessions, if I get support from the people who run the show. I had a rebellious panelist at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/04/21/CanAppleSurvive&quot;&gt;Can Apple Survive?&lt;/a&gt; panel at Seybold/New York 1997, when Gil Amelio was running the company. It was the right time to ask that question. The users had a lot of concerns. The Apple guy tried to get me replaced as the moderator during the warmup session. Craig Cline, the editorial director, politely told him to get over it. "/>
				<outline text="It was a great discussion, I cut people off when they were droning, asked the questions they didn't want asked. I was careful to ask the new Apple guy a couple of leading questions, and to thank him for participating in a panel that asked a question that must be hard to deal with. I honestly think that panel helped Apple survive. Sweeping questions under the rug doesn't get rid of the questions, it just postpones dealing with them."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday, the editorial director, Ashli Lewis, did the wrong thing, imho, she stepped in and started running the show. The subject didn't change. The conversation still revolved around empowered fans listening to the music they want to listen to and the industry saying it's bad. There were a lot of hurt feelings. Too bad, we could have learned a lot more, especially my panelists who have been routed around as the music fans have taken over. "/>
				<outline text="(This morning I'm listening to Tevya, played by Zero Mostel, asking his wife if she loves him, a gorgeous duet, an Americanization of a Russian-Jewish way of life; and Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell singing &quot;It Just Takes Two&quot;, a Motown version of the same theme. Show me a radio station that will play both those songs 5 times back-to-back. I just want to program music for myself, it's a pretty simple idea.)"/>
				<outline text="I stayed on stage, and eventually resumed my role as moderator. Of course they don't like being routed around, so say it, but keep it professional. It was one of the toughest jobs I've ever had, esp when they started talking about *me* in not very kind terms. I kept my mouth shut. It was great theater, I was the foil for the disdain the companies have for music lovers. They complain that we don't respect them, but they have little respect for us; you could see that being acted out on stage. I had the last word, and that's how it's going to go in the market, like it or not. The users always win. "/>
				<outline text="(If you want users to behave responsibly, start treating them like adults, not children, and that means listen, and be quiet when they talk.)"/>
				<outline text="I talked with Ms. Lewis later, she said she was afraid the panelists would walk off the stage. To which I said, that's their right, they can do it if they want to, but for one hour that stage was mine. A good editor must step back and let the show go on. My last comment on stage was that no one fell asleep during this panel. I'm sure it's true. "/>
				<outline text="I took a walk, got a coffee at Starbuck's and came back and participated in a discussion lead by Ken Rutkowski and Brian Zisk. Guess what, we talked about the same things. This time the execs weren't there, so no one told us to shut up. They missed the best part of the show, and an opportunity to learn how their business really works now."/>

Better to clean house now, change your practices, open up processes, look at ways you're holding back progress. Make your practices match your hype, or stop hyping.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/23/00; 11:22:42 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Are you one?">
				<outline text="Following the theme &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/08/22/squealWithCare&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in yesterday's DaveNet piece, let's start routing around the softballs and puff pieces, and figure out what integrity means in software development."/>
				<outline text="Since the high ground in software integrity has been captured by the &quot;open source&quot; developers, we're going to start by figuring out exactly what an open source developer is. "/>
				<outline text="There's been a lot of writing on the subject, mostly by people who love the idea, but there is no commonly agreed-to definition. There are lots of different license agreements, some highly political, some which eliminate developers who do any commercial code at all, and others that say roughly &quot;here's my gift, use it as you please and don't bother me.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Most of the agreements are silent on the subject of patents and disclosure of prior art. Perhaps there's an opportunity to channel the generosity of most programmers to offset and prevent greed by others, if there's a consensus that being pro-open source is consistent with being anti-patent. "/>
				<outline text="There are also gatekeepers at work, people who decide who is an open source developer or not. If being accepted by a gatekeeper is part of what makes someone an open source developer, let's get clear on who they are, and understand how their process works. Preferably, whether you're an open source developer or not is a matter between you and your conscience. I prefer to trust people by default, and do the whole thing without any gatekeepers at all."/>
				<outline text="Greed and manipulation are the way of life in US business, but often it's not so with programmers. There's a higher ethic among good developers, that's why the whole open source philosophy, as weakly as it has been defined, has a strong ring of truth. &quot;Sure I share what I create!&quot; is a common ethos, dating back to the beginning of computers and software, on all platforms, because programmers, like all artists, are suckers for love and appreciation. We share what we create because that's an essential part of what we do."/>
				<outline text="I'm in favor of programmers doing that, but let's not be picky about who we accept our gifts from. That's my own personal opinion, of course."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A discussion">
				<outline text="If you create software, I'm interested in hearing what you have to say about this. I want to know what it means when someone says they're an open source developer."/>
				<outline text="I'm working with Eric Kidd, a 24-year-old open source developer with excellent qualifications. Wherever possible I'm taking a backseat and letting him run the discussion. He writes excellent code and has great integrity. I know all this because I've programmed with Eric at UserLand. I trust him."/>
				<outline text="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19977 "/>
				<outline text="If you're any kind of programmer, open source, closed source, open mind, closed mind, whatever, come participate and help get to the core of what being an open source programmer means, and then let's work outward from there, and hopefully include as many people as possible."/>
				<outline text="However if you don't write code as a daily activity, you're welcome to watch, but this is for us to decide, not for outsiders. Thanks."/>
				<outline text="Further if this subject is being discussed elsewhere, send me pointers and I'll link to them from Scripting News."/>
				<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
				<outline text="PS: I see this as exactly analogous to the debate in music between artists and the industry. The artists should define the industry, not the other way around, of course, imho."/>
				<outline text="PPS: It's also parallel to the debate in the medical industry, between doctors and the HMOs. Now that software development has been going full force for fifty years, it's time that we take responsibility for defining what we do. If we don't do it, outsiders are happy to do it for us."/>

				<outline text="I got an email from a student at MIT with some very welcome news. Here's the text of the email."/>
				<outline text="&quot;A friend of mine tipped me that Scripting News has been covering the ever-more-bizarre digital music distribution controversy, so I thought you might be interested in hearing the latest from the MIT bomb-throwing contingent."/>
				<outline text="&quot;Basically what we're working on is an 'audio fingerprinting algorithm.' Given a few seconds of audio, we can compute a unique fingerprint that doesn't change even if the audio is compressed, played back at a different volume, distorted slightly, etc -- ideally we're shooting for an algorithm that's robust to attack, ie, it's impossible to change the fingerprint substantially without distorting the music beyond anything you'd want to listen to. (There are all kinds of fun psychoacoustics happening, just like in MP3 compression.)"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Then, based on these several-second 'subfingerprints', we can match an entire music file against a database in a way that is robust to having the beginning clipped off, the middle 25% being replaced with a different song, etc, by looking at the match offsets between successive subfingerprints."/>
				<outline text="&quot;Once you've found the song in the database you can do all kinds of fun things. You have authentic artist, title, and copyright information. You can do collaborative filtering based on what people listen to and suggest other music the user might like. You can rip music automatically in bulk off the radio or stream servers. You can build realtime 'netplay' popularity charts based on what mp3's are playing all around the world *right now*. You can find where samples within a track came from (well, if we get performance that far up.) You can link to lyrics or the band's webpage. You could have a one-click 'give this artist $.10' button (see www.fairtunes.com.) You can stop people from renaming mp3's of their own band (or people screaming in German) to 'unforgiven.mp3' and posting them to Napster. And lots more stuff. There are some more ideas on our webpage (www.tuneprint.com) and I'm sure there's lots of stuff we haven't thought of yet."/>
				<outline text="&quot;We're trying to be open-source, but we need to get someone to sponsor the server cluster too."/>
				<outline text="&quot;If you know other people who might be interested, or if you have any tips on how we can get the word out, we'd of course love it if you passed it on :)&quot;"/>
				<outline text="geoff@tuneprint.com"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A great fit">
				<outline text="So far I haven't talked about Radio UserLand in this column, I wanted to wait until it's ready for prime time. Many of the ideas that Geoff talks about above are already working in our software, but we've been looking for what they promise, a way to know what song you're pointing at, so we can tell if you have it in your music collection. That's key for community and collaborative features, and eventually for linking up to the commerce systems that we hope the music industry is developing. I'll keep you posted as we learn more about what the MIT students are doing."/>

				<outline text="Yesterday I got two emails that got me going, and neither of them had anything to do with open source or DeCSS. One came from BK Delong, an XML developer who was at the Scripting News dinner in Amsterdam in May. He wondered if we'd do the same thing in San Francisco this week when lots of publishing developers are in town for Seybold. &quot;Good idea!&quot; I said, so I sent an email to Liz Grady, who manages the sessions for the Seybold show, asking if we could do an evening session. She said yes, almost immediately."/>
				<outline text="The other email came from a reporter at Wired News who wanted to know if there would be a gathering of a Weblog people in SF next week. He asked the question in an irritating way, using the brand name of one of our competitors to describe a category we pioneered. Oy! I used to write for Wired. Look at what they're resorting to. It wouldn't surprise me if my irritation appeared in Wired. Shit happens, I guess."/>
				<outline text="Hey I got an email today from Tim O'Reilly where he used the word michegas, one that I use frequently on Scripting News. How did an Irishman come to use such a term?

			<outline text="Napster at Seybold">
				<outline text="On Tuesday I did two sessions at Seybold, one on Napster, and the other an informal face-to-face discussion between Scripting News and DaveNet readers. "/>
				<outline text="Based on the experience at the Broadband conference, earlier in August, I expected the Napster session to be a raucous unprofessional brawl. I thought the Seybold people would be up in arms over Napster, in the same way they didn't like the Web in the mid-90s. At that time, I was the outsider, bringing them bad tidings. &quot;The Web is going to change everything you do,&quot; I would say. And they would say &quot;We don't think so.&quot; And sometimes the voices would raise and the so would the tempers. "/>
				<outline text="But it wasn't like that on Tuesday. We had an interesting thoughtful and professional discussion, and all of the comments were pro-Napster, in favor of using music on the Internet, sympathetic to the artists, and critical of the music industry for trying to stop Napster. So why didn't we go through the same experience Tuesday when discussing music on the Internet? Well, one theory is that this is about someone else's intellectual property, not theirs, so what's there to worry about? However, if that was true, we wouldn't have covered all the bases, and we did cover them all. "/>
				<outline text="So here's what I think. The Web changed the publishing industry. All the stuff I write is on the Web, and if you write for a newspaper or magazine, all yours is too. The business model of the Web, which caused all the trouble in the mid-90s is still undecided. Ads on Web pages don't make enough money to support all the editorial processes used in creating a publication. But if you're in the publishing industry and you haven't come to grips with this, you're probably not in the publishing industry anymore."/>
				<outline text="One comment from an editor of the Christian Science Monitor, whose name I didn't catch, was particularly poignant. He talked about the model for the newspaper of the future revolving around (what I call) amateur journalism. The power is with the authors now, he said, and they will only get more powerful in the future,. This is a dramatic change in pov from a few years ago. Even I, the radical in Seybold-space, wanted to temper that. People still want to know who said what. Reputations and track records matter. I explained what weblogs are, an Epinions user spoke, and we came to an agreement. Music will go the same way as print has. Dead trees and CDs are the old way. There's a new way coming. How will it work? We don't know."/>
				<outline text="A father of a fourteen-year-old said the teens think they will get all their music for free. I said that may change as they get older, or it may not. Certainly &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; parents didn't think the world we were creating would work. We marched on Washington, many of us refused to fight in Vietnam, we didn't like the president and we said so. We had birth control, so we could have sex without having children. All these things stripped the gears of our parents' generation. "/>
				<outline text="So, following that pattern, figuring out how the music industry of the future works, and the publishing industry of the future, will not be our problem, it will be theirs. "/>
				<outline text="BTW, the great thing about music at these conferences is that the AV guys get involved in the discussion. They're all musicians!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What haven't we talked about yet?">
				<outline text="We've certainly dealt with software and copy protection, that happened in the 80s, and then in the 90s with the &quot;open source&quot; movement, which I'll talk about more in future pieces. "/>
				<outline text="Newspapers and magazines were assimilated in the mid-90s through the Web, and the music industry got dragged into the future by Napster. "/>
				<outline text="The movie industry is still relatively immune because of the huge size of their files, but even they have gotten messed up with their legal travails and abuse of the First Amendment re DeCSS."/>
				<outline text="So who remains? The book industry, of course. They're next. "/>
				<outline text="But first a story about Dick Brass."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dick Brass">
				<outline text="The big topic at Seybold this year was E-books and Digital Rights Management. Promoted by Microsoft, specifically Dick Brass, who I used to hang out with in the mid-80s, long before he worked at Microsoft. "/>
				<outline text="Now, people say I'm disrespectful, but I just like to have fun. Look at how other writers do it. I'm just a writer, and Dick Brass is fun, esp if you don't take him too seriously. He has such a unique way of talking, I can actually impersonate him! There's a story I love to tell about this. I introduced Dick to Adam Green, another friend from the 80s. They were going to do an LBO of Ashton-Tate (LBOs were the hot thing in the 80s). I could also impersonate Adam. In my impersonation Dick would say in his high-pitched squeal &quot;Come on Adam, let's dooooo it! You'll see, it'll be funnnn!&quot; Then Adam would lisp &quot;I'm Adam Gween, I know thdeez stheengs!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, Dick is one of the most forceful hucksters I've ever met, it can be really hard to get a word in edgewise, but he's smart, very smart, and he's passionate about the stuff he sells. In the 80s it was reference books on computers, dictionaries, thesauri, information. Dick envisioned the Web in ways that Tim Berners-Lee didn't. That was the brilliance of TBL, he built a platform that a lot of our visions could play out on."/>
				<outline text="Now Dick is the chief promoter of Microsoft's E-books initiative. They make software and define a hardware platform for reading books on a computer screen. You can read the books on an ordinary desktop computer using special software, which seems weird to me, when we already have the Web, and Microsoft has the number one Web browser. "/>
				<outline text="But I really like the idea of reading books on a portable device that plays like a book. I can see a lot of advantages for people with aging eyes like mine. I'd like to make the type bigger, much bigger, then when I'm lying down I can use more positions and stretch my lower back while doing it, instead of having to remain in one of very few positions where my eyes can read the text. So thank you for the form factor, it's going to make a big difference. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="But the DRM stuff has got to go">
				<outline text="DRM stands for Digital Rights Management, which is a fancy name for copy protection. This is such a repeating loop. First the software industry makes the mistake of not trusting their users, then the music industry embarks on an ill-fated attempt to control how music lovers can use their product, and now the book industry is doing the same thing. "/>
				<outline text="Why does this suck so much? Because there's this beautiful moment when a new medium opens up and &lt;i&gt;the art of being a user&lt;/i&gt; becomes an intoxicating experience. Our love is tapped, as is our gratitude (and our checkbooks if you don't interfere). But lurking around the corner is the paranoia of the creative person and his or her middleman, wanting to control our experience, to have an exclusive lock on the art, and the first epiphany is totally spoiled. It's as if discovering the Garden of Eden, only to find that someone deliberately broke the septic system."/>
				<outline text="That's the experience of music on the Internet. And while the E-books thing hasn't taken off yet at a consumer level, the same thing will happen there. The loudmouths are going to spoil it for everyone. Instead of experiencing the full joy of reading unleashed for old eyes, and whatever other delights there are in reading digitally, we're going to have to explain, again, to the fatcat spoilers why they have no choice but to trust their users."/>
				<outline text="Clearly the book industry is next. So many closed paranoid business models. So little trust of users. Another round of lawsuits, bumping up against the inevitable. Get the message, users are artists too. If you lock them out of their artistry, they will route around you."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What to do about RSS?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/2/00; 8:38:11 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A partial viewpoint">
				<outline text="&quot;RSS&quot; is a simple XML-based syndication format started a little over a year ago. It's become a popular format, supported by thousands of news sources, both amateur and professional. There are serious developers and companies investing in RSS-based technology. "/>
				<outline text="And now that it's caught on, it's getting heavily political, which means it's also getting more interesting. I'm right in the middle of this. What you read here is partial, it represents one viewpoint, there are others. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="How RSS got started">
				<outline text="In December 1997 I was looking for a project to do with XML, to get some experience, and to see if there were other developers who wanted to work in XML, because that's the purpose of XML, to provide common formats to allow information to flow through different applications over the Internet. "/>
				<outline text="The result was the XMLization of my news site, Scripting News, www.scripting.com. I wrote it up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt;, and some developers showed interest. Josh Lucas did an application that delivered Scripting News in email. &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/02/25/vignetteScriptingNews&quot;&gt;Vignette did&lt;/a&gt; a trial app to show their customers the benefits of XML-based interchange between content management systems."/>
				<outline text="Not much more happened between then and the winter of 1999, when we started getting random questions from people at Netscape about our format. They put up a trial app that read Scripting News in XML and rendered it in HTML. A few weeks later they came out with My.Netscape, a personalized news service, an &quot;aggregator&quot; that rendered XML channels in a format called RSS, in HTML, according to user selection. I don't know if they used our previous work as a model, let's assume for the sake of argument that it was a completely independent development. "/>
				<outline text="My feeling at the time was a combination of excitement and frustration. I wished they had worked with us, we had gone first, and shared our ideas freely. Why not build on our work? Why not work with us instead of reinventing the wheel?"/>
				<outline text="At the same time I was excited, finally one of the big names in Internet software was getting behind XML in a pragmatic way. So I chose to ignore the frustration and we got busy writing an aggregator to stand alongside Netscape's. The difference between ours and theirs is that ours would be open, the service list would not be hidden and private, it would be available to any developer who wanted to build an application that aggregated the channels. "/>
				<outline text="Netscape's channel list was not open. If we wanted channels to aggregate, we'd have to open our own registration point, which we did. Because ours was open, no one else had to do a registration point. In retrospect, perhaps we shouldn't have been so open, even though it enabled applications like Headline Viewer and Meerkat, it also made it easy to go forward with RSS without our participation. In the future, UserLand services might not be open in this way."/>
				<outline text="I also strongly disapproved of Netscape's publisher agreement, which placed huge constraints on the freedom of speech of the channels that flowed through their service. I wrote about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/03/18/everyonesEquallyNasty&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt; as well. This should be of interest to open source advocates who pay so much attention to agreements and what they allow and don't allow. To me free expression on the Web is the real purpose of the Web, its purpose is not to make huge piles of money for venture capitalists or avoid lawsuits from companies that want to restrict free speech. That one of the richest companies on the Web could put a contractual throttle on free speech was horrible to me. That no one else seemed to care was even more horrible. "/>
				<outline text="At the same time, to give Netscape an incentive to work with us, we added all the features of RSS 0.90 to our XML format, to send them a signal that we felt that this was a competitive space, and to help ease a transition if they decided to work with us. I had already been in contact with them, but was told that RSS was a private Netscape-only format, not something they wanted to work with others on. I had my own opinion why they would do it this way, after a lengthy battle with Microsoft over standards in HTML, I could empathize. Which is more fun -- making software or fighting over standards? Making software, of course. "/>
				<outline text="So we went forward with My.UserLand built around RSS 0.90. Then one day I got a call from Eckart Walther, the manager of the developers working on RSS at Netscape. He told me that they were going to embrace our format, and come out with RSS 0.91 which was a merger of their format and ours. Of course I thanked him. A few days later they announced the new format and published their spec, they included some elements that even I considered questionable. However with one (important) exception, they embraced everything in our XML syndication format. "/>
				<outline text="I got email from people saying that it was weird to see UserLand's stuff on a Netscape site. They gave us a prominent link in DMOZ right after My.Netscape. They wanted people to know that there was a second aggregator. This is the true Internet culture, let's not be afraid to tell people that there are others are competing. Give people choice. Treat them like they have minds, let them make their decisions based on full information. And when there's compatibility, promote the hell out of it. That's the miracle, when there's agreement. It's even better when the agreement is about something that's as useful and easy as RSS 0.91 is."/>
				<outline text="Shortly after that I got an email from Eckart saying he was leaving Netscape. I think this, more than anything, explains why they embraced and supported our work. After the AOL acquisition, the RSS team at Netscape was on its way out. We were clearly commited to the future of the technology. I think they did the right thing, because over the next year, we worked tirelessly to help RSS become the strong standard that it is now."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="RSS after Netscape">
				<outline text="It was hard work to get all the elements of My.UserLand working. There were lots of dead-ends, things that didn't work that never saw the light of day. As it grew there were scaling issues. Many of the publications required technical help and help selling it to their management. UserLand took on that responsibility. We weren't always able to help, for sure, we're a very small company. But we stayed with RSS, and we stopped promoting our own format. This is a key point. Had there been no agreement with Netscape we would have continued evolving our own format. "/>
				<outline text="We put our energies behind RSS, even though I feel that RSS is imperfect at modeling Web content, its core philosophy is rooted in the model of print publications where there are articles with titles, descriptions and bodies. The Web, especially weblogs, has evolved a more free-form style. I wanted to try to solve this problem. I felt it could only happen if there was a group of developers and content engineers who wanted to do hard, cooperative and creative work to figure out what's really going on on the Web, and instead of forcing the content through a title-description bottleneck, figure out how to widen the pipe to offer more flexibility, yet still allow meaningful aggregation."/>
				<outline text="At the same time, XML-RPC was taking hold, I wanted to see if there were interesting ways the two technologies could be linked. I'm sure there are ways for this to happen, but again, it takes two (or more) to tango, and people didn't seem to want to work with us, so I was unclear how that could happen in the context of RSS. By July of this year, it seemed that RSS was frozen, and would stay that way until a group could form to take it forward."/>
				<outline text="While RSS wasn't everything I wanted, it had a lot to offer that I did want. I've been involved in the XML developer community for a few years, and worked with Microsoft and Developmentor on XML-RPC and SOAP, and in those experiences, I think many other XML technologists miss a key reason the technology hasn't caught on with average Web developers, people who are not theorists or scientifically trained, in other words, the vast majority of Web developers. It's too complex and fast-moving for Web developers to catch onto it. The XML frameworks are designed by programmers, very high IQ programmers, the cream of the cream, people with interest in mathematics, computer science, graph theory, database architectures. To stay current in the latest XML technology requires almost a full-time commitment to that. Many companies hire consultants to keep them informed on what's going on with XML. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="RSS is about simplicity">
				<outline text="RSS, in its simplicity, is a breath of fresh air. You can understand it fully in a few minutes. You can quickly deploy an application with just a basic understanding of HTML and a bit of experience in a scripting language like Perl, AppleScript or Python. That is the reason it gained traction, while most other XML formats are still in the working groups or waiting for deployment. In the overworked world of Web development, there's no time to study, there's only time to do."/>
				<outline text="To me, RSS is not just a syndication format, it's also a fork from the W3C process, a chance for XML to be widely adopted while the minds of the W3C working groups work out details of a network that will likely not be built. At this point there are even doubts in the minds of people who are commited to the W3C process. My views on this are well-known in the XML working groups and mail lists, and to our development partners. There's a respectful disagreement. And when such disagreements happen, both approaches should have a fair chance in the market."/>
				<outline text="I believe XML formats should be designed as end-user software is designed. Hack at the details, make every feature justify itself, reduce every three-step process to one if you can. Do it over and over, and then work on the top level. Then and only then does it get simple enough for ordinary people to use. I'm like Steve Jobs on this. I think when you lift the hood you should see a beautifully designed machine that invites you to understand and then use it."/>
				<outline text="If you want to work at the top of the pyramid, designing stuff that lots of people use, this is the price of admission. Roll up your sleeves and sweat the details. When you're done, the result you present to the users must be easy to understand and its power should be immediately evident. If you have to understand complex ideas before you even understand the purpose of a format, you lose most busy people, and your format doesn't catch on. "/>
				<outline text="Now, it's OK if others don't want to invest the effort doing this, but I feel I've already paid my dues. I've been making end-user software for 20 years. I want to make end-user level syndication formats that are transparently simple. Formats like RSS."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Let's get some help">
				<outline text="Some people have said that I have an unfair advantage, I can write, so my formats tend to be well explained. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, I work hard at explaining things. It's not easy to make complex things understandable. And second, instead of writing five hard to understand paragraphs, I allow myself to go back and change the software to make it possible to write one easy to understand paragraph."/>
				<outline text="So to me, as one of the parents of RSS, it's sad to see this courageous format be taken directly into the land of complexity. That's why this is such a big thing for me. To be fair, it should have a chance to prove itself. By an accident of history it has the name RSS. If we hadn't joined with Netscape in 1999 it probably would have a UserLand name. We never would have joined with Netscape if their format hadn't been a simple end-user-level format. We would have continued to develop and promote a format that matched our philosophy of simplicity."/>
				<outline text="I wish it had turned out this way, then the people who legitimately want to do a Namespaces-and-RDF syndication format would have to choose another name. To their credit, the water is muddied by the departure of Netscape from the process. So there's now an identity crisis, what is RSS, and who, if anyone, has the right to evolve it?"/>
				<outline text="I think the answer to this question is totally obvious. But as one of the parties to the dispute it's not up to me to say what it is. Let's get a mediator, or a small group of mediators, and ask them to read our essays, and let's agree to abide by their decision. Then, feeling that our points of view have had an adequate hearing, we can accept their decision. Even if we don't like it, chalk it up to an imperfect world, and go on. "/>
				<outline text="Or maybe there's a win-win, a way to gain exposure for both approaches, and for each way to gain more help from developers on the Internet. It could end up being a totally positive thing. Sometimes things work out that way, if we listen and develop trust, and respect each others' points of view."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What's ahead?">
				<outline text="It could turn out that the complexities I dislike so much are irrelevant. I've been wrong before. I thought desktop publishing was a dud. I thought Yahoo was a bad idea. I thought the Internet would route around the venture capitalists. "/>
				<outline text="Or maybe after a couple of years of separate evolution, we might join up again, lessons learned, and take the best of both approaches and form a new one that could work well into the decade. We don't know what's ahead of us. "/>
				<outline text="We also don't have a peer review or mediation process in Internet development. Perhaps this crossroad can serve as a catalyst for development of such a process. A group of technologists who are ready to mediate disputes fairly, thoughtfully and professionally, and dispassionately. Sometimes there's too much heat and passion, and a calm gentle hand can help get everyone back to work and out of each others' way."/>

				<outline text="I was responding to a post that said &quot;Downloading isn't going away completely.&quot; We're talking about music downloading, getting an MP3 file from the Internet and storing it on a local hard drive. One way to do this is through Napster, of course. The music industry favors streaming, not downloading. This presumably allows them to retain control of the music, in some way that's not too clear to me."/>
				<outline text="So here's my response."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's not just a river">
				<outline text="The mainframe guys in the early 80s said &quot;Personal computers aren't going to go away completely.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Of course, literally, they were right. Personal computers didn't go away. I guess it's also true that they didn't go away completely."/>
				<outline text="I heard a speech by Bill Clinton early this year where he quoted his daughter saying &quot;Dad, denial isn't just a river in Egypt.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Here's the message that the music industry appears to be in denial on. Your users want control. They've found out how wonderful it is when they can do what they want. Now find a place to fit in. The more lawsuits you file, the more headlines you grab, the more your relationship with your users is poisoned. The technology industry learned this lesson over copy protection, now you're part of the technology industry too. The lesson is that we exist to serve the users. When they ask for a feature, compete to give it to them. This means ripping up the rail every ten years and doing it all over again. Get used to it. This is not the end of the road, for sure."/>
				<outline text="I heard Sumner Redstone speak at the same conference I heard Clinton at. He said &quot;99 percent of the creative people in the world live within a hundred miles of my office.&quot; The thought that formed in my head was &quot;Off to the glue factory!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Users are creative too. Users can be revolutionary. You guys are like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timisoara.com/timisoara/rev/trialscript.html&quot;&gt;Ceausescu&lt;/a&gt; after the revolution in Rumania. Sitting in jail with his wife, he might have said &quot;The revolutionaries aren't going to go away completely.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="The rush to P2P has been breathtaking. In July I decided to throw in the towel and go for it. P2P all the way! The concept is close enough to something I've been beating the drum about for several years, the Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server. Let's integrate writing tools with Web servers. We've done it here at UserLand, the software in beta now and the results are as stunning as I hoped they would be."/>

As usual the reporter and the VCs are missing something important, technologically. "/>
				<outline text="Yes, Napster is a P2P product, largely because it puts both a client and server on the user's desktop. In the end when all this shakes out, that much will certainly be required of a P2P app. But I think there are other requirements. To be useful, it must also have an editor of some kind, an end-user editor, so people can easily share things &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; create. "/>

			<outline text="A P2P outliner">
				<outline text="I like to use an outliner, that's why Radio UserLand is built around an outliner. That's why it's good at doing weblogs, hierarchic Yahoo-like HTML directories, music playlists, scripts, pull-down menus. There are a lot of hierarchies on the Web, basically we've created a framework that makes it easy to map those hierarchies on the outliner, and we've provided a few plug-ins that implement some good ones. There's room for lots more."/>

			<outline text="A P2P spreadsheet">
				<outline text="But you could just as easily conceive a P2P product around a spreadsheet, then the interlinked documents would recalculate like a spreadsheet. I'd love to use a P2P spreadsheet, and with the right hooks, it wouldn't have to do all that Radio UserLand does, it could leverage off Radio UserLand through local interapplication hooks, through COM and Apple Events. It's now Y2K and machines run at 933 Mhz. We could start assuming the OS-level connections are fast. "/>
				<outline text="Making P2P work is like picking up seeds cast on the forest floor. It's an easy architecture to build now that our knowledge of networking is mature and the machines have gotten so big and fast, and we haven't (yet) forgotten how to make graphic user interface software. "/>
				<outline text="To think that all P2P software is Napster-like is to miss the point. I strongly believe (not a joke) that the P in P2P is people. Music is a great catalyst, it gets people talking, but it'll go a lot further than that. "/>

				<outline text="It hailed a new beginning for software, tossing out all the rules that came before. It promised that individual programmers would melt into a utopian whole, personalities would no longer be an issue, a ouija board would write the stuff, and people would come and go from projects, everyone happily working for free, the users would be empowered, Microsoft would be routed around. No more bugs, no more dictatorial leaders, and a swarm of Internet programmers working for free, would take Microsoft out of the browser business once and for all."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Did anything really change?">
				<outline text="Developing user-oriented software is hard work. Someone has to have a vision, and stay with it, for years, often many years, if the software is to achieve its goals. If the creator of a piece of software walks away from it, it usually dies. The people who are left to pick up the pieces have a hard job to do. It's like almost every other artform, you don't see too many new Rembrandt portraits or Beethoven symphonies in Y2K. Lotus 1-2-3 didn't go too far after Mitch Kapor quit, and it took 15 years for a fundamentally new version of the Mac OS to appear, and since the original creators are gone, it's quite different from the original."/>
				<outline text="But I'm gullible. Ask my friends. I fall for irony and sarcasm, sometimes even outright lies. So when the open source rage came along two years ago, I went on an investigation. I couldn't imagine how a software project could work if anyone could check-in any code they wanted. Even on commercial projects, ones where quality control is a central issue, we don't allow check-ins by new team members, every change has to be analyzed carefully because there are always weird interactions, and lots of rules you have to fully understand to move a program forward. Every bug fix could introduce more bugs. And of course they always do. That's why programmers pray to the Software God, Our Lord Murphy, the one who makes sure that anything that can go wrong, does."/>
				<outline text="In my investigation, I found that open source projects work like commercial ones. Check-ins are carefully controlled, and often new code is merely taken as a feature request in source code form. This is not different from how it works in our world, since we ship a lot of source with Frontier, very often people submit bug reports in the form of requested changes to our code. This is neither good nor bad. Often we can't tell why they wanted the change. But sometimes people do spot bugs because they have the source and we try to fix them when we can, again, balancing the changes against possible breakage, and in priority with other features and fixes that people are waiting for, and factoring-in where we want to go with the software."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Gravity is still here">
				<outline text="It would be great if just by changing a few rules that software could turn from a time-consuming and expensive process to a free and loving and always-wonderful process where everyone gets everything they want without waiting. But software is still software, it's still a difficult process to make great software. "/>
				<outline text="The Netscape source code was a mess when they released it, so the open source team started from scratch, which is not a tactic unique to open source, all programmers new to a project want to rewrite it. New code is simple. Code that's used by millions of people often is a convoluted impossible to understand mess."/>
				<outline text="We all make compromises. Even open source purists must run their software on chips that are just software that's not open source. Intel does not release their source code. It's even worse. Try to find the line between open source and commercial software on Windows and Macintosh, both of which have active open source development communities, and both support dynamic linking that allow runtime mixtures of different philosophies. Chasing this to its conclusion, and there's no way to find a line, the program counters of our CPUs cross in and out of opensourceland all the time, and we're no worse for it."/>
				<outline text="Most users don't care if the source is available. I am a programmer, if the code were available for the programs I use, I would never look at it. I'm busy. I have lots of other things to do. But users were intoxicated by the hype of open source. The promises sounded good. This undermined conscientious commercial developers, to be so vilified. When users demanded the source code, and we had to say no, they often punished us, so the hype hurt. I don't think this is well-appreciated. "/>
				<outline text="While the open source hype was targeted at Microsoft, the people who really got hurt were commercial developers who work hard to create software that people love. Of course the users got hurt too, because the developers of the software found it hard if not impossible to get investors interested in their software while the open source hype raged through the investment world. The open source hype added new barriers, just as the fortresses of the big commercial companies were crumbling. So sad that we couldn't have just let the freedom be, that people had to try to control it, monetize it, and stand in the way of people working together."/>
				<outline text="I did a survey of Scripting News readers and found that most of them want to work together, crossing the boundary between open source and commercial software. As I was trying to process the hype of open source, I incorrectly concluded that the philosophy of open source was against commercial software. This created a disconnect, people who do open source would say &quot;We think your stuff is cool&quot; but I couldn't reconcile that with the hype which seemed to say otherwise, quite strongly. I have finally reconciled it, the disconnect is between the leadership of open source, or the most vocal leadership, and the people who actually do the work, many of whom are moonlighting commercial developers, who like their jobs, and also like to do pro bono work. Duh. I wish I had figured that out earlier."/>
				<outline text="We're not as different as some would have you think. An open source project can only work if there's trust in a single leader, and if the leader stays with it. From that place, there's delegation, trust is distributed, but the source of trust must be identifiable. Someone's got to make the decisions, the arguing stops, movement happens. Otherwise there's fragmentation, and lots of unhappy people. This is exactly how it works in commercial projects. No difference."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday I read a story on Lotus.Com that reviewed Eric Raymond's Cathedral and the Bazaar, and said that his theories about management of open source projects are contradicted by actual practice in real-world open source projects. According to the Lotus article, there are no differences between the way open source projects are managed and any other kind of software project."/>
				<outline text="http://www.lotus.com/developers/devbase.nsf/articles/doc2000091200 "/>
				<outline text="So, if open source projects behave like all other software projects, is there actually such a thing as open source? You may be surprised to hear that I believe there is. But it's not in agreement with what the open source leaders say it is. I'm going to give you Dave's definition of open source, and you can see if you agree."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is open source?">
				<outline text="A program is said to be open source if the full source code for the program is available publicly, with no constraints on how it can be used."/>
				<outline text="That's it. We've looked at so many other possibilities, I've even discussed it publicly with Stallman, and he agrees that his philosophy is not open source, because there are constraints on what you can do with his code."/>
				<outline text="So, if this is what open source is, how long has it been going on? The answer -- a long time. Programmers are not the money-grubbers that some make us out to be. Most programmers want their creations to exist beyond their lives, both in space and time. We want to make things that people use, and we want respect, and mostly we want respect from our peers. Sometimes we release the source, and other times we don't. When we do, and when it's done unconditionally, that's open source."/>
				<outline text="Sometimes people distribute source to balance a similar kindness that they benefited from. In the mid-1970s I learned how to program reading the Unix source code from Bell Labs. To this day that experience influences the code that I write, and I've passed the lessons on to my team at UserLand and to people who learn to program using Frontier."/>
				<outline text="I learned to write software for the Apple II by reading Woz's code. Peter Norton taught me how to write IBM PC software, again by giving me code that works. Same on the Macintosh, and every other platform I've coded for, including the Web. The View Source command in the Web browser makes it virtually impossible to hide the secrets of the Web. You can always find out how something works. That's part of the magic of the Web."/>
				<outline text="Programming is a human endeavor, an artistic one, like writing or music. The art is in the process. What is this program? How do we decide which features to add? Who does it serve? Where should it run? Which bugs should we fix? Whether or not it makes money is often secondary to the purpose. The primary purpose is to make the world a little smarter, and to get the good feeling that comes from playing a part in that."/>
				<outline text="Free source code releases, or open source, are an essential part of being a programmer, and it dates back to the beginning of programming. It's not a new thing, and not complex. Basically the rule is, here's the source, have fun with it, if you want."/>
				<outline text="After the hype, the world is much as it was. Some have new fortunes, and new software is still being made, some of it commercial and some open source. That's as it is, and imho, as it should be."/>

				<outline text="It's time for something new. There's a lot of power on the PC desktop that isn't being used. As I browse the Web on my 933 Mhz PC, the graph on the Performance Monitor barely blips. My 70 gigabyte hard drive has tons of free space. How to use all that power? User interface.

				<outline text="Ray Ozzie, the lead developer of Lotus Notes, looks at a computer screen and sees a collaborative networked environment. "/>

				<outline text="Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, sees a page that links to other pages."/>
				<outline text="Susan Kare, who did the icons for the Mac and Windows, sees a blown-up bitmap that will look precious when viewed at a lower resolution."/>
				<outline text="Steve Wozniak, the developer of the Apple II, sees a disk controller pushing bits around with various rates of efficiency. "/>
				<outline text="Richard Stallman, the philosophic leader of the free source movement, sees an opportunity to route around monsters who want to steal his code."/>
				<outline text="Every creative person brings his or her two cents to defining what computers are, what they do, and how they do it. And if we respect each other, we can help each other. My rose colored glasses see something different from all these people, but I can help Ray, Marc, Tim, Susan, Steve and Richard realize their vision of the twinkle behind the screen."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The world is an outline">
				<outline text="When I look at a computer screen I see an outline. "/>
				<outline text="An idea I had hanging out in the doorway of my programming partner's cube in 1980 has turned into a career. I said &quot;I know how this *really* should work. Point at an idea, press a key and it expands to reveal detail. Do it again and it collapses.&quot; A simple idea that my professional life has been revolving around ever since. "/>
				<outline text="I've turned outliners into tools for authoring presentations, to browse or edit an object database, a schedule, web server, script, or menu bar. But now I'm swinging back all the way to the beginning, to the simplicity of my early products but doing outlining from an entirely new point of view. "/>
				<outline text="As with the HTML web, the key concept is linking. But the display is different. When you link from an outline &quot;node&quot; to another outline, the seam is invisible. When a reader double-clicks on the link, there's a slight delay while the other outline is loaded over the Internet, then it expands in-place, as if it were part of the same outline. In the same way that a click on a link in an HTML page shifts your context, we take you to a new place, but there's continuity in our environment that isn't there in the HTML web."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="OPML 1.0">
				<outline text="Outline Processor Markup Language, or OPML, is the format behind this new kind of Internet outliner."/>
				<outline text="It's an XML-based format, a three-screen spec that any HTML coder can understand in a quick read."/>
				<outline text="http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/opmlSpec"/>
				<outline text="&quot;The design goal is to have a transparently simple, self-documenting, extensible and human readable format that's capable of representing a wide variety of data that's easily browsed and edited.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="There's its mission and uniqueness. Unlike most XML-based formats, it's designed to be readable by ordinary human beings. It's simple because the idea is simple. As I've said in previous pieces, this is what most XML designs miss. If humans can't grok it, they won't write it, they might not even run it. Now it's hard work to refine and re-refine until a complex idea becomes simple, but that's the juice in user-oriented software, and in the formats we use to represent the users' work."/>
				<outline text="OPML is the native file format of Radio UserLand, our MORE-like outliner that understands the Internet. I'll be writing more about new things it does in coming pieces. The software is still in beta, a little rough for end-users, but totally ready for curious developers."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Who should care?">
				<outline text="Most Internet services can be modeled as hierarchies; music playlists, mailboxes, websites, todo lists, calendars, presentations, FTP sites, specifications and directories are a few examples. This essay is such a hierarchy."/>
				<outline text="If you're a developer of network services, and have struggled to create a user environment where people can edit structure, then OPML could be your solution. Wire up your hierarchies to OPML, it's easy, download a beta of the Radio UserLand software, open the URL, and start browsing. Look at the XML it generates. Link to another document. Double-click on the node. Look at the raw XML. You'll get it. If not, ask a question on the mail list or discussion group. Tell us about your service, and we'll figure out how it fits in."/>
				<outline text="Even if no one else cares, I do. If things go as I think they will, I will spend the rest of my career exploring applications for this format. It's that fertile."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Sharing ideas in a safe way">
				<outline text="This is a new idea, building a worldwide outline to parallel the HTML web. I don't think it's ever been implemented, or even dreamt of. However, I'm not going to patent the idea, because I want it to blossom. I feel we have enough technology and expertise to compete without a patent. Patents leave holes in marketplaces, they kill ideas, imho no creative person can support patents on software ideas. They are anti-Internet. "/>
				<outline text="Our new format is open, so anyone can create a competitive product and be compatible with ours. Even better, you can implement a network service that our outliner can browse and edit, and integrate with other hierarchies that we can edit. I don't want to create barriers, I want competition and compatibility and growth, growth I can participate in, and that means having an open XML-based file format, with a trademarked name."/>
				<outline text="Names come to mean something, having those names diluted is not good for the creative process, it can create confusion and stop forward motion, and penalizes generosity. There's a limit to how open one can be. "/>
				<outline text="For example, I could write &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar 2.0&quot; but no one would buy it because I didn't write version 1.0. "/>
				<outline text="We must respect an authors' ability to finish a thought. One would think this is self-evident, that all people with a long-term investment in creativity would follow this rule, but I don't believe it works that way in real-world business. When money is involved, people don't always respect creativity. (Ask Courtney Love, Roger McGuinn, Prince or Chuck D.)"/>
				<outline text="So my advice to creative technology people who want to be able to continue their work, learn how trademark law works and use it. Trademarks are not like patents, they don't stop people from building on or improving on your work. However they do enforce a base level of fairplay, no one can say they created your creation. Where patents kill creative processes, trademarks are good for creativity. Use them."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Doug Engelbart">
				<outline text="Finally, a hat-tip to Doug Engelbart, the inventor of almost everything we do today in computers."/>
				<outline text="In the late 1970s, when I was doing my first outliner, a fellow grad student urged me to read Ted Nelson's landmark book, Dream Machines and Computer Lib. I did read it and saw that my newly-hatched ideas were being discussed, in the past tense -- describing the work Engelbart did on the Augment system, in the 1960s."/>
				<outline text="I asked my longtime friend Bernie DeKoven to make an introduction. I've never met Engelbart, even though I've been developing ideas he pioneered for 20+ years. I sent him an email last week offering to demo my Internet outliner, the crowning achievement of my career, and with all possible humility, something he could be proud of, perhaps in a similar way. Even if such a meeting doesn't take place, I want to be sure my gratitude is recorded. "/>
				<outline text="I am thankful that it was possible to build on Engelbart's ideas. If you want to get an idea of what can happen when people are generous, look at the career of Doug Engelbart, and all that was created around and upon his ideas."/>

				<outline text="I went to a meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icestandard.org/&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; working group on Tuesday. I'll have a full report on Scripting News probably sometime next week. It was a good meeting. A room full of people who understand content management and syndication. After going in different directions in 1998, we now seem to be headed in the same direction. I would have met with them earlier if the RSS community hadn't been locked up, now I regret not meeting with them earlier."/>
				<outline text="I wrote about two models for syndication &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/09/03/theDarkSideOfSyndication&quot;&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, one model based on distributing content, the other based on distributing links. I bet on the latter model, it follows the grain of the Web, and imho the other model follows the form dictated by print. I also wanted to support what I call &quot;amateur journalism,&quot; more on that later."/>
				<outline text="I think there will be good forward motion with the ICE group, we agree on the need for simplicity. A good group of people, powerful companies, professional and respectful and open to new ways of thinking. There was even some humor! Right on."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="SOAP rules">
				<outline text="In the last week I've seen three new companies with interesting products that are basing their future on SOAP. It's really happening. In the hype over P2P, this may be being overlooked. "/>
				<outline text="XML is getting mature, and the killer app for XML, clearly, is SOAP. Some have said that SOAP is just a formalization for CGIs. That's very true. The key word is formalization."/>
				<outline text="We can build a more useful Internet if we focus on building systems that cross all kinds of boundaries with ease. "/>
				<outline text="Everywhere you see a screen-scraping application, there's a SOAP app waiting to be developed. How to monetize it when there are no ads? Charge for the service."/>
				<outline text="At the same time, let me express my love for XML-RPC; SOAP's lightweight older brother, a Model-T of distributed computing. Yesterday I heard about a new JavaScript system that does its object serialization with XML-RPC. At a conference earlier this year, the CEO of a $70 million technology company hugged me. Their software system is based on XML-RPC and they like it. David Galbraith, chief architect at Moreover.Com, says it's magic, it's so simple. I've had the same experience, many times."/>
				<outline text="I can't tell you how satisfying it is, after many years of struggling with Apple over this technology, to see it take root in the market. Whether or not UserLand profits from it is not as important as the compatibility that's happening. Systems that expose interfaces through SOAP or XML-RPC offer more chances for compatibility, and partnerships that actually mean something for users and investors."/>
				<outline text="Looking back, the turning point for SOAP was IBM's implementation for Java. Lots of people use Java, and apparently there were serious limitations in RMI that SOAP doesn't have. "/>
				<outline text="Looking back even further, credit Microsoft, for having the guts to get behind the idea. To this day most of the gorillas of the software industry only want to work with each other. They're doing it the hard way. When gorillas team up with independent developers, sparks can fly. "/>
				<outline text="People with big company attitudes complain about guys like me, but instead of complaining, Microsoft embraced. As they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/apacheItWorked.gif&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; in Apache-Land, \&quot;It worked!\&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Halsey Minor">
				<outline text="Yesterday I met Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET, for the first time. It's surprising to me that if each of us sticks to our plans, we're going to be in the same market someday, in a compatible way."/>
				<outline text="I always think that disconnects are permanent. I have to remember to relax about that. The ICE meeting on Tuesday was more proof. If people keep their minds active and learn from all their experiences, me too, we eventually arrive at the right place, even if there are detours along the way. "/>
				<outline text="Halsey sent me a followup email, &quot;I feel like I just travelled back to 1995 when this 'industry' was more fun!&quot; Right on. I feel the same way. I sent him a pointer to Radio UserLand. We're going to meet again in a few weeks."/>
				<outline text="BTW, this is one of those times that I can't tell you what's up. It's happening more and more. For example, when we were working with Microsoft on SOAP, I said publicly that we were working with Microsoft, but I didn't say what we were working on. "/>
				<outline text="I have to respect their processes, and I'm also learning to do more of that with my own work. It would be great if everyone could always be open about what they're doing, but there's an imbalance if your competitors don't do it. "/>

				<outline text="Earlier this week I was asked to write a piece for Fortune explaining, from my point of view, what's going on in the technology industry in Y2K. (I spoke the piece into a voice recorder, for a half hour, they're going to edit it for a special feature where a few other people from Silicon Valley do the same thing.)"/>
				<outline text="I explained that the Internet is not what the dot-commers said it was. Strategies that gather people behind specific domains and put ads on their writing is not what the Internet is about. The ads don't generate enough value to justify the market caps for all the companies that IPO'd in the last few years. It had to collapse. "/>
				<outline text="Now where will the technology industry go? It's so obvious, back to technology. Who cares what we have to say? That's not our job. Our job is to supply technology. Did word processor vendors have a stake in what was said with their tools? Our systems have to work, the users come first, and we'll ask them to pay. If they do, we can have a technology industry. If not, we'll have to try something else."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, it occurred to me that now that the blush is off the rose, now the east coast business pubs are going to tear Silicon Valley a new orifice. We deserve it. However, we will have the last laugh. Highly produced and sanitized content is what they're good at. Delivering the truth is what the Internet is good at. Once we get over our latest attempt to centralize it, we'll be back on course, supporting the route-around that will create a new competitive environment for delivery of news, information, opinion and art."/>

			<outline text="CollabNet">
				<outline text="I have been mystified about the business model for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collab.net/&quot;&gt;CollabNet&lt;/a&gt;, but a few days ago I think I figured it out."/>
				<outline text="To understand what's going on, look at IBM and SOAP as a case study. With a relatively small investment in engineering resources, at the right moment, IBM was able to lock in SOAP 1.1 as a standard, which gives the distributed computing market a chance to grow right now. "/>
				<outline text="As I understand it, they just had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$683&quot;&gt;two engineers&lt;/a&gt; working skunkwork-style, in suburban NYC, for a few months. Then they backed the work, and did something a bit surprising, they contributed it to the Apache project, as open source."/>
				<outline text="In that, is the value in CollabNet. They are organizing the work of dozens of open source developers as employees, and then doing contract work for big companies like IBM. This could easily be a profitable business. And it gives the big companies a way to efficiently turn dollars into strategies. No one will begrudge CollabNet their profit. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/2/00; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The Paper">
				<outline text="A few days ago I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/p/paper.html&quot;&gt;The Paper&lt;/a&gt; on cable, starring Michael Keaton, Glenn Close, Marisa Tomei and Robert Duvall, about a trashy NY newspaper with more integrity than anyone thought they had."/>
				<outline text="A great story told by Duvall, which might have meaning for Web people. When he was young reporter covering the Olympics in Grenoble, at the end of the Olympics, a bunch of reporters went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate. More people joined the party. When the bill came it was $9,000. "/>
				<outline text="They went into a panic, arguing, trying to figure out who invited who, when an old man seated at a nearby table waved his hand to a waiter, asked for the bill, scribbled a picture on it, and handed it back to the waiter. The man was Pablo Picasso. (Of course a Picasso drawing was worth more than $9K.)"/>
				<outline text="Close asks what this has to do with her demand for a raise. He takes a deep breath and says, paraphrased in Dave-speak: &quot;We get to hang out with the rich people, but we don't make the money. We never have and we never will.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Another key line, from the lovable curmudgeon, played by Randy Quaid, goes something like this. &quot;Sure we're a trashy paper, we run 8-inch one-word headlines, we put pictures of severed bodies on the front page, but this is the first time we've run a story we knew wasn't true.&quot; That wakes up Glenn Close, the managing editor, and even though she has a bullet in her leg, she stops the presses, and they get it right."/>
				<outline text="And yes, at one point they do say &quot;Stop the presses.&quot; &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Money and the Web">
				<outline text="A lot of what you read on the Web is motivated by money."/>
				<outline text="In my humble opinion, many stories are known not to be true by the people who write them."/>
				<outline text="Here's how it works. An analyst goes to a meeting with a vendor, hears the pitch, asks questions, listens to the answers and forms an opinion. The vendor listens carefully to the tone of the questions the analyst asks. If they get a sense that the analyst wants to play ball, the question is popped."/>
				<outline text="&quot;Would you like to be on our advisory board?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Translated: &quot;Would you like some stock?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="The Chris Nolan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wirednews.com/news/business/0,1367,21355,00.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; at the SJ Merc opened the door for an industry-wide house-cleaning, which never took place. There are people who call themselves journalists and write stories that appear to be conflict-free, but are highly conflicted, and the conflicts are often not disclosed. "/>
				<outline text="To my readers, I have received these offers and so far, I've turned them down. On the other side, I've had analysts ask to be on UserLand's advisory board (we don't have one), and when I pressed them to explain what that meant, I was told that they get stock. Now, it's flattering to have stock that supposedly objective analysts want, but I didn't go for it. "/>
				<outline text="Refer back to the Duvall story. If you take the money is it inevitable that you'll write something, at some time, that you know is not true? Is this the line between commercialism and journalism?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I hope my interests well-known">
				<outline text="Along with a small number of CEOs (mostly in the weblog community), I write publicly on a daily basis, and accept some of the limitations of being a journalist. I keep my money in mutual funds and real estate, I don't make personal investments in the companies I write about. I own a lot of UserLand stock and some Critical Path stock that I got when a company I invested in in the late 80s was acquired by them. The mutual funds are blue chips, not tech stocks."/>
				<outline text="I'm not playing the stock market, I've got my interests out in the open, and relatively simple. When I point to something that UserLand is doing, I benefit if you think it's cool. I point to competitors when appropriate, but lately I've not been doing that when they don't reciprocate. (There's a conflict of interest, disclosed.)"/>
				<outline text="Oy such problems! If everyone were riding the Cluetrain, it would be easy. But it's not so, imho."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Cluetrain is two-way, again">
				<outline text="As long as I've been reading newspapers and magazines there has been a presumption of integrity on the journalists' side, and a presumption of lack of integrity on the vendors' side. I've always found this puzzling, probably because I practice a business that's more of an art, software development. "/>
				<outline text="Many years ago I realized that without integrity there is no software. &quot;You can't lie to the compiler.&quot; So I've sat out many hype balloons, even taken shots at them (to no avail) and gotten flamed for doing so, imho by people with a not-so-great appreciation for integrity."/>
				<outline text="If it's wrong for a journalist to take a bribe, it's equally wrong for a vendor to give one. Integrity matters. I think that's the clue of the Cluetrain. Again, it's a two-way thing. It's impossible to be a high integrity vendor in a world where journalists have sold out, and where other vendors don't play with integrity."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's even more complex">
				<outline text="Now, this may sound horribly complex, but it's even worse than it appears. As the CEO of a software company, I make bets on other company's strategies all the time. I generally write about the relationships. This is often to the detriment of my company, because it allows our competitors to form relationships with the same companies we form relationships with; and further it limits the companies we can partner with to companies that don't mind if the relationship is discussed publicly."/>
				<outline text="An example, in April, our primary ISP, Conxion, cut off UserLand when I criticized them on Scripting News, after years of gushing about their great service. When the service turned bad, something I promised I would watch for (they welcomed it at the time), I wrote about that too. "/>
				<outline text="I strongly believe if they had worked with us they would be offering better service to their customers now, but they chose to disconnect us, and that came at a very bad time for my company (even with the benefit of six months hindsight). We were getting ready for a user's conference, shipping a new product, and getting ready to announce SOAP 1.1 with Microsoft, IBM and Developmentor. As the Scripting News readers know, I got quite angry with Conxion's inattention to the problems. I haven't written about this in this column, until now."/>
				<outline text="Now I respect confidential information, but public information is another story wholly. Our users knew we were having problems because there were constant outages. There was no way to sweep it under the rug. I can't lie about it, when we lost our connection, their sites went off the air too."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The other side">
				<outline text="Now, this piece is certain to draw a response from Conxion. I want to show respect for their point of view, and also show that I listened to what they said."/>
				<outline text="Conxion said that the problems were with PacBell's service, not theirs; and that reliable service could not be delivered to the location we were operating out of. Further, they had been operating our line at a loss, and had discussed cancelling UserLand's service internally before the March-April outages. Conxion people pulled out all the stops to keep UserLand on the air while we switched ISPs."/>
				<outline text="And my counter-point. First, the people of Conxion *are* fantastic professionals. They accepted the decision of their CEO, but they also kept us on the air as we struggled to find a hosting service we could work with. Without that commitment to service, our users might have lost their connectivity for weeks or months. They were a total inspiration."/>
				<outline text="Our bandwidth requirements were going up, that much was clear from Conxion's view of UserLand. Between December, when the outages started, and March when we were going off the air regularly, we added thousands of new sites on our servers. What Conxion missed, imho, are the people. Each of those sites had editors and readers, people who depended on our service, as we depended on Conxion's. When they shut us down they were shutting down lots of sites that had no opinion about them."/>
				<outline text="Further, the way Conxion handled this raised questions about *my* integrity and that's totally not cool. Did they think they were buying praise from me? Nothing could be further from the truth. Yet they responded as if I had breached their trust. Hey, I was just telling the people what was going on, from my point of view, and that's all. When the service was great I said so. When the service was bad, I said that too. "/>
				<outline text="BTW, we switched to Exodus, and so far, everything's fine. But if it goes bad, we'll talk about it. When we signed on with them, I sent email to Ellen Hancock, their CEO, giving her a heads-up that this could happen. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Partners and customers">
				<outline text="If one company chooses to disclose its process publicly, as UserLand does, all companies they work with accept a similar choice. It's kind of viral. It's a change in the way we do business, brought about by the Web. "/>
				<outline text="With better communication between users and vendors, when our services fail, there's no place to hide, for anyone. There are lots of other examples. Apple is struggling with their fan sites about publishing information about upcoming products. There are no easy answers to these issues, but integrity must be the starting point."/>
				<outline text="Customers legitimately ask us to disclose our plans, it's in their interest that we do that, but it's not always in our interest. When we tell people what we're developing, we also tell our competitors. We could also be undermining our current products. And sometimes our priorities shift, so until a feature is released, we're totally unsure when or if it will ship. Yet this is what the customers demand to know."/>
				<outline text="So it's hard to stay direct and tell the exact truth. It's getting more difficult as the market shapes up. I can see where we've paid a price for what I see as integrity, it's something I am thinking about. The only way to do that, for me, is to write about it publicly. "/>

I've never seen anything like it. As a developer I've never cared about things like stock prices, and if the company ships a product that customers don't buy enough of, so what? Clearly there's a discernable process at Apple. I don't know the insider view of it, but I see a stream of products, that tells me that there are more coming, for sure."/>
				<outline text="In early 1996 I wrote a piece for Upside where I pretended I was the CEO of Apple (this was before Jobs came back) and outlined a comeback plan. There are some elements of my plan that Apple has been executing fantastically. They didn't buy a song, but they did produce the mass market machine I described, it's the iMac. They nuked CyberDog and OpenDoc as I would have, and cleared up the positioning, they make computers now, not system software, or anything else. "/>
				<outline text="http://davenet.userland.com/1996/01/08/gottabearetha"/>
				<outline text="On the other hand, Apple's developer story is &quot;Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia,&quot; and that's not enough. You need little trees, for new markets to develop, for a platform to thrive. And most important, in light of the stock collapse, they didn't smooth out the distribution problems, and they're tough, when you hit a bump, it shows up in the profits, quickly. The market doesn't understand this. "/>
				<outline text="Apple hit a glitch. It'll be easy to get back on track. If I played the stock market (I don't) I would buy AAPL now. If I were a developer (I am) I'd probe Apple to see if there's some new opportunity to invest in each other, based on support for each others' products. I've said it many times, my relationship, as a smallish developer, only works when I'm selling their hardware, and they're selling my software."/>
				<outline text="A question. Is there an independent developer mail list for the Macintosh? There used to be a few. Are they still there? Or should we start a new one at eGroups? I'd be willing to invest a few cycles in such a list."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="ebXML will not use SOAP">
				<outline text="An article in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sdtimes.com/news/015/story1.htm&quot;&gt;SD Times&lt;/a&gt; about ebXML said &quot;The SOAP architecture, in which Microsoft has played a leading role and which had been under consideration as a possible transport mechanism for the messages by the TRP group, was rejected as being too closed an architecture for the stated open and collaborative direction of the ebXML initiative. Instead, the ebXML initiative chose MIME-XML technology to wrap and send the message.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="This wasn't a surprising development. The goals of ebXML, as far as I can tell, are more complex than those of SOAP. Further, the things that ebXML does that SOAP doesn't, put it squarely against BizTalk and UDDI, the extras Microsoft and the B2B vendors are adding to SOAP. (That's probably what the &quot;too closed an architecture&quot; comment is about.)"/>
				<outline text="These are of no more concern to me than the things ebXML does. I am not a B2B technology vendor, and I'm happy to have compatibility with Microsoft's software at the SOAP level, for now; and I think that some parts of Microsoft will produce software that our stuff will connect to. "/>
				<outline text="I'm looking for a mass market, something like the Web browser was in 1994, but coming from &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of independent developers working together. I get excited when I hear that people like Philippe Kahn and Rohit Khare (and three other top-level developers who must remain nameless at this time) are building user-level products around SOAP, and nothing more than SOAP. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="SoapWare">
				<outline text="SOAP is a remote procedure calling protocol, as I see it, it's not doing the same things as ebXML. I'm sure their goals are noble, and the software and services they deliver will be useful, but I'm interested in the Internet as a creative environment, so I see SOAP differently. To me, it connects user-level tools into clouds of content. My vision is focused differently than the Dot-Net vision, and the (apparently competitive) ebXML vision."/>
				<outline text="It can be simple, just do the things we were doing with COM and Apple Events, but do it over the Internet. No lock-in. Happy users. And to open source developers, this can be a basis of friendship. HTTP packets don't know what kind of software sent them, or is processing them. IBM's SOAP implementation is open source. Let's get all the environments wired up and validated, and start building great reliable clouds for all the users who will soon be running SoapWare on their desktops.

			<outline text="#title &quot;Dinner with Doug Engelbart&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/6/00; 6:06:50 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Preramble">
				<outline text="Last night I had dinner with Doug Engelbart. I wish I hadn't waited so long to do this. Until this morning I didn't realize how much my career was a replay of his. We're still doing things he did in the 1960s, even after 20+ years of digging. He had a lot of good ideas for Radio UserLand and the World Outline. Not superficial ideas, but to-the-core, why aren't you doing this type stuff. I hope he gets really involved with what we're doing. The next step is to exchange demos. "/>
				<outline text="This morning I started work by writing, relatively free-form, about the experience of meeting and exchanging ideas with Engelbart. I don't want to over-edit it, it's a stream of thought that may not mean anything to you. Or it might. Bascally I think I met my new rabbi. Whatever. Not sure I trust myself here. Time will tell."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Ramble">
				<outline text="Engelbart thought I had worked at Apple, I told him I never worked at Apple. I did, after leaving Symantec, *want* to work at Apple. Jean-Louis Gassee told me I wouldn't like it. Later I realized he was right. But being at Apple meant your ideas had a chance of being supported by Apple. Bill Atkinson's ideas, for example, were well supported, to the detriment of independent developers. Was our work any less worthy than his? Well I'd argue our work had &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; value, because we stuck it out, and did successive versions, learned from our mistakes and did the hard work of evolution. It's relatively easy to ship a version 1.0, but once shipped you have to deal with something that's messy and difficult -- users. But it's worth doing if you want your software to be used."/>
				<outline text="Working together. That's the common goal, we both have it, and both tell stories of how hard it is to get through the gatekeepers to get to the users. He threw challenges at me to see if I was one of the gatekeepers. Over and over. I guess I passed the test. I kept saying all I want to do is create an environment where people work together. "/>
				<outline text="It's clear is that Engelbart has had a tough life. Eventually he got recognition, awards, grants, seminars about his accomplishments, but he hasn't gotten the thing he wants. I was distracted by all the recognition he got, I was jealous of it, scared of it. I asked if Augment is running anywhere, he said it is, he uses it every day. When I probed, I found that he had an engineer's depth of knowledge. It wasn't phony. I have nothing but admiration for this grey-haired man with a twinkle in his eye and the impatience of youth, wanting, waiting and waiting to see his vision revolutionize humanity. I told him that we would get there. I have no doubt that we will."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Working together">
				<outline text="Working together. Working together. That's the point. The software that I create, the software that Engelbart creates, is about working together. It's opposite of the walls that gatekeepers create. I hated what Apple did with Hypercard. I hated what Lotus did with Notes. I hate what every self-interested promoter does to see their often shallow ideas dominate all others. General Magic, Netscape, Sun (with Java) and now the open source promoters. I hate the engineers, esp the talented ones, who seek this kind of dominance. The purpose of networks of computers is to enable people to work together. Mastering the art of working together requires that you throw the concept of dominance out the window. Goodbye. I don't want to dominate you, I want to work with you. Big difference in attitude."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Outliners">
				<outline text="It may appear that the outliner approach is narrow, but I don't think it is. I think outliners mirror what's going on in our brains, they reflect the way we organize ideas, concepts and information. I told Engelbart that our success with outliners came with people who understood the process of thinking. Everyone thinks, but only a few are aware of how they do it. This requires a higher level of awareness. First we have to turn on their lights again, after a hiatus of quite a few years. Then I want to figure out how make the tool useful for people who aren't aware of their process, the way MORE did in the 80s, by sneaking it in, in the guise of a presentation program. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Closing ramble">
				<outline text="By the end of the evening we were done probing and explained our work. We did a map that translated the terms he uses to the terms I use. At almost every step in my story he said &quot;We did that too!&quot; -- and it included XML-RPC and SOAP. We do have some differences, while he loves the mouse (he invented it) he does not believe in GUIs. He thinks they're crude. I have to give this some thought. At one point I thought they were crude too, but I gave in, drank the Kool Aid and never looked back. It's possible that there's something I've missed as a result."/>
				<outline text="To Radio UserLand people, he understood nodetypes, and totally gets evolutionary software. It's the process of evolution that matters. If a system is rigid and can't change, you're stuck. This may seem obvious, but lots of software ships with no way to evolve. What happened with Hypercard, Notes and HTML? Why aren't they evolving? Why is Frontier?"/>

			<outline text="Drinking the Kool-Aid">
				<outline text="A few weeks ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/20/whatIsP2p&quot;&gt;What is P2P?&lt;/a&gt;, a light-hearted fun-poke at the latest euphoria to sweep Silicon Valley. As far as I was concerned, the jury was still out on whether or not there is any such thing as P2P. Now the jury is in, for me, I'm ready to apologize for drinking the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userland.com/whatIsKoolAid&quot;&gt;Kool-Aid&lt;/a&gt;, never should have done it, I should have stayed with my gut. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;I'm sorry I drank the Kool-Aid,&quot; say I."/>
				<outline text="Ask P2P what it is, you get a hedge. &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; it says. That's the truth, but you don't hear a lot of that in the hype. Eyes glaze over, arms wave, people talk excitedly about services that work better without P2P. You can fill a hall with that kind of talk. I've seen it done many times. "/>
				<outline text="Until I see a killer app for P2P, I'm from Missouri. I honestly don't expect to see one. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What about Napster?">
				<outline text="But Napster, that's a different story. There is something magical and real and wonderful about Napster. But what is it that's so great? Is it P2P? No, of course not. It's the music. I've said that before, but it bears repeating. It's the music. Repeat that 80,000 times."/>
				<outline text="The P2P part of Napster was necessary to provide a legal argument that Napster is just a community, and not what the RIAA says it is. Now Napster has stayed where it is, no new features, no open interfaces, nothing for a developer to latch onto. To keep my enthusiasm, I need more community, and for that, as a developer, I need hooks. However, until the legal cloud is gone, it's not likely to happen. "/>
				<outline text="So music on the Internet is a mess. It's being stomped to death in the courts. This summer it was wonderful to be able to get any music I wanted whenever I wanted it. But the euphoria is dying. It needed to be fed with musical and technological creativity, and that's not happening."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Coming back to earth">
				<outline text="P2P is not the next big thing, any more than Java, Go, Hypercard, General Magic, or OpenDoc were. Or artificial intelligence, intelligent agents, push technology or open source. Napster needed to be P2P to route around the music monopoly. That was a good idea. And putting a Web server on the desktop has always been a good idea. And we're still not, as an industry, dealing with the big issue of giving the users control over their work. "/>
				<outline text="Putting a Web server on the users' desktop is a good idea because it allows access to your information from your desktop when you're traveling. A Web server on the desktop also makes it easy to configure software using a Web browser, something people have grown comfortable with.

				<outline text="Further, the ability to get data out of the cloud and put it on a local hard disk is a good idea, because sometimes clouds, e.g. Yahoo, lose data. It would be great if local software could do something meaningful with this data.

				<outline text="Anyway I gotta push back. When I say I drank the P2P Kool-Aid, I was referring to the lethal kind, not the fun kind. I know what P2P really is, on October 16, 2000, it's a horde of believers pitching ideas at anyone who will listen, hoping that they can wish into existence a powerful euphoria and capture millions of dollars and recognition and happiness. &quot;P2P is for me,&quot; say the hungry developers and VCs."/>

				<outline text="Now of course this question makes me uncomfortable, and if Ed wants a genuine answer, he probably should ask Brent the question without me (Brent's boss) there, but I gave it some thought this morning, and realized that I have a story about this that I have not told in DaveNet. It goes like this."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="How much do you need?">
				<outline text="How much money do you need to feel secure?"/>
				<outline text="Ask this question in different parts of the world, and you'll get different answers. In a poor country like India, it might be $1 million. In poorer parts of the US, $3 million. In California where you can hardly throw a pot sticker into a crowd without hitting a billionaire, the answer might be $25 million. When I ask myself this question, that's roughly what my inner-being comes up with."/>
				<outline text="Of course it's a complete lie. ;-&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="How much can you spend?">
				<outline text="OK, indulge me, play a little game, dream of having your perfect amount of money. Now, in theory, you feel secure. How would you spend the money? "/>
				<outline text="I've played this game with dozens of people. First they say silly things, like buying bridges, airports, baseball teams, but then I ask, why do you have to own these things to enjoy them? Couldn't you just rent them for the times when you feel like playing with a bridge, airport or team? "/>
				<outline text="Then we get more practical, buying second houses, third cars, vacation homes, big things, that I wonder if most people would be comfortable actually maintaining. Three cars have to be registered three times a year. Your second home needs to be furnished and maintained, even when you're not there. "/>
				<outline text="You say you can hire people to do these things for you? Ahhh, then you spend a lot of your life dealing with employees. Is this happiness? It might not be as happy as you think."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The game continues">
				<outline text="Now what if we add a rule that says you can only buy things that you can actually use? That lets out the second home, and if you have two personal bedrooms, well you can only sleep in one at a time, so you can't have more than one, or one car. But you can have a *great* bedroom, and a great car. Now how much money could you actually spend?"/>
				<outline text="This rule makes the game fun. And try as hard as you can, one person can't actually spend all that much money with the constraint that you actually have to use what you buy."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's even worse than it appears">
				<outline text="OK, so when you come up with a number, the amount of money that you can spend in a year, the natural thing to do is to take the number of years you expect to live, and multiply the two numbers to come up with your magic number, the amount of money you need to feel secure. But this would also be a mistake because you have forgotten  interest."/>
				<outline text="Money sweats. Leave money alone and it becomes more money. This can be a problem if you want an excuse to require more money before you feel secure. But if you want to play the game you have to allow for interest, because you will be earning it, no matter what you do. (You could keep the money under your bed, in cash, but we specifically disallow this in the rules of the game, you can't be stupid, you can't throw money away in pursuit of security.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Transcendental Money">
				<outline text="Now I can define my term. Transcendental money is the amount of money required to transcend time. It makes just enough money to satisfy all your reasonable needs, wants and desires, but no more. You can do the math yourself, factor in the cost of living where you live, or want to live, it's just arithmetic to determine what your transcendental money number is."/>
				<outline text="Once you have your real number, the true nature of money reveals itself. No matter how much you have, you never feel secure. Sorry, I didn't make the rules, have a talk with your god, or your dog, or whoever you turn to for spiritual guidance. The unhappy ending for all of us is death, we all lose this game, there's no winning strategy, and no matter how much money you attain, you can never feel secure, unless you trust nothingness, because that's where we're all headed."/>
				<outline text="So money offers a chance, in its absence, to find a happier purpose to life. I believe that no matter how much money you have it can't bring you that secure &quot;I Will Exist Forever&quot; feeling that our hearts all feel we deserve."/>
				<outline text="Now, having no money certainly offers a chance to postpone living until you get the money. I've been there, done that, got the prize. But I've seen people with huge piles of money-sweating money who believe that if they just double their fortune they will feel truly secure. I can't help these people, but I can help people who are truly poor. "/>
				<outline text="Probe your dreams at a deeper level and see if you can't find a way to do the things you want to do with your life, even if you have no money. You can save yourself a lot of years, learning the old adage, money doesn't buy happiness."/>

				<outline text="As a member of the Baseball Religion, and a lifetime Mets fan, how could I stay in California when it's all happening in NY?"/>
				<outline text="I can't."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why is baseball so much fun?">
				<outline text="New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani did something funny and philosophical. At yesterday's baseball rally in Bryant Park, he put on a hat that had the logos of both teams.  Grroan. This is bad. Then he said so. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;This is what I call the coward's hat.&quot; Then he tossed away the Mets portion to reveal a Yankees cap, which he donned along with a Yankees jersey. "/>
				<outline text="OK, he's a Yankees fan. Now I know why I don't like him. But it's infinitely better than being ambivalent. In baseball, there's no fun in not loving some team and hating others."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Baseball is a primitive link">
				<outline text="The human species evolved around clans and loyalty and total one-sidedness. Evolution weeded out humans who didn't have a strong loyalty gene. But in the current configuration of our species, where within 24 hours you can be anywhere on the planet, it no longer makes sense to hate people based on affiliations or history.  Like it or not we all have to live together. We have big planetary-level problems to solve."/>
				<outline text="Baseball is a fun exception, a relaxing way to revert to our genetics, a simulation of our past, but we all must know that the world will go on even if the team we love loses. That's the Mets philosophy, we're steeped in love that's not conditional on defeating the other guys. The Mets in the early 1960s were very futuristic in that way. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Let's go to Israel">
				<outline text="Alex Cohen, a good friend, an American Jew like myself said that the Israelis and Palestinians are missing something important. They have to live with each other. There's no way around that. I've been listening to Palestinians. It seems they have the same values of intelligence, education and humor that Jews have. But when I was growing up in NY I was taught that Palestinians are bad violent nasty people. This was not a good thing to teach."/>
				<outline text="I recall with a tear in my eye what Shimon Peres said at Davos. &quot;Peace is hard work,&quot; he said. Part of the hardness is undoing the past, and the walls that were built to keep us from seeing the goodness in each other. How can you miss it in the Palestinians? They *are* good people. Just listen."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Open source">
				<outline text="Switching gears, I get pushback every time I write about open source on Scripting News. They ask Why do you hate open source? Why are you scared of open source? Why don't you stop writing about open source? Now there's a wall. There's some fear. My philosophy is, if it's safe to do so, to go right through the fear without hesitation. "/>
				<outline text="Let me tell you why I write about open source. Like the land of Israel, independent software developers like myself occupy a postage-stamp size of the market's consciousness. Most people are happy to use the stuff that comes from big companies like Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, etc. They figure this is the best stuff the industry creates. "/>
				<outline text="So it's hard to get people to listen when we say that we're making better software in some ways than the giant companies do. Most people can't hear it. Ask yourself if you believe it. How do you know we don't kick butt? Would you trust our software with your ideas? See what we're up against."/>
				<outline text="This is the same problem the open source people have, and most of them, like the Palestinians, are very thoughtful, fair, honest even humorous people. "/>
				<outline text="So think of small commercial developers as Israelis and the open source people as Palestinians. We have to share a capital, like it or not (the sooner the better). We're the small guys. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Microsoft and open source">
				<outline text="Now the open source guys like to take shots at Microsoft, this gets them press (for a while), they aim big, but long-term it's stupid. They must not know how deeply rooted Microsoft is. I have a better idea than some because I remember when Microsoft was smaller than Red Hat, twenty years ago, and I watched them build their network, and it's a big one. "/>
				<outline text="To take shots at Microsoft is as ridiculous as the Palestinians declaring war on the US, although you could hardly fault them for doing that. It would make a good headline, but it's hopeless. Remember the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citypaper.com/1999-09-13/rewind36.html&quot;&gt;The Mouse that Roared&lt;/a&gt;. The little guys won the war but that was just a movie. It doesn't happen like that in real life. It's not like the Mets in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accessatlanta.com/shared/sports/mlb/post/ws/1969.html&quot;&gt;1969 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. The Mets had the same number of players as the Baltimore Orioles, the team they beat."/>
				<outline text="It'll take twenty years of really aggressive cut-throat competition to displace Microsoft, and they're not stupid people and they don't want to be displaced. They have a lot more players than we do. A lot. And the Young Bill Gates was something to behold. As Lloyd Bentsen said to Dan Quayle, &quot;I knew Bill Gates, you're no Bill Gates.&quot; (Nor should you want to be.)"/>

				<outline text="I'm back from my trip to the East Coast of the US. There was a Scripting News dinner in NY on Wednesday night at Katz's Deli. Great food, total geekout. On Thursday I went to the World Series; on Friday on to Miami and yesterday, back home to the Bay Area."/>
				<outline text="In New York I spent the better part of two days brainstorming with Adam Curry, former MTV video jock, Internet advertising entrepreneur, and now a man obsessed with a vision that I'm beginning to understand. "/>
				<outline text="In this brief warmup piece I don't hope to capture the whole thing, but I want to talk about part of it."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Virtual Bandwidth">
				<outline text="Adam wants the Internet to be Everyman's broadcast medium, to route around TV and radio broadcast networks, with no compromise in quality. Now if this were easy, or the solution obvious, we'd already be doing it. But there's a big sticky problem in the way, the pipes don't seem big enough. "/>
				<outline text="Believe me, I know about that. I have a relatively slow DSL connection. If I download a multi-megabyte QuickTime movie, it can take five minutes for less than a minute's worth of video. So it's hardly ever worth it to me click on a video link."/>
				<outline text="That's because &quot;the last mile&quot; between my desktop and the high-speed Internet backbone is so slow. But what if we put another computer in the middle, one that's sitting next to my machine, on my desktop. Adam calls the distance between my PC and the middle-computer &quot;the last yard&quot;. If I had such a computer, running something like a mail server, I could simply order the network to deliver a video to me when I'm not using my line, and it could take its sweet time, while I'm doing other things like meeting and walking, eating and sleeping. The important point is this, while the last mile is very slow, that last yard is very very fast, and that's the secret idea."/>
				<outline text="An example. If you've been using Napster with a relatively slow line as I have, think how nice it would be if you could check off a set of twenty songs and know that they'd all be there on your hard drive in five hours while you run errands. No buttons to push, nothing to sit around waiting for. The last-yard computer does the nursing of the line while you can have fun and have a life."/>
				<outline text="If you mulitply the number of bits per second times the number of seconds you're not using your line you can get a lot of bits down the pipe. And that, both Adam and I believe, is the secret to turning the Internet into a super-satisfying broadband experience. A little software, some new protocols (maybe not very new) and we're there."/>
				<outline text="Adam has written more about this idea on his website:"/>
				<outline text="http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/broadband/"/>
				<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
				<outline text="PS: Congrats to Napster and Bertelsmann on their deal. Looks like there will be peace in MusicLand on the Internet. Now maybe we can create the technology to make it fun, interesting and creative, without fear of ending up in court."/>

				<outline text="Imho, the ideal election returns interface would be several windows open on the screen side-by-side, one for each of the major news outlets, looking something &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/nbcProjections.gif&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. The windows would refresh every minute or so, showing new states being called. A scrolling list of news stories. Kind of a dynamic weblog, refreshing every minute. Click on the state to get the current returns. This would be a good adjunct to the channel-flipping interface of years-gone-by."/>
				<outline text="This has been one of the most interesting campaigns in my experience. If it's a tight race, we'll get to explore new interfaces for Web-based information; it'll be interesting to see what the major news networks have come up with. This night is unique, a US national election's news flow is like a huge firehose, and hopefully this year the Web will play a role in making it understandable, for those who care."/>

			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="The Web did a fantastic job of covering the US presidential election yesterday. As I hoped there were maps and links, and mistakes and corrections and lots of smart people participating, sending me pointers which were aggregated on the Scripting News website."/>
				<outline text="But all that michegas didn't yield a decision. The most unsure election in the television age. First it was Gore's to lose, with the key &quot;battleground&quot; states -- Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- going to Gore, but then, wait, it's Bush's to lose and now, who knows who the next president of the United States will be? No one. We ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/theDayAfterSurvey&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of our readers early this morning, who have &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/whoWouldYouVoteFor&quot;&gt;self-declared&lt;/a&gt; to heavily favor Gore, and &quot;I don't know&quot; is now a popular answer to the &quot;Who will win?&quot; question."/>
				<outline text="It comes down to less than 2,000 votes in a single state, Florida; which is highly appropriate. Florida is neither a southern state or a northeastern state, or the virtual capital of Latin America. It's all those things. A recount is going to happen today, and we're going to keep our focus on covering the Web covering the election, and return to software development when this confusing and fascinating situation resolves itself."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/9/00; 9:24:06 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The Web played a role">
				<outline text="A shifting point of view in the US. It's coming over all forms of media. People debate that the Web played a role in this election, it did play a big role, but don't focus on the campaign, look at how information flowed from the vote counters in Florida to the strategists in the Gore campaign. The Florida vote-counting was on the Web, and it was more current than the information the TV networks had. On that basis, Gore justifiably withdrew his concession and our political system went into meltdown mode."/>
				<outline text="So many threads to follow. Other slim-margin states might do a recount and find that the other guy actually won. Then where will we be? People are asking to be able to vote again. If one person can change his or her vote, shouldn't we all be allowed to?"/>
				<outline text="What if Gore had made a concession speech? Where would we be then? How much re-evaluation can we do now? How many more steps before the whole thing unravels and people act on the realization that we've been electing actors ever since TV became the dominant medium?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Remember it's Y2K">
				<outline text="Also take a look at our willingness to buy into technology. Before Tuesday few questioned whether the statisticians could really predict the outcome of elections. We mistakenly focused all our Y2K attention on the Millenium Bug, and failed to see the social processes that were at work, that led to what is sure to be the last national election of the TV era. Next time we'll follow the vote in XML and run P2P apps that give us the tools to form our own opinions about who's winning. We almost got there this time."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Our Ouija board">
				<outline text="The exclusivity of information led to the cynicism that's causing the confusion. Our blind adherence to the validity of global decision-making by television has run its course. The parties have gotten so good at fighting for the center, all they need is a blank slate like Gore or Bush to project their null messages on. Fight for being nothing, and you end up with a broken electoral system. The journalists dumb it down for us. This is what you get. A perfectly balanced 50-50 split of the electorate. Our collective Ouija board is telling us that we're not asking ourselves any meaningful questions."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No choices">
				<outline text="Is Gore pro-choice? I can't tell. Would Bush try to make abortion illegal? He didn't say and as far as I can tell no one asked. Both favored the death penalty. Can either of them do anything about global warming? How do I vote against the death penalty? No choices. Footsy all over the place. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/11/09#correction&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt;.) "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Taking responsibility">
				<outline text="Emphatically, I do not want to change the US Constitution, leave the electoral system as-is. I feel strongly that if we go to a flat national election, not only do we avoid solving the problem, but we actually enhance the role of television. All that will matter will be Oprah and Letterman appearances. The money flows to the television networks, and our choices would be even more diminished."/>
				<outline text="We are already in the process of changing the way information flows. It's so clear that the Internet has changed things, but we're so cynical we don't necessarily want to see that. Now it should be clear that each of us has substantial power. We can use our minds. It's not over yet."/>
				<outline text="We must all get educated on technology, ask the numbers people hard questions, and insist on understanding. Every story has a technology angle. We have a right to know how the system works and not according to the bedtime stories we tell ourselves. "/>
				<outline text="Let's stop voting for good times or fuzzy math or lockboxes. The world isn't that safe. We've all behaved as children, now it's time to take responsibility for our country."/>

			<outline text="A survey">
				<outline text="Last night before signing off, I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/philosophicalSurveyQuestion&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News. "/>
				<outline text="I asked &quot;Could you accept a President who you hate with a passion?&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Four choices were offered."/>
				<outline text="1. &quot;Of course, I've done it before, and I can do it again."/>
				<outline text="2. &quot;Of course, think of all the fun we can have ridiculing him."/>
				<outline text="3. &quot;Of course, the worse he is the better. Just think of all the different candidates we'll have in 2004."/>
				<outline text="4. &quot;No way, I'd be miserable for four years, I'd probably have to leave the country or kill myself.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Only 7 percent of the people responding to the survey as of 6AM Pacific felt they had to win this one. 93 percent kept their sense of perspective and humor and chose one of the Of Courses."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Some perspective">
				<outline text="Like fans of a losing baseball team, like the Mets of Y2K, who I love, we all eventually have to accept things we can't stand. This is the best argument against partisanship. It's Murphy's Law combined with the Scripting News motto. Anything that can go wrong will, and it's even worse than it appears. "/>
				<outline text="Any Bush supporter who hates Gore, or vice versa, if you stop and think about it, will realize that we can survive this. The path we're headed down leads to civil war. This is serious stuff. Ask anyone who lives in a struggling democracy. Now ask yourself whether you really want to throw all our cards in the air. Now's the time to think."/>
				<outline text="We survived Kennedy, who had a slim plurality. We survived Johnson who escalated the Vietnam War. We survived Nixon who was a criminal, and Carter who was weak. Reagan was an actor; and Clinton, a charming but selfish child."/>
				<outline text="We will survive this too, if we keep a sense of perspective."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Pull back">
				<outline text="People who should know better push buttons that they never should. Love your country Jesse Jackson. Even Jimmy Carter gave what appears to be a partisan speech. Some things *are* sacred. The time for partisanship is past. The presidency is not so valuable that it's worth sacrificing our political system to attain it. "/>
				<outline text="Further, it's not at all clear who won the popular vote. There are still a few million votes to be counted. The popular vote is not done yet. And it wouldn't matter if one candidate won the presidency without winning the popular vote. The Constitution, which all US citizens live under, spells that out clearly. Apparently some voters don't understand that. This is an even more serious problem."/>
				<outline text="Today the NY Times said on its editorial page: &quot;The sad reality is that ballot disputes and imperfections are a feature of every election. It will poison the political atmosphere if presidential elections, in particular, come to be seen as merely a starting point for litigation.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I agree. Of course there must have been other usability problems, not just in West Palm Beach or Florida. I bet if we look, some of those favor Gore. But let's not look. Grace demands that we get ready to move forward, to close ranks behind a new leader after the Florida counting process is complete, whether he is Gore or Bush. "/>
				<outline text="That's why it's especially important that both Gore and Bush and their staffs stay above the unfortunate partisanship that is entering this process. We will need one of these men to be able to stand tall and say &quot;I will lead you now.&quot; To Bush and Gore, please, don't damage that, even if you won't do it for yourself or your family, do it for your country. We only have two potential Next Presidents. Pull back from the partisanship. "/>

				<outline text="PS: A programming analogy. We're in a critical section now, we need a semaphore that schedules partisanship until after the presidential choice is complete."/>

			<outline text="Disclosure">
				<outline text="I have not said how I voted in Tuesday's election, or even that I voted at all. I never urged anyone to vote. That was a conscious decision. In such a close election, I felt it was important to simply take responsibility for my own vote, and no one else's."/>
				<outline text="I voted for Gore. I am not a member of either major US party. I vote independently in each election. I've been watching the post-election process as carefully as I can, while doing my job, as I assume many of you have, as well."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Seeking an endpoint">
				<outline text="This afternoon I caught up on today's press conferences, both sides, and I see a serious problem. The Republican Party has said that it will abide by the results in Florida. If they lose after the recount is complete, late next week, they will concede. "/>
				<outline text="The Democrats, when asked the same question, repeatedly, refuse to commit. After enough recounts I'm concerned that the balance will switch to Gore. At that point the Democrats are likely to remind us of the commitment the Republicans made. This will be unfair, and as a modestly intelligent person, I know it."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why Gore?">
				<outline text="Unlike some, I have no strong feelings in favor of Gore. It would be all right with me if Bush was the next president. "/>
				<outline text="There's a lot to dislike about Gore. I am strongly opposed to his position on the death penalty. He's taken action against free speech on the Internet, at the same time raising substantial amounts of money in the technology industry. I thought his behavior during the debates exposed personal issues that are likely to be a problem if he is our President. "/>
				<outline text="And while I believe he has more honor than Clinton, my ego wants satisfaction for the hell the Democrats dragged us through during the Clinton scandals. However, I put that aside when making my decision, and went for Gore, because his positions more closely match mine than Bush's. With no enthusiasm, I chose the lesser of two evils."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Later it will be too late">
				<outline text="The Republicans have made a fair offer that I feel the Democrats can and should accept, for the sake of our country. Now it's time for the Democrats to repudiate the selfishness of Clinton. It's not all or nothing. Later it will be too late. "/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="The campaign continues">
				<outline text="As the partisanship gets more intense it's clear that the campaign of Y2K is still underway, even though the election has already happened. "/>
				<outline text="At times the story turns to the role of the media. It's kind of meta-media, media about media, you get a sense that they're balancing things, disclosing their role, but they leave out their most important conflict of interest. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Media and money">
				<outline text="The political system in the US is designed to flow huge amounts of money through the media companies. They have an interest in keeping the campaign going as long as possible. When we're all glued to the TV sets they're making more money. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Hiding the obvious">
				<outline text="Another role of the media has been to hide the real story. I've seen it reported in a single Associated Press article, it may of course have been reported elsewhere."/>
				<outline text="&quot;An error rate of 2 percent to 5 percent, believe it or not, is considered acceptable by most election officials, if the error is evenly distributed across all of the candidates.''"/>
				<outline text="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20001111/el/eln_recount_machines_2.html"/>
				<outline text="So, the challenge now is to devise a way to tally the vote so that errors are distributed evenly across all the candidates. If you want to improve the error rate, that would be great, I'll work with you on it, but we won't be able to improve that for the Y2K election, it's over and done. A lot of votes won't count. There's nothing we can do about this. (If you doubt this, ask a friend who took a few math courses in college.)"/>
				<outline text="If the TV networks wanted to help our country, they would repeat this over and over. Instead they repeatedly quote airheads and hypocrites saying &quot;Every vote must count.&quot; What they really mean is that the votes we want counted should count. This is disgusting and un-American."/>
				<outline text="The networks are run by smart people, no doubt about that. But they're not using their smartness to get to the heart of the real story. Our voting system is horribly outdated. That's the basic story. And one more thing, the candidates, also smart people, are artists at saying absolutely nothing. And the networks make enormous amounts of money from all that nothing-saying."/>

			<outline text="Want a revolution?">
				<outline text="If you want to truly change things, stop watching TV. That would be more powerful than our votes."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/15/00; 10:10:23 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Intro">
				<outline text="Clay Shirky is an Internet entrepreneur and venture capitalist at The Accelerator Group in NYC. He's also one of the leading thinkers in the new software artform called P2P. Like many others, he's uncomfortable with the phrase, but is coming to terms with it. "/>
				<outline text="Clay posted an essay on a mailing list I subscribe to, attempting to explain once and for all, what P2P is, and I think he did a wonderful job. I asked if I could run his comments through DaveNet and he said yes. "/>
				<outline text="So here's what Clay Shirky says about P2P."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Clay Shirky: What is P2P?">
				<outline text="After a year or so of attempting to describe the revolution in file sharing and related technologies, we have finally settled on a label for what's happening: peer-to-peer."/>
				<outline text="Somehow, though, this label hasn't clarified things. Taken literally, servers talking to one another are peer-to-peer. The game Doom is peer-to-peer. There are even people applying the label to email and telephones. Meanwhile, Napster, which jump-started the conversation, is not peer-to-peer in the strictest sense, because it uses a centralized server to store pointers and resolve addresses."/>
				<outline text="If we treat peer-to-peer as a literal definition for what is happening, then we have a phrase that describes Doom but not Napster, and suggests that Alexander Graham Bell is a peer-to-peer engineer but Shawn Fanning is not."/>
				<outline text="This literal approach to peer-to-peer is plainly not helping us understand what makes P2P important. Having computers act as peers on the internet is hardly novel, so the mere fact of peer-to-peer architecture can't possibly be the explanation for the recent changes in internet use."/>
				<outline text="What *has* changed is what the nodes of these P2P systems are -- internet-connected PCs, which had been formerly relegated to being nothing but clients -- and where these nodes are -- at the edges of the internet, cut off from the DNS system because they have no fixed IP address."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Resource-centric addressing">
				<outline text="P2P is a class of applications that takes advantage of resources -- storage, cycles, content, human presence -- available at the edges of the internet. Because accessing these decentralized resources means operating in an environment of unstable connectivity and unpredictable IP addresses, P2P nodes must operate outside the DNS system, and have significant or total autonomy from central servers."/>
				<outline text="That's it. That's what makes P2P distinctive."/>
				<outline text="Napster and ICQ and Freenet and AIMster and Popular Power and Groove are all leveraging previously unused resources, by tolerating and even working with the variable connectivity of the hundreds of millions of devices that have been connected to the edges of the internet in the last few years."/>
				</outline>

				<outline text="Up until 1994, the whole internet had one model of connectivity. Machines were assumed to be always on, always connected, and assigned permanent IP addresses. The DNS system was designed for this environment, where a change in IP address was assumed to be abnormal and rare, and could take days to propagate through the system."/>
				<outline text="With the invention of Mosaic, another model began to spread. To run a Web browser, a PC needed to be connected to the internet over a modem. This created a second class of connectivity, because PCs would enter and leave the network cloud frequently and unpredictably, and would have a different, possibly masked, IP address with each new session. This instability prevented PCs from having DNS entries, and therefore prevented PC users from hosting any data or net-facing applications locally."/>
				<outline text="For a few years, treating PCs as dumb but expensive clients worked well. PCs had never been designed to be part of the fabric of the internet, and in the early days of the Web, the toy hardware and operating systems of the average PC made it an adequate a life-support system for a browser, but good for little else."/>
				<outline text="Over time, though, as hardware and software improved, the unused resources that existed behind this veil of second class connectivity started to look like something worth getting at. At a conservative estimate, the world's net-connected PCs presently host an aggregate ten billion Mhz of processing power and ten thousand terabytes of storage, assuming only 100 million PCs among the net's 300 million users, and only a 100 Mhz chip and 100 Mb drive on the average PC."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The veil is drawn back">
				<outline text="The launch of ICQ in 1996 marked the first time those intermittantly connected PCs became directly addressable by average users. Faced with the challenge of establishing portable presence, ICQ bypassed DNS in favor of creating its own directory of protocol-specific addresses that could update IP addresses in real time, a trick followed by Groove, Napster, and NetMeeting as well. (Not all P2P systems use this trick. Gnutella and Freenet, for example, bypass DNS the old fashioned way, by relying on numeric IP addresses. Popular Power and SETI\@Home bypass it by giving the nodes scheduled times to contact fixed addresses, thus delivering their current IP address at the time of the connection.)"/>
				<outline text="Whois counts 23 million domain names, built up in the 16 years since the inception of IP addresses, in 1984. Napster alone has created more than 23 million non-DNS addresses in 16 months, and when you add in all the non-DNS Instant Messaging addresses, the number of P2P addresses designed to reach dynamic IPs tops 200 million. Even if you assume that the average DNS host has 10 additional addresses of the form foo.host.com, the total number of P2P addresses now equals the total number of DNS addresses after only 4 years, and is growing faster than the DNS universe today."/>
				<outline text="As new kinds of net-connected devices like DVRs and wireless PDAs proliferate, they will doubtless become an important part of the internet as well, but for now PCs make up the enormous preponderance of these untapped resources. PCs are the dark matter of the internet, and their underused resources are fueling P2P."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Litmus tests">
				<outline text="If you're looking for a litmus test for P2P, this is it: 1) Does it treat variable connectivity and temporary network addresses as the norm and, 2) does it give the nodes at the edges of the network significant autonomy?"/>
				<outline text="If the answer to both of those questions is yes, the application is P2P. If the answer to either question is no, it's not P2P."/>
				<outline text="Another way to examine this distinction is to think about ownership. The is less about &quot;Can the nodes speak to one another?&quot; and more about &quot;Who owns the hardware that the service runs on?&quot; The huge preponderance of the hardware that makes Yahoo work is owned by the Yahoo and managed in Santa Clara. The huge proponderance of the hardware that makes Napster work is owned by Napster users and managed on tens of millions of individual desktops. P2P is a way of decentralizing not just features, but costs and administration as well. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Who's whom?">
				<outline text="Napster is P2P, because the addresses of Naspter nodes bypass the DNS system, and because once the Napster server resolves the IP addresses of the PCs hosting a particular song, it shifts control of the file transfers to the nodes. Furthermore, the ability of the Napster nodes to host the songs without central intervention lets Napster users get access to several terabytes of storage and bandwidth at no additional cost. "/>
				<outline text="However, Intel's &quot;server peer-to-peer&quot; is not P2P, because servers have always been peers. Their fixed IP addresses and permanent connections present no new problems, and calling what they already do &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; presents no new solutions. "/>
				<outline text="ICQ and Jabber are P2P, because not only do they devolve connection management to the individual nodes once they resolve the addresses, they violate the machine-centric worldview encoded in the DNS system. Your address has nothing to do with the DNS systems, or even with a particular machine, except temporarily -- your chat address travels with you. Furthermore, by mapping 'presence' -- whether you are at your computer at any given moment in time -- chat turns the old idea of permanent connectivity and IP addresses on its head. Chat is an important protocol *because* of the transience of the connectivity. "/>
				<outline text="Email, which treats variable connectivity as the norm, is nevertheless not P2P, because your address is not machine independent. If you drop AOL in favor of another ISP, your AOL email address disappears as well, because it hangs off DNS. Interestingly, in the early days of the internet, there was a suggestion to make the part of the email address before the @ globally unique, linking email to a person rather than to a person\@machine. That would have been P2P in the current sense, but it was rejected in favor of a machine-centric view of the internet. "/>
				<outline text="Popular Power is P2P, because the distributed clients that contact the server need no fixed IP address and have a high degree of autonomy in performing and reporting their calculations, and can even be offline for long stretches while still doing work for the Popular Power network. "/>
				<outline text="Dynamic DNS is not P2P, because it tries to retrofit PCs into the traditional DNS system, and so on. "/>
				<outline text="This list of resources which current P2P systems take advantage of -- storage, cycles, content, presence -- is not necessarily complete. If there were some application which needed 30,000 separate video cards, or microphones, or speakers, a P2P system could be designed that used those resources as well. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="P2P is a horseless carriage">
				<outline text="Whenever something new seems to be happening on the internet, there is a push to define it, and as with the &quot;horseless&quot; carriage or the &quot;compact&quot; disc, new technologies are often labelled according to some simple difference from what came before -- horsedrawn carriages, non-compact records. "/>
				<outline text="Calling this new class of applications peer-to-peer emphasizes their difference from the dominant client/server model. However, like the horselessness of the carriage or the compactness of the disc, the &quot;peeriness&quot; of P2P is more a label than a definition.  "/>
				<outline text="As we've learned from the history of the internet, adoption is a better predictor of software longevity than perfection is, and as the P2P movement matures, users will not adopt applications that embrace decentralization for decentralization's sake. Instead, they will adopt those applications which use just enough decentralization, in just the right way, to create novel functions or improve existing ones. "/>

The incubators have been about brands and markets, product concepts, applications. Instead they should have been about technology. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Backplanes">
				<outline text="I was one of the founders of Symantec, a company started in the 1980s, with incubation and bootstrapping in mind. Our plan was to grow via mergers and acquisitions, to create an environment where technologists would be happy, and would create new wonders and utility that would be commercialized by a shared sales and marketing organization. This was a solid idea, and pretty close to the incubation model that became popular later."/>
				<outline text="However it didn't boot up as planned because when the companies merged, they didn't have compatible interfaces. This was true at all levels. The products didn't work together. And the companies weren't started to be merged. If we had known we were going to merge we would have done things differently. Very differently."/>
				<outline text="When I left Symantec I was determined to solve the problems at a technologic and human level, so that a &quot;backplane&quot; like Symantec could work. There were detours along the way, the Mac market went kaput, and then the Internet, a blessing, because it simplified the role of the backplane, came along and ripped up the whole road. But we've now put it back together, and networking, the missing piece of the 80s and 90s is in place. That's what the XML-based formats are all about."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A bigger bootstrap">
				<outline text="Let's find a way to start lots of standalone companies, fund lots of independent-thinking developers with a twinkle in the eye, it's so cheap, but let's give them standards to work with. Let's make it so that when the companies merge, the services plug together, and work. Based on many years in this industry, I think this feature would please the VC mind. The mergers they conceive would be implementable, they'd work."/>
				<outline text="But this would also be a corner-turn for the VC industry, because, as it's now structured, they funnel tens or hundreds of millions of dollars through a relatively small number of companies. However an opportunistic VC would have an incubator (call it something else if you want) that flows much smaller amounts of money to the bright eyes, without much fuss and not many strings attached, while we figure out how to get a few backplane companies going.

				<outline text="PS: Bootstrap is an ancient computer science term. When you turn on a computer it bootstraps, or &quot;boots.&quot; First it loads the most ancient bit of code, probably written in the 1970s. It runs a program written in the 80s, which in turn launches a program written in the 90s. Each of the levels loads only for the purpose of loading the next bit of history. Doug Engelbart was the first to use the term in the context of this piece, as far as I know. All engineers bootstrap all the time. To understand bootstrapping is to understand software, imho.

				<outline text="BTW, I also like The Economist for the same reasons, with the added benefit of a European point of view."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Content management">
				<outline text="Content management was a big topic in New Orleans. A subject near and dear to my heart. Lots of discussion, out of which came some advice for people deploying new websites for their organizations."/>
				<outline text="Get the basic stuff working first. Don't wait. So many startups in stealth mode never get their sites on their air before spending all their investors' money. Start by starting. If you want to learn, jump in and swim. So much talk about icing the cake, people talk about the benefits of a managed website, but before you can get the benefits you have to get a website on the air. As many have found it's not as easy as it looks."/>
				<outline text="Start with a simple editing system where writers can write simple email-style messages that flow through templates. Then add a home page with links to a few static pages, and a center stage that changes every day with links to new stories. Add a searchable archive. Then a hierarchic directory. Get this all working, and then and only then should you consider adding a store or personalization features."/>
				<outline text="Bootstrapping is not just for developers, it's for users too."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Avoid lock-in">
				<outline text="One more bit of advice. Ask all your vendors to explain how they're locking you in to their software. Know up front what your choices are in the future. The more lock-in the less powerful you will be. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's good for me">
				<outline text="Going to conferences is good for me. I get lots of ideas and meet new people and their points of view make my point of view broader."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A big ramble">
				<outline text="Sunday on 60 Minutes, the opening segment was on the dotcoms. Their thesis -- there may be no way to make money on the Internet. Very Zenlike. Everyone goes nuts about how much money everyone will make on the Internet. Some do make money, not on the Internet itself, but on the hype. When the hype dies, what's left? Just us squirrels. Is there any way to make money to pay for the writers, designers, graphics people and programmers? Hmmm. "/>
				<outline text="Now, what do we want the Internet to be? I'm thinking (again) that it's time for a new conference. As the &quot;business models&quot; fade away, let's return to technology. There's still a lot of work to do. The Web browser got lost inside Microsoft, tied to their mission (don't threaten Word). I read in Joel Spolsky's new book that Excel wasn't used for spreadsheets, it was used for lists. That's why Improv didn't have the impact everyone thought it would. (Remember Improv?) So let's make great list tools. (I have a few ideas about that.) I hear that Groove's killer app is file sharing. It really works, no sysadmins to screw it up. That makes sense. (Remember mainframes?) If I were going to run a conference (still thinking about it) the common thread would be What Really Works? and then How Can It Work Better?"/>
				<outline text="Look at our track record as an industry. Take the prosaic explanation for every revolution that happened, and take note of every supposed revolution that never did happen. The Web &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a revolution. But was it really that different? It marked the maturation of networking, the commercialization of networking. Anyone with a mind in the 60s, 70s and 80s could see it coming, and many did. (In fact the innovations of previous decades were necessary to make it work.)"/>
				<outline text="Another common track -- no one wants to challenge Microsoft in desktop apps, even where Microsoft has no software. This is wrong. You don't have to beat Microsoft to have a successful product. Even a niche in one of the Microsoft-dominated categories could be an excellent market. I suggested to Dan Greening of Macromedia a long-time pet idea of mine. I want a Flash word processor. The editor renders in Flash. It's wizzy. It saves in Flash. Since the Flash runtime is so widely deployed there should be no problem rendering the text for the reader. Flash text looks so much better than Microsoft text. This is a no-brainer. Let's do it."/>
				<outline text="In James Tauber (Bowstreet CTO)'s keynote on Web Services on Saturday, the question of Why SOAP? (and not CORBA) came up. Simple answer. SOAP is inclusive and CORBA is Unix. SOAP came from the best practices of Mac and Windows, adapted to the standards of the Internet. Therefore it includes users of all popular platforms, including Unix. CORBA did not embrace the popular platforms. Other than simplicity -- a SOAP implementation takes a fraction of the time of a CORBA implementation -- that's the real difference between the two. If you have a killer idea, it won't go anywhere unless you factor in the inevitable route-around, at the beginning. That goes for Unix too. Lock-in is death, it's not a viable business model. See the bit about making money on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="BTW, it's a little bit of a trick. I think (hope) that there are still ways to make money, but the Internet part of what we do is not the way."/>
				<outline text="I'd also like to talk about Users Taking Responsibility. If you use computers the state of the technology industry must be disturbing, if you're thinking. If your vendors are delivering what you want, I imagine you're in a small minority. What would it take to get a new industry in place that wasn't selling airbags, but was focused on giving you and &lt;i&gt;your users&lt;/i&gt; what you want. "/>
				<outline text="So there's my conference outline. When you hit bottom it's time to start planning for the future. All bets are off. Time to make some new ones, and in doing so, perhaps learn from the lessons of loops gone by."/>
				<outline text="Have fun and Happy Holidays!"/>

				<outline text="I think it would be great if Gore got a cherry job in the new administration, like being the person responsible for the overhaul of the election process, so in 2004 we have ATM-like computers in every precinct, paid for by the US government.

				<outline text="In the NY Times they say he took a bullet for us. I think it's a good metaphor. He could have kept fighting, and it would have hurt all of us. It takes patriotism to put your own interests aside and let it go. This is something Clinton wouldn't do. Thanks Al. "/>

			<outline text="Selfish people">
				<outline text="In the meantime there are some horribly selfish people floating around the US. Or so it seems to me. The same people who used Nazi imagery to describe Republicans, they still have something to say, and I would love to know what it is, because nothing is as black and white as they say. "/>
				<outline text="If you think the US Supreme Court took the easy way out (I do, but I also think they did the best they could), remember that the Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court had some harsh words for his colleagues, all of whom were appointed by Democrats.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/21/00; 7:33:58 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Winding and looming">
				<outline text="As Y2K winds down and Y2K++ looms large, let's do some looking back and forward."/>
				<outline text="The Year 2000 was a tough one in the Internet software business. It was the year the bubble burst, and lots of pre-bubble services went offline this year, and more are sure to pop in 2001."/>
				<outline text="Hanging out with a group of software entrepreneurs a few days ago, someone said &quot;None of us are making money.&quot; It's true. But we're all thinking about it now, even companies with hoards of cash raised before the crash. Maybe this will unlock creativity, and people will look for ways to make their software and systems work together. Every time we've gotten to this place (I think I've been around this loop before) that's what would have made the difference. Don't only look up for validation, look to the side and down for people whose visions fit with yours and are willing to work hard to make it work. Don't be picky about who you work with. And be from Missouri, look for beef, avoid &quot;business models&quot; and hype-based business plans. This advice would have served IBM in the 80s, Apple and Microsoft in the 90s, and today's Internet development world."/>
				<outline text="Again, it's really about the users. What do they want us to create for them? Perhaps 2001 will be the year when users look at the big picture and help their favorite developers get profitable. We like to talk about technologists having vision, but if users don't have vision too, then there's no way to win. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Specific technologies">
				<outline text="Y2K was the year &quot;SOAP&quot; came on the scene. &quot;XML-RPC&quot; continued growing. In New Orleans I gave a keynote on distributed computing via XML, and the audience need absolutely no selling. These guys weren't sitting on the edge looking scared as so many did in 1998 and 1999. They were in the pool, swimming, starting to make waves. "/>
				<outline text="When we check back with them in late 2001, there will be Web services everywhere, and developers will be able to migrate to any development environment they want to. This is why so much of the focus on Microsoft is incorrect. &lt;i&gt;The purpose of SOAP is to take the focus off Microsoft. &lt;/i&gt;Read that sentence 23 times until it sinks in. It's Zen-like and deep."/>
				<outline text="We did not resolve the mess with &quot;RSS&quot; this year. Yet we still want to move it forward. There's a reason we did RSS, it wasn't an idle exercise. Our software needs an easy syndication format. That's RSS. Expect movement here soon. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="P2P">
				<outline text="I could sell anyone with a mind on P2P. The user benefits will be substantial if not enormous. The users' data must be available to the user, yet we want the benefit of mobility. We want control. Will P2P be easy? Yes, if you like Mind Bombs. The server will show up on your machine and will be easy to use. Huh?"/>
				<outline text="P2P is not just hype. Using cycles on users' machines to make software work better is high on my todo list for 2001. We'll ship software for Radio before the end of Y2K that works in the P2P way, and Murphy-willing we'll develop in that model through 2001."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Roots rocked">
				<outline text="Yet there are problems, we're so confused, so much change. We used to know the people at Microsoft who do the Mac browser. We desperately need a fix from them, but they don't get it. "/>
				<outline text="If you work at Microsoft, if you want Mac users to be able to participate in the revolution, make it so that MSIE works fast with a server running on the same machine as the browser. This is the sweet spot, it works great on Windows, not at all on Mac. "/>
				<outline text="It's still up to developers to make it work. Today I don't use a Mac myself, all my software runs on Windows, and that's what I use. But I care about Macs. It's the user thing again. I don't insist they stop using Macs even though I like Windows 2000. I don't wish the Mac would go away, I wish the opposite."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="User interface">
				<outline text="Y2K was a year of development at UserLand. We turned to user interface, as we did in 1999, but this time, instead of focusing on the browser as a writing environment, a problem well-explored now, we returned to the desktop. "/>
				<outline text="In 2001 the Internet will be revealed in a new light, using the power of your computer, and the power of your mind. If you like to use computers and minds, stay tuned, because the Internet will have a lot more to offer in 2001."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Finding balance">
				<outline text="Finally, to &quot;Scripting News&quot; people, thank you. We learned a lot together this year. Thank you for sharing what you know and what you create. This is a unique environment, more and more two-way, even though we need filters to keep on the high road. Being open to everything is not a safe thing to do if you want to explore provocative subjects. But we found a balance that works. Thanks for your patience."/>

				<outline text="PS: I extended an olive branch privately to O'Reilly, and they did the same.

			<outline text="#title &quot;A Brief User Interface Manifesto&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/22/00; 8:32:33 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Joel's book">
				<outline text="I had the honor to write the foreword for Joel Spolsky's upcoming book on user interface design for programmers. I am happy to help spread the word that user-centered software design is an important but largely lost artform. Excerpts from Joel's book are here:"/>
				<outline text="http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$51"/>
				<outline text="Highly recommended reading, great stuff to think about between movies, football games and big turkey dinners. "/>
				<outline text="Now here's my manifesto.."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A brief manifesto">
				<outline text="I remember, as if it were yesterday, my first experience with a user. I had been developing a software product for three years, all the while thinking it was easy to use. A friend who had been listening to me gush about how great it was asked if he could try it. Hesitantly I said yes. I launched the program and we switched seats. I tried to say nothing as he wondered what to do. The software didn't have anything to say. &quot;What should I do?&quot; he asked. I thought to myself &quot;I have some work to do.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="This is the moment of truth for any software developer, and one we avoid. In The Soul of a New Machine, Tracy Kidder tells about the first problem report from &quot;the field&quot; about a computer system developed at Data General in the late 1970s. The lead developer was surprised. In his mind the computer was a development project; that real people would try to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it attacked his perception of his own product. "/>
				<outline text="We all go through this, at a superficial level we think we're designing for users, but no matter how hard we try, we're designing for who we think the user is, and that means, sadly, that we're designing for ourselves. Until you prove that it's usable by other people, your software is certainly &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; designed for them. "/>
				<outline text="Until you make the shift and let the users tell you how your software works, it simply can't be usable. Every successful software product is proof of this, as is every failure. How many times have you installed some software or visited a Web site and wondered &quot;What does this do?&quot; Now, understand that other people are asking the same question about your software. It's a puzzle, to solve it you must figure out how to get your software into a user's mind, and to learn how to do that, you must learn how that mind works."/>
				<outline text="Joel's book is a milestone built on a strong foundation of practical experience. He's absolutely right that user testing is easy. You don't need a lab to do it, although many people think you do. You just need a computer and a person who doesn't know your software. It's an iterative process. Do it once, it'll change your whole perspective. Do some engineering. Do it again with a new person. Repeat the process until the first-time user knows what to do, and actually can use the software to do what it was designed to do."/>
				<outline text="Joel's book is about more than software design and user-centricity. Once you learn how to communicate with users through software, it's inevitable that all your communication will improve. The central aha is to realize that other people use your software, and they don't know what you know, and they don't think like you think they do. "/>
				<outline text="There are some very simple truths in this book, and sometimes the simplest truths can be most difficult. But Joel makes it so easy! His stories are clear and human and fun. And that may be the biggest lesson, if you haven't been designing for users, you're not having as much fun doing software as you could."/>
				<outline text="I can tell you, from personal experience, that there's nothing more satisfying as a professional software developer than to have a product resonate with the market, to have thousands of people tell you that they couldn't work without your software. To get there, you have to learn from them as you teach. Yes, your software is great, I believe you, but if no one uses it, it can't make the world a better place."/>
