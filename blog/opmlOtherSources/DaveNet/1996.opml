			<outline text="#title &quot;Going For It&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/1/96; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning and..."/>
			<outline text="Happy New Year!"/>
			<outline text="I'm on the eastern edge of the Pacific Rim, one of the last places on the planet to turn the calendar. As I write this late on 12/31/95 it's already 1996 in most of the world. So this may not be the first email you receive in the new year, but it definitely is the first one I sent."/>
			<outline text="It's been a very long exciting weekend. I never write this late in the day. It's a night-time DaveNet. Wierd! It's kind of an airy piece, not too angry or funny. Who can be humorous this late in the day? I'm a morning person, exploring new territory by trying to get something meaningful done in the waning hours of a day. Never mind the waning hours of a whole year! Wow."/>
			<outline text="It's a new year. Coooool. A new beginning. A chance to reset our expectations, to ask more from life, more from the world. We can also offer more to the world. And more to ourselves."/>
			<outline text="We can turn corners. We can create our own destiny. Do you want more love in your life? Start by accepting your own love. Do things you like to do. Take care. No more deals where you sell out your dreams. I want the best for me, and I insist that you do too. "/>
			<outline text="We gave our thanks in November. We asked for peace in December. Now we can look forward to the New Year with a positive, optimistic view of the future. Let our imaginations dream the best for us. Look for win-wins. Let's live in love, not fear. "/>
			<outline text="An example, Mac users, let's wish the best for Windows users, and hope that what goes around comes around."/>
			<outline text="A new year is a good time to reaffirm what we stand for. The things that count -- love, healing, fun, growth, each other, sharing, play, our friends, the people we're close with. "/>
			<outline text="It's January 1, 1996. A new year."/>
			<outline text="On the new year, so much is right with the world. "/>
			<outline text="Each of us is growing older."/>
			<outline text="But the world is so damned young!"/>
			<outline text="Yes."/>
			<outline text="***Going For It"/>
			<outline text="I never make New Years Resolutions, and this new year is no exception."/>
			<outline text="Instead, I made a list of wishes and added one new motto."/>
			<outline text="The motto -- Go For It -- permeates all my wishes."/>
			<outline text="I wish to go for love. No more fear in 1996."/>
			<outline text="I wish to go for it in my writing work, to be a great writer, to help define a new medium. I dream of being one of the writers that defines my generation. "/>
			<outline text="I want to take a couple of great skiing trips this year. At the top of the mountain, breathing clean air, invigorated by the sun, I want to go for it. "/>
			<outline text="My family of software products, Frontier, Clay Basket, www.scripting.com and the newest one (details later) MacBird, need complete development teams. They want to move to other platforms, to support new Internet standards, and perhaps define some of their own. 1996 will be a year of partnerships for me. New business friends, making cool stuff happen on the net. My software family needs new helpers and caretakers. No more fear. I'm going for it!"/>
			<outline text="1995 was a year of exploration and invention for me. I think 1996 will be a year of consolidation, delivery and realization. I'm going to make lots of new friends this year. I'm going to be inclusive, to invite new people into my life, and invite the people already in it to get closer."/>
			<outline text="A new year only comes once a year. "/>
			<outline text="That's done. "/>
			<outline text="On to the story-telling..."/>
			<outline text="Welcome to 1996!"/>
			<outline text="Thank you."/>
			<outline text="***They're our brothers"/>
			<outline text="Over the last few months I've made a bunch of new friends who are Unix users. I've found that we have a lot we agree on. "/>
			<outline text="Hey man, a geek is a geek. On that level we can relate. Why not?"/>
			<outline text="Windows NT is a great operating system. People I respect prefer it. I have an NT server on my network. I plan to learn more about it."/>
			<outline text="Macs are great computers too. A Macintosh web server is an amazing thing. Unix and NT sysops who look come away breathless. The content tools on the Mac are the best. And a lot of the most creative people prefer Macs."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft and Apple and Sun, etc are big companies with hairy politics. White boys and icons. Lots of fear."/>
			<outline text="Maybe they can't get along, but we can."/>
			<outline text="Let's leverage off the best that everyone has to offer."/>
			<outline text="I grew up on Unix, learned how to program from reading the source code for the system. I couldn't believe that such sparse stuff, when compiled, would turn into such a clean airy open operating system. It became the benchmark for my own code. Eventually I learned how to craft code as cleanly as the Unix OS source code. But it always was, and always will be, my standard."/>
			<outline text="I did some of my best software ever for the PC-compatibles in the early 80s. I have very fond memories of those days. It's true, I wish Apple had never let Windows happen, but that's done now. Microsoft is a great company. I really enjoy their energy. Great theater! "/>
			<outline text="Everyone counted the Mac out last summer, some still do. Between then and now the Net really happened at a whole new level. Where would Netscape be if they didn't have a Macintosh browser? Where would Macintosh people be if Netscape didn't have a Macintosh version? We all got lucky. Microsoft doesn't rule anymore, they neglected the Macintosh, now they can't afford to. They're rushing to get Macintosh versions of all their net stuff out. You know what happens when Microsoft cuts corners! Mac users know. Yessss."/>
			<outline text="Oh the race is on. The Mac isn't quite the cul-de-sac it used to be. It's on the way to somewhere. Where? No one really knows. For now there's Netscape. Java coming soon. Microsoft coming soon. But a lot of other stuff is already there. The Mac and the Internet is shaping up as a very interesting battleground. It's one of the few places where Microsoft will have to fight its way in, and in some cases they will have to fight against entrenched competitors with excellent products."/>
			<outline text="Yet there's a ton of negative energy in the Macintosh platform. But underneath the negative energy, Mac users talk with each other, and wonder what it will take to get some respect from the rest of the world. It's time to give up on Apple getting it. They can't help us. Speaking as a member of the Macintosh community, Apple does not speak for me. We have to help ourselves. There's a lot of work to do."/>
			<outline text="As a Macintosh developer and user, I offer my respect. Geek-to-geek, aren't we brothers and sisters? Unix and Windows people, can we work with you?"/>
			<outline text="Learn about what we're doing. "/>
			<outline text="We all win if it all works."/>
			<outline text="***It's not Blackbird"/>
			<outline text="As a New Years event I've released a new piece of software. It's a script-based graphic UI designer for the Macintosh, with special features for designing UIs for web applications. It's a beginning. For now it's only for the Macintosh. But I can imagine it running on other platforms, and I can easily see it as a design tool for people building Java applets."/>
			<outline text="It's called MacBird. A cute name, birds are cool, they fly. And it's not BlackBird, it's MacBird, get it? It's a fun product! With a cute name."/>
			<outline text="I've got a new website where you can check out screen shots or download the software. Right now it's still very much for Frontier geeks, but a runtime package is coming soon. Please watch the &quot;MacBird&quot; website."/>
			<outline text="This rounds out my products, which when put together are a script-driven multithreaded native network operating system with integrated content tools for the web. There are still lots of tweaks to do, but it works. I use all the tools every day. It's cool stuff for servers and content development, even client apps."/>
			<outline text="***It's not the Cool Site of the Day"/>
			<outline text="Glenn Davis, gdavis@projectcool.com, the cool site man, my net buddy, is in the office next to mine, working on New Year's Eve, getting his new website on the air. "/>
			<outline text="An hour ago he called me in to show off his new website. I took a break from writing this DaveNet piece and chatted with Glenn and his partner, Teresa Martin. Yes, they're doing cooooooool stuff, and some of them are sites, and they'll be doing it every day. The new site is on the air, in &quot;preview&quot; mode. Basically they'll roll out one new feature every day from January 1 thru the official launch date, January 15."/>
			<outline text="Tune into http://www.projectcool.com/. "/>
			<outline text="I gotta say it -- it's cooooool. "/>
			<outline text="Heh heh."/>
			<outline text="***Closer"/>
			<outline text="Finally, here's to a great 1996! "/>
			<outline text="Many happy returns. Let old acquaintances be forgot. You can't hurry love. We make shitty software. Onward and upward! Still digging. Namaste y'all!"/>
			<outline text="This year I want more than to be in love. "/>
			<outline text="I want to *be* love this year."/>
			<outline text="I'm going for it!"/>
			<outline text="Coooool."/>
			<outline text="You can too."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="Dave"/>
			<outline text="PS: According to Dave Jacobs, bigdave@wired.com, in Japanese you say gambati when you're ready to go for it. Next time I eat sushi I'll know. You too."/>

			<outline text="But this approach requires lots of bandwidth! "/>
			<outline text="If everyone were listening to music at the same time no one would be able to send email over the net. "/>
			<outline text="Ooooops."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Turn it around."/>
			<outline text="Add a new member to the band. A new kind of DJ that plays with web images. "/>
			<outline text="A new track on each music CD, the web-track. As the music passes over a certain place the CD player spits out a URL which is passed to the web browser which jumps to that page. "/>
			<outline text="The page is dynamic, it can be changed by the DJ on a daily or even hourly basis."/>
			<outline text="Little images. A few words. Fast. Server push, but from the client! "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/5/96; 7:47:40 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Ho. Is it really already January 5? Where has the year gone? Ohhhh this one is going to be fun. All my dreams are coming true. As they say be careful what you ask for you might just get it. Amen! MacBird is flying. Alanis is singing and Aretha is waiting in the wings, getting ready to sing on Monday."/>
			<outline text="***Everyone likes CDs with URLS"/>
			<outline text="I got a lot of email from the &quot;DJ DaveNet WWW&quot; piece I ran earlier this week. People like the idea of including URLs on music CDs. A bunch of people didn't get that this *isn't* the flip case, where the website contains the music. I don't care for this approach as much. My proposal is to leave the music where it is, just add hooks to the new stuff into the old stuff."/>
			<outline text="***My MacBird server got swamped"/>
			<outline text="If you were trying to connect to the MacBird web server yesterday, apologies -- my ISDN-based web server got totally swamped."/>
			<outline text="I've reorganized stuff and now my server is just doing the smart CGI-based stuff and the text and graphics are up on hotwired.com, further upstream, three steps closer to the backbone of the Internet, running on Unix boxes, proving that for now at least, my Mac-based setup isn't a world-class server system. Still digging. "/>
			<outline text="People like &quot;MacBird&quot;! That's cooool. Sorry for the inconvenience, dig we must, and thank you very much for your interest! (And patience...) There are lots of very creative people doing great stuff with my bird, and they deserve your attention. There's nothing like this on the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="***Pinch me!"/>
			<outline text="I had another dream, like the one I reported in &quot;A Worldwide Trance&quot;, 8/27/95, the DaveNet piece where I wrote about the fantastic dream I had shortly after attending the Windows 95 rollout in Redmond last summer."/>
			<outline text="Once again I wrote about the dream, like all good shrinks ask you to do. Then I submitted it to &quot;Upside&quot; Magazine and they ran it. It'll be out on Monday, just in time for MacWorld Expo, which starts on Tuesday. Visit Booth #3482 for your own copy. It'll also appear in your mailbox as a DaveNet piece on Monday. "/>
			<outline text="It's my favorite DaveNet ever. You're gonna love it. Stay tuned!"/>
			<outline text="***Superstars of Cyberspace"/>
			<outline text="I'm on the Tuesday keynote stage at &quot;MacWorld Expo&quot;, one of Steven Levy's Superstars of Cyberspace. If you want to see what I look like and I sound like, I promise to hum and float in real time. It's at 11:45 AM in the big ballroom at the SF Marriott. "/>
			<outline text="Maybe I should demo MacBird? Hmmm. Clay Basket? Why not? Talk about my dream? Sure! Chuck Shotton is on the panel too. Chuck and I have a lot to talk about! Yeah. Right Chuck? Hmmm. Gotta love it. "/>
			<outline text="I'm going to enjoy doing this panel."/>
			<outline text="***Charlie has a dream too"/>
			<outline text="Charlie Jackson, wiredcoach@aol.com, is an old friend from the early days of the Mac software business. He did SuperPaint and SuperCard, then sold out to Aldus for huge money. He retired from the software business to pursue his other passion -- building a great Olympic shooting team for the US. Along the way Charlie was the primary backer of Wired Magazine."/>
			<outline text="Now he's started FutureWave, http://www.futurewave.com/, a new software venture that holds a lot of promise for making the web a much faster place, dramatically lowering the bandwidth cost of graphics on websites. Everyone is going to love this idea, everyone from sysops to pre-teen web surfers. It's such a simple idea, I wonder why Netscape hasn't done something about this already. If Charlie and company can really deliver the technology, it's a no-brainer -- everyone is going to want this stuff."/>
			<outline text="So if you're at MacWorld Expo, check it out -- Booth #3779. And give Charlie a hearty handshake for me and thank him for caring enough to apply his huge creativity to the software world once again."/>
			<outline text="***That's it for now!"/>
			<outline text="Gotta run."/>
			<outline text="I'm doing something very interesting today. C developers will find this interesting, especially ones who work on Windows or Unix who have a Mac nearby. "/>
			<outline text="Who knows. Maybe the next hot web thing can come from the Mac community? "/>
			<outline text="I'm going for It. "/>
			<outline text="With any luck you'll be able to download it tomorrow. Watch your mailboxes tomorrow or Sunday, debugger-willing. "/>
			<outline text="And don't forget on Monday, the biggest DaveNet piece ever."/>
			<outline text="Be there."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Gotta Be Aretha!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/8/96; 7:53:09 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="I want to tell you about a dream I just had."/>
			<outline text="It's the night before MacWorld Expo opens in San Francisco, January 1996. I'm in a ballroom at the Marriott Hotel, in the center of a group of reporters from the business press. I'm wearing a suit. I smell nice. There's a very interesting energy in the room. People are looking at me. "/>
			<outline text="In the background a gospel angel is belting out a steady beat. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Sock it to me! "/>
			<outline text="She's humming and wailing. "/>
			<outline text="So am I."/>
			<outline text="I glance down at my badge. "/>
			<outline text="I see my name."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="Under my name is my title."/>
			<outline text="CEO."/>
			<outline text="Under that is the name of the company."/>
			<outline text="Apple Computer, Inc."/>
			<outline text="Uhhhhhhh."/>
			<outline text="Ohhhhhhh."/>
			<outline text="Pinch me!"/>
			<outline text="***It's just a dream"/>
			<outline text="You know the story."/>
			<outline text="The world is against Apple. We're having manufacturing problems. A few months ago our computers were exploding! A couple of system software fiascos. We just had a losing quarter. Windows 95 took the high ground from us in ease-of-use. The board wants layoffs. "/>
			<outline text="Spindler is out, he parachuted, the top vice-presidents are still there, waiting for orders. There's $1 billion in cash in the company. 14,000 employees. An installed base of about 20 million machines, maybe 13 million systems actually in use. "/>
			<outline text="The corporate world has delegated us to content production. Artists and families use our products. There's a geek community but it isn't recognized. Luckily, we have a growing suite of Internet content development tools. In some areas my platform is leading the market, but the world doesn't give us credit. "/>
			<outline text="Communication with the user and developer community has been improving, but panic is unabated. Key engineers are leaving the company. All but a few of our developers have left. People seem to use our product despite us. They like the Mac, but they hate us. No one has a kind word to say about the company I now run."/>
			<outline text="What would I do?"/>
			<outline text="Cooool!"/>
			<outline text="***Gotta be Aretha!"/>
			<outline text="To start, I'd buy a song. "/>
			<outline text="I like the Stones but I wouldn't call Mick Jagger. He already sold a song to Microsoft. I'd call Dave Matthews or the Indigo Girls or Annie Lennox or Alanis Morissete, but not this time. I want a respectful, fun song with a great beat. Something we can all dance to. A famous song. "/>
			<outline text="What you want, baby I got it. "/>
			<outline text="What you need you know I got it. "/>
			<outline text="All I'm asking for is a little."/>
			<outline text="&quot;R E S P E C T&quot;."/>
			<outline text="Find out what it means to me."/>
			<outline text="Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Sock it to me! "/>
			<outline text="Obviously."/>
			<outline text="Gotta be Aretha! "/>
			<outline text="Let's have a party! I need music. Cooool. Hehehe heeheheee. Lighten things up a bit. It's not really that grim. It's all a trance. Let's have fun! "/>
			<outline text="Cooool. "/>
			<outline text="***The Next Apple Product"/>
			<outline text="Step two. "/>
			<outline text="Let's look at the hardware lineup. Do we have a high-memory high bandwidth reliable plug-in-turn-on color computer that we can manufacture in huge quantity at a $2200 retail price? If not, how quickly can engineering get one ready? Use a well-burned-in version of the operating system. No experiments here. I'm looking for a lean-and-mean fast CPU, no bells and whistles, not state-of-the-art. Reliability and raw performance is what counts."/>
			<outline text="I want a new product to promote, one that's as recognizable as the Apple II, and as recognizable as the original Macintosh. Hey what kind of computer is that? It's an Apple. A computer that deserves your respect."/>
			<outline text="Contrary to the opinion of the rest of the industry, I think Apple is a computer company. We make computers. Any schoolkid can tell you that. What does Apple make? Computers. That's it."/>
			<outline text="Sorry, no more OpenDoc, no more CyberDog. Copland yes. New performance, yes! New paradigms, no way, not from Apple. "/>
			<outline text="Not until this mess gets straightened out."/>
			<outline text="***Ask the Developers for Help"/>
			<outline text="Next, I'd convene a small software developer conference. Invite twenty key people. People who have written great Mac software. People with great libraries. People who have Inside Macintosh committed to memory. Products and people I respect. It will be a respectful conference. I will bring my new $1 billion checkbook."/>
			<outline text="We talk about what people want to do. Explore our strengths and weaknesses. We support each other. We encourage competition. We make deals. What does Apple contribute? Money. In return, we get commitments, hard ones, contractual ones, that commit developers to delivering products by specific dates. We have to get this machine restarted. Luckily there are still lots of people who remember how to make Mac software. "/>
			<outline text="We share the platform with our developers. We need new software products. In return we guarantee to keep things much as they are. We'll make things faster, maybe much faster. We'll make cheaper systems. We'll fix our bugs. We'll do what we can to make the systems easier to use, but otherwise we'll be looking for new user experiences from the developers."/>
			<outline text="I will also invite the leading venture capitalists and industry analysts to a cocktail party at the conclusion of the developer meeting. Time to make new friends and reconnect with old ones. Software, meet the money. Money, here's the software. Coool. I might not have to write any checks."/>
			<outline text="***Check in with the Board"/>
			<outline text="Of course the Apple board members would be welcome at the cocktail party. The more they understand about developers, the more effective I will be as their CEO. Immediately after the developer meeting, we will have a board meeting to decide if we need to realign any of our investments. I will ask for a budget to pay developers money to commit to developing new products for the Macintosh platform. Can't make it work without money for developers."/>
			<outline text="At this meeting I'd be sure that each board member is an active Macintosh user. If they aren't I'd ask what it would take to get them to use the product. I'd offer to help them learn, personally, make it easy for them, as easy as possible. If they resisted the idea I'd ask them to consider the possibility of serving on the board of a company whose products they appreciate and use."/>
			<outline text="If there were any changes in the board composition at that time, I'd look for new members in the user community. Apple will also sponsor a user convention one day after our shareholder meeting. All Macintosh users are invited to the Macintosh user meeting. Only shareholders are welcome at the shareholder's meeting. Thru this announcement I will telegraph an invitation to all Macintosh users to become Apple shareholders. As CEO of the company, I'd prefer to report to people who use my products. We'd have an unbeatable advantage over any competitor. All our interests would be aligned. We could afford to take a longterm view. We'd know what we we're doing. Less guesswork. More opportunities for respect."/>
			<outline text="***Building steady sales"/>
			<outline text="The major business problem at Apple Computer is the guesswork in forecasting demand for our products. In software this isn't much of a problem, you can quickly manufacture more disks and books and boxes to meet demand. In computers, the business Apple is in, it's a bigger problem. Build too much and you lose money. Build too little and the penalty isn't quite as severe. So we'll err on the side of making too few computers. "/>
			<outline text="We allow people to place advance orders for the computers and guarantee delivery. If you know you'll need 20 Macs in six months, we can commit to that, and you get a great discount. Users groups find they have a new business. They can steady our demand, in return, earn a profit. And the new users will have friends who also use Macintoshes. We all know how important that is. If you're buying at retail you may find supplies are limited and the prices might be higher. That's the way it has to be."/>
			<outline text="Of course with this approach we may lose market share. So be it. But there will be lots of new software coming for the platform anyway, because we made great deals with developers. I kept some of Apple's lawyers on staff to be sure the developers understand that we were serious when we struck those deals."/>
			<outline text="***Building value for the shareholders"/>
			<outline text="So our future software is shored up, our distribution system is settling down, now let's focus on the only really important issue, building value for our shareholders."/>
			<outline text="I cancelled CyberDog, made a deal with Netscape. They committed to support the Macintosh platform on an equal standing with all their client and content software. We will continue to tap into the growth of Netscape's market. "/>
			<outline text="I invested in server operating systems and web programming environments. We built new streamlined hardware for web serving. We will equal the competition on performance, and blow them away in power. We plan to be competitive in this business, it's an important one; we have an advantage and we're exploiting it."/>
			<outline text="We launched a new web service where we showcase the current state-of-the-art in web content tools. We update the server frequently to match the incredible rate at which Macintosh web content tools are shipping. The service is free to developers and users. We run ads on the pages, of course, and make money on each copy of each software product that sells thru this channel."/>
			<outline text="I'm cancelling the dividend for 1996 and all forseeable years. If you want dividends, invest in a low-growth stock. We're going to use the money to invest in pre-public companies that develop products for our users. When they develop something new and unique, we'll tell the world about what they've done. Maybe, if the product is really good, we'll buy a song for them!"/>
			<outline text="When growth happens, when a new seed bears fruit, when something happens for the first time on our platform, the world will know. No more Mr. Quiet Nice Underappreciated Apple Computer. We want your respect. We've earned it and we will continue to earn it."/>
			<outline text="The big picture: we're going to invest in our community, we're going to bet on them as they have bet on us. We'll all grow together and make money together. "/>
			<outline text="We'll have fun."/>
			<outline text="That's it for now."/>
			<outline text="Thanks for your support!"/>

			<outline text="A quote: &quot;Using test scripts to compare AppleScript and UserTalk, Frontier's language, on a Power Mac 8100/80, Frontier's execution zoomed past AppleScript's by 11 times, while calls to library subroutines were more than 40 times faster.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Another quote: &quot;Every Mac scriptor should take a look at the new Frontier. Compared with AppleScript, it provides a richer, better- documented language, better integration with other applications, greater Power Mac performance and a built-in database. With all these features, Frontier has earned a permanent place in our desktop arsenal.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I'd add: Frontier and Clay Basket are unique to the Macintosh. There is no scripting environment on Windows or even Unix that matches the power of Frontier. This power makes publishing systems, groupware applications, web servers and web content development apps that run on Mac networks much more powerful than anything running on other platforms. "/>

			<outline text="To those who've asked -- yes, I saw today's Wall Street Journal article about Sun acquiring Apple for $4 billion. They say a deal is imminent."/>
			<outline text="I've not been able to confirm this story. In fact, I have spoken with people who say that the story is wrong. They say a deal is not imminent."/>
			<outline text="So, we don't know if Apple is becoming a subsidiary of Sun."/>
			<outline text="But I do have a few comments."/>
			<outline text="Sun would gain a full operating system to run behind Java. A much richer runtime environment is possible if you have an OS to play with. Microsoft will certainly explore this possibility as their web browser digs into the Windows OS in upcoming releases. It's certain to happen on the Windows side. Sun may *need* this deal to keep Java viable longterm. "/>
			<outline text="The combined companies would own two important Internet markets due to Sun's position in the server business and Apple's position in content development. If sensible technology-driven directions were followed, I believe this could be translated into an advantage in client systems."/>
			<outline text="Unix guys working with Mac guys. Lots of interesting possibilities there. Connections between content and servers. I like this!"/>
			<outline text="If Sun actually does make an offer it would indicate that they don't buy into the $500 Internet terminal idea. What's the point of a Macintosh with no local disk drive? Maybe I'm missing something."/>
			<outline text="I believe Sun may be maneuvering to get a better price. If so, they should grab now. $4 billion is a fair price for Apple. There's more value in the Mac platform than there is in Java. And that's not slighting the value of Java. The two products would multiply."/>
			<outline text="Sun can buy Apple because Apple has not been able to leverage its connection with the Internet into value for its shareholders. This happened because Apple management was not aware of the innovations shipped by independent Mac developers. They were focused inward when they should have been looking outward. As the stories are coming out about Apple's previous attempts to get acquired, it's becoming clearer that at the top levels of Apple they were focused on getting out of, not staying in the business."/>
			<outline text="We live in interesting times."/>

			<outline text="Of course we intend to execute our license with Sun for Java; both companies have people working on this issue every day. We have no time for half measures; we announced our Letter of Intent with Sun in December because we were serious about Java support."/>
			<outline text="We are not anti-Java at all, we think it is a fine language and will see use eventually and we intend to support it. We are language neutral, we also happen to think that a lot of code will still get written in C++ and in Visual Basic and other environments. We intend to support them all. As we do today, we will evangelize multiple languages, because there are certain segments of the developer community that will be better served by Visual Basic than by Java and vice versa. One size doesn't fit all."/>
			<outline text="With respect to Visual Basic in particular, there are 3 million or more VB programmers, writing literally billions of lines of code every year. It would be imprudent to ignore this asset, this talent pool. We want to open up the Internet opportunity to all those people, and get the benefit of all their abilities to push Internet development ahead even faster. "/>
			<outline text="We encourage everyone in the community to support VB programmers in their products, we are making it extremely easy to do so. The specs for VBS are on our website today, we will make the source available freely, we will incorporate it into our Internet products on all platforms. Netscape should add this support to Navigator, we think that would be a great service to the VB programmer community and to Netscape users. 3 million developers is a lot to ignore."/>
			<outline text="We will talk at greater length about our exact plans for Java and VB support at our next major developer event which is our Professional Developer's Conference in March, I invite you all to attend."/>

			<outline text="I was in a meeting last week at a major software company, not Microsoft. Executives sitting around a table. Demo. Lots of questions. Inquiring minds. I was getting reamed. I liked it. Everything I know about this software is being discovered. Loopholes discovered. Some of the truth comes out."/>
			<outline text="***Web Energy"/>
			<outline text="Midway into the meeting, the sysop of the company's website enters the room. You can spot a web person easily. I experience it as a connection to truth. An honest smile. The truth shining in their eyes. &quot;Great Hair&quot;. We share the fun we're having. It's a great big undefined world we're playing in. It's a fun life! You get to meet such coooool people. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***The Birth of a Platform"/>
			<outline text="I've been lucky to be present at the birth of four platforms: Apple II, IBM PC, Macintosh and now Java. What makes a platform happen? It's web energy! Yes. Thanks again!"/>
			<outline text="Today we experience the rush of a new platform in the form of web energy. We've tapped into that energy flow before, but we've never before had the communications tools to talk about it. The Internet boom is being covered like no other new platform ever has. We can learn about the process, and share what we've learned."/>
			<outline text="Like all new platforms, Java was born from the efforts of a very small group of people working in relative obscurity. Their isolation challenged them. They had something to prove, to the corporation, to the world, and to themselves. I imagine this happens a lot inside large corporations, and often either the people aren't good enough, the time isn't right, or the corporation interferes with the process. In normal times big corporations are not good places to take over the world from. Only when the planets line up perfectly does  something as magical as a new platform happen. Everything has to be right."/>
			<outline text="Once the platform takes root, creative people have to leave. It's always that way. The corporate energy flows in and organizes things. You need lots of good people to support developers, develop related technology, port the software, to manage huge developer's conferences, to keep it all working."/>
			<outline text="When the system works, creative people spin off from the mother ship. The focus shifts. That's how the platform gets some of its best timed and positioned application products. That's how niches get served. It's the yin and yang of the process. Platform happens, new companies form. The platform vendor digs in. The intrapreneurs become entrepreneurs. If everything's coool, everyone gets what they need. "/>
			<outline text="It's a win-win, but sometimes it takes a big heart to see it that way."/>
			<outline text="***It's a great time to be Sun"/>
			<outline text="Java is happening, lifting the value of Sun's stock. Huge volumes of positive geek energy (web energy!) flow thru the small office on Hamilton Avenue in Palo Alto. The phone rings off the hook. It grows. The original spark of energy inside Sun that created Java is consumed by the load. Managers are hired. Meetings! Life changes. "/>
			<outline text="They want to make great software. It's time to move on. So they move on."/>
			<outline text="The news is out. Suck got the scoop. "/>
			<outline text="Check out http://www.suck.com/dynasuck/96/01/26/. Great lead! Great art. Irreverent as usual. The young web energy at suck wins again! I admire the suck guys. They must hate that!"/>

			<outline text="If they had warm hearts at Sun, they'd realize that their stock is overvalued. Java is nice, but Microsoft is right -- it isn't there yet. The Internet could still be Visual Basic Land. 3 million users. It might not be a cup of coffee. It could happen. "/>
			<outline text="Fear! Sometimes it *is* prudent to give in to your fear. The Java strategy could use an insurance policy. Apple is cheap at $4 billion when you look at it this way. "/>
			<outline text="It's not time to be quibbling over small amounts of money. Think big, Scott McNealy, Bill Joy, Eric Schmidt and John Doerr. "/>
			<outline text="The developers are still making great software. If you doubt me, ask Bill Gates. His company just shipped a very respectful web browser for the Mac. There's heat in this platform. Don't let Microsoft off the hook. Let the Mac drift and your impossible dream once again becomes impossible."/>
			<outline text="Think of Apple as a power plant in Sim City. It's turned off. We'll turn it back on. $4 billion is cheap compared to the value of the installed base. Lots of people know how to make Mac software. You don't forget how to do it. It's like riding a bicycle or skiing. When the heat comes back to the Mac platform, when you let love be the driving process not fear, the lights will come back on just like a Sim city with a new power plant."/>
			<outline text="Developers want to have fun. While there's all this hand-wringing in FinanceLand, the magic on the Mac platform just keeps happening. Don't focus on Markkula and Spindler. They're vestiges of an old world that's finally ready to give up. Make a gift to the young creative people who are charged by the energy of the Internet.

			<outline text="We've shared schmoozes at many venues for many years. Both Heidi and I were there at the beginning of the Mac platform. Developers. First buzzed, then pissed that Apple was getting in our way, not being an effective leader, stealing our thunder, and making it impossible for us to have fun."/>
			<outline text="I had dinner with Heidi a couple of weeks before she took the top developer job at Apple. I encouraged her to take the job. Nothing but upside. You can only make it better. If Apple is willing to let one of *us* on the inside, they must be ready for ch-ch-ch-anges."/>
			<outline text="No one will think less of her for trying. I certainly won't. I thanked her in DaveNet a few days ago, and I still thank her. But now, she's one of them! Coooool. Heidi, get a life. Apple sucks! Let's fix it."/>
			<outline text="Take an inventory of software that Apple is actively developing and compare it against the software that the developer community is working on. Where there's a conflict, I encourage you to go with the stuff the developers are doing. The economics are much better for Apple. Competitive markets are where it's at. Stop the hegemony!"/>
			<outline text="Put together strategies for markets that Mac is strong in, even if Apple doesn't have a single product in that market. Scripting is an excellent example. Apple's product isn't competitive. I want a strategy that says how we're going to use the depth of scripting on the Mac platform for a competitive advantage versus other platforms. I want everyone to know that what we're doing is real and important. Air cover from the platform vendor is absolutely essential. We've been starving without it. For years!"/>
			<outline text="Think content. The Mac is the platform of great content and great geek tools. Director, PhotoShop, Quark, PageMaker, Metrowerks. I've said it before. When you see a new content tool show up, focus lots of energy. Sing along with them. Especially if it's a web content tool. Apple's shareholders will thank you."/>
			<outline text="Teach Apple's internal developers to work with your developers. This means adopting developer's APIs. Sorry guys, the world does not revolve around you. Go with the flow. Teach them how to compete! "/>
			<outline text="Starting point -- get the CyberDog people to adopt menu sharing. What's menu sharing? There it is -- that's the problem! Netscape supports it. I bet Microsoft will support it. If they want to be competitive in the Mac browser business they must support it. While you're at it, encourage the Finder team to support menu sharing too."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft and Netscape are big enough to work with small developers when it's prudent. It's time for Apple's internal developers to join the real world, as equals, not as gods. Bill and Andy thought they were gods, but that was just an illusion. Today Apple is humbled. That humility can translate into action. Pragmatic development. We can have fun together if they'll come down and work with us instead of preaching to us."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I wrote to the leaders at Sun about their developer program. They don't have one, so it's a good time to talk about it. Heidi, neither do you! Start from scratch. For you to be effective, you're going to have to make great changes happen inside Apple. Clear space for us. I think Guy is right, we *are* the marines. You're the air force. We want some clear space to play in. Get Apple out of the way, and then get them to work with us."/>

			<outline text="The act has passed both houses of the US Congress. "/>

			<outline text="The bill may also restrict discussion of abortion on the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Rory J. O'Connor, rjoconnor@aol.com, Washington correspondent for the &quot;San Jose Mercury-News&quot;, confirms this:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Technically, the language was sucked into the bill when Hyde added a technical amendment that was supposed to cover obscenity on the Internet. But he and pro-choice Rep. Nita Lowey, D-NY, engaged in a scripted exchange on the House floor (called a colloquy) in which Hyde said he didn't mean it and she said, thanks, I understand. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;That exhange gives a court something to use in a case involving the language (a &quot;sense of Congress&quot;) that satisfied all but the most ardent critics of the bill. That happened at about 2:30, well before the final vote.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="Many people believe this law is unconstitutional. Seems that way to me. I'm not a lawyer, but I am a US citizen, raised with the basic right to say what I want to say, with certain limits that make sense. "/>
			<outline text="This law seems to cross into areas that are protected by the US Constitution. "/>
			<outline text="I grew up in a country where it was none of the government's business if I want to write or read about sexuality."/>
			<outline text="As I've said in earlier DaveNet pieces, when I was growing up, my family subscribed to magazines that included sexual imagery. I don't feel it harmed me in any way, quite the opposite! Sexuality is one of the most beautiful things about humanity. To outlaw something so important will create a national wound and an international crisis."/>
			<outline text="This is also a major step backwards thru evolution. It will create incomplete children who become unhealthy adults."/>
			<outline text="Further, to limit discussion of abortion, one of the most gut-wrenching social issues, is totally unthinkable. It's possible to respect anti-abortion advocates, even if you believe they're wrong as I do, but to attempt to make it illegal to disagree with them reeks of totalitarianism. This is not something a reasonable person can support, even if they're opposed to abortion. "/>

I don't care if it's unconstitutional. Clinton is the president of the United States. Remember what that means! Let's be clear that attempted censorship is a crime against humanity, much as attempted murder is serious felony. "/>
			<outline text="We are offended. It may not be the end. These guys run campaigns. They're here for the long haul. Gore looks good. That man will run for president some day, and he knows it. What is he really saying about us? He looks good, until you look at the truth. "/>
			<outline text="Times of great change."/>
			<outline text="Everybody loves the sound of the &quot;train in the distance&quot;. "/>

			<outline text="But the train is right here, right now. "/>
			<outline text="Which way are you going?"/>
			<outline text="***Keep breathing!"/>
			<outline text="When things change, great fear comes up."/>
			<outline text="Lots of us try to live low-risk lives, hoping for no change, holding everything in place. Holding our breath. Not dancing. But no matter how hard you try, the world still turns. Eventually change is so great that the movie reel snaps and you become aware of your surroundings. "/>
			<outline text="The earthquake in 1989 was like that. Freeways crash, bridges break, buildings fall, neighborhoods burn down. All those lives connected in new meaningful ways. We got a lot closer. Most people made it, but some died. "/>
			<outline text="Those who survived learned a lot."/>
			<outline text="It changed our lives."/>
			<outline text="So -- if the foundation of your life is built on the assumption that the Mac business will remain as-is, or that you can freely express yourself thru the Internet; if either of these assumptions is challenged, your life is about to change, perhaps in a big way."/>

			<outline text="I love reading &quot;Amy Tan&quot;'s books. When the power was out last month, I read her latest, &quot;The Hundred Secret Senses&quot;. Her most famous book is the Joy Luck Club, which was also a great movie."/>
			<outline text="Almost all I know about Chinese culture comes from Tan's books. They are spiritual and friendly. She's personal. She lives in San Francisco, so I know some of the neighborhoods she writes about. I like that!"/>
			<outline text="Her characters are reincarnated. She's an optimist! I like that too."/>
			<outline text="She writes at the interface between two cultures -- California and China. Those are my favorite parts of her books. When I see a Chinese person in California I can't help but imagine that they're a character in one of her books."/>
			<outline text="I pick up the flavor of Chinese talking. It's a culture built on humility and good cooking. You must criticize your own cooking, and you must always praise your Auntie's. "/>
			<outline text="Chinese is a culture of many metaphor. Short sentence. Drop plural consonant. "/>
			<outline text="Chinese writing is about cooking. Many flavor. Highest quality."/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is about highest quality writing. "/>
			<outline text="With many flavor."/>
			<outline text="The very best I can do."/>
			<outline text="Hmmm. Sometimes too salty!"/>
			<outline text="Dig we must!"/>
			<outline text="Like Amy Tan, I write about the intersection of two cultures -- the online world and humanity. It's a recursive thing because DaveNet is an online entity, and of course, I am a human being."/>
			<outline text="Hello!"/>
			<outline text="***Who asked?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Rick Smolan&quot;, rick.smolan@applelink.apple.com, asked me to explain DaveNet for his new project, &quot;24 Hours In Cyberspace&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="I liked the idea, so I decided to go for it."/>
			<outline text="Rick has been a friend since 1983. That's thirteen years! Man that's a long time. I remember when I first met him, he was an accomplished photographer for Time, Life and National Geographic. He was exploring computers as a way of linking together large numbers of photographers. His friends travel the globe the way I move around the web today. They needed technology to connect them together."/>
			<outline text="Over the years I did more software and Rick used software to produce a series of photo-books that were events. A Day in the Life of America. &quot;A Passage to Vietnam&quot;. Each book was an event, a community, a snapshot of the life of a culture. A labor of love! Definitely. You could put the result on your coffee table, then your bookshelf. And next year there was another country, another culture, and less visibly, another level of technology explored."/>
			<outline text="Rick's world and my world have intersected for thirteen years. Now it intersects at a different level. I've become a webwriter, and Rick is bringing photography to the web. This DaveNet piece implements part of the intersection. It appears in the normal flow of DaveNet-stuff, but it's also part of the 24 Hours project; it appears on Rick's website at http://www.cyber24.com. And it's possible that the text, or some part of it, will appear in the coffee-table book. Later today I'll be at their headquarters in San Francisco to have my picture taken by Rick and to talk with other people about this project. Maybe Amy Tan will be there? It's going to be a fun day! Yes."/>
			<outline text="So Rick asked &quot;Dave, what is DaveNet?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here goes..."/>
			<outline text="***Active Journalism"/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is writing. It's electronic. It's interactive. "/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is not usually reporting, but occasionally I get a scoop. "/>
			<outline text="It's active journalism. I try to influence influential people. I allow myself to try to make the news myself. It's recursive! And I think that's OK."/>
			<outline text="Sometimes it's a channel to present other people's ideas, ones that I think are important. When &quot;Marc Andreessen&quot; wants to talk about web technology he can use my platform. If &quot;Al Gore&quot; has something to say about freedom of speech on the Internet, I would be happy to carry his message. If you aren't a principal, but you have something elegant or funny to say -- I want that too."/>
			<outline text="DaveNet an experimental medium. I get to play with new kinds of software, a hybrid of prose and scripts and C. Music and movies! Words and beauty. I started DaveNet as a commercial software developer. Now I have writing experience. I get interesting ideas that may not occur to other people because I do both things. Want a new example? Check out my &quot;Pointers&quot; page."/>
			<outline text="I like leaving out detail. I like to create puzzles. I wonder how many people get the little stories between the lines. There are connections that I don't bother to point out. You don't know who &quot;Ed Kranepool&quot; is? Figure it out. I don't have time to explain. Everyone should know how to use an Internet search engine. Go for it!"/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is entertainment. That's why they're called Amusing Rants, not Perfect Truths or Grand Visions or Bold Initiatives. They are just the things that occur to me as I live my life. It's one life, it's mine. DaveNet is one way I share what I have."/>
			<outline text="DaveNet gives you something to react to. It gives exposure to ideas. I hope it's stimulating. I hope it helps expose *your* beliefs and feelings. Or gives you a new idea. Often."/>
			<outline text="Other media do the same thing. Watch 60 Minutes. Mike Wallace is angry! Leslie Stahl is surprised. Andy Rooney tells the truth. They evoke your feelings. It's hard to turn 60 Minutes off without having an opinion and a feeling."/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is personal. It can be more personal than a TV show because it only takes one person to do DaveNet. You get a cleaner connection. There's no editor between you and me. You get exactly the characters I type into my outliner. Like Rick, I use software to connect people together."/>
			<outline text="To the extent that I can listen to myself and express what I hear, you're getting pure unadulterated human being here. Yes sometimes there is noise. I get confused! "/>
			<outline text="One week I admire Microsoft's new web browser for the Mac. The next week I get the full picture of what they plan to do, and I fear for this peaceful land. Even though these stories contradict each other, there is no contradiction. "/>
			<outline text="I try to remain centered on what &quot;Microsoft&quot; is. As the world shifts, the effect of Microsoft is felt in different ways. And don't overlook the certainty that Microsoft will change. Nothing stays the same, although sometimes it may be more comfortable to believe that things do."/>
			<outline text="Some people say &quot;DaveNet&quot; is self-serving. Of course! We could argue that all opinionated writing is self-serving. But it's a boring argument. Maybe I'll find an interesting angle on this someday. Bill Gates has a column in the New York Times. What an interesting combo! Hmmmm. Cooool. Why not?"/>
			<outline text="***It's called communication"/>
			<outline text="People run programs just like computers do. Certain input yields the same output every time with every person. If I tell you a sad story in an interesting way, if it involves you, your disbelief suspends -- you feel the same sadness. If I can express my anger cleanly -- it will reach inside you and you can access the same anger. If I can access your sense of right and wrong, truth and falsehood, if I can get right in there -- you'll laugh, just like I do! "/>
			<outline text="If you see me in color, that allows you to see your colors too. "/>
			<outline text="Don't overlook puns in our language. How do you feel? A really strong emotional feeling can be felt physically in your body. I feel things as I write. If you read them you feel them too."/>
			<outline text="It's called communication. It's what human beings do. When we access each other's center, cut thru all the experiences we have, get underneath that, it provides the proof we all need that we're not alone in this world. We're not. If you like DaveNet that's part of the reason you like it. It's evidence that you're not alone. I'm here! It may seem like I'm your friend. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="I think we all like to have our centers reached. It makes you feel good even if you're feeling sad or angry. It's as old as story-telling. The scenery in my stories is technology, but the stories are as old as humanity. Technology is all about people. That's more true with computers today than it ever has been. "/>
			<outline text="Exploring the differences, the unique qualities of each person, is where the beauty is. If every flower were exactly the same, none of them would be beautiful! It's our differences, our struggles to reach our centers, that makes each of us unique and beautiful."/>
			<outline text="If I see you as more than a reflection of myself, I experience your uniqueness, I experience beauty and my life is richer. We're all running that program. "/>
			<outline text="We share our individuality. That's love. "/>
			<outline text="We pretend everyone is just like us -- that's fear."/>
			<outline text="***Communication used to suck"/>
			<outline text="If you're an adult in 1996, you grew up in a culture that tried to flatten everything out, to rewrite our programs, almost by edict. Like the legislature that tried to redefine pi to equal 3. It was a lunatic way to live. You could be happy and emotionless at the same time. Not! Every human feeling was outlawed, but you were supposed to be happy. Hmmm. It didn't work."/>
			<outline text="The old programs: suburbia, television, freeways, communists. They weren't exercises in healing. Instead of cutting thru our layers, they added more layers. More stuff to process, not less. Less communication not more."/>
			<outline text="Communication used to suck. TV is a narrow pipe. It supported the freeway lifestyle. It simulates community, but we all end up with the same friends -- Roseanne and Homer. Butthead and Picard. Pick your poison! These guys are not friends, they are entertainment."/>
			<outline text="The web can be different. It's the medium of epiphany. Each link is an instance of communication. Linking is an artform. When I find something interesting on your site that fits into something I'm talking about on mine, I create a link. "/>
			<outline text="Holding hands in cyberspace! As Rick says -- we're painting on the wall of the digital cave. "/>
			<outline text="Putting your thoughts on a web page is an invitation to anyone to take your hand. It's an open medium. A link is a connection between people. A web page is an open hand."/>
			<outline text="A link is a tunnel. It connects two places that weren't connected. It allows new flows to build. When &quot;www.suck.com&quot; links to DaveNet, DaveNet gets more flow. When DaveNet points to &quot;PointCast&quot;, they get more flow. "/>
			<outline text="That's the Information Superhighway -- but it isn't just information! "/>
			<outline text="It's ourselves."/>
			<outline text="It's a new way for humans to be present."/>
			<outline text="It's different."/>
			<outline text="It's coooool."/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***The medium of media"/>
			<outline text="Look at how far we've come. "/>
			<outline text="Re-read this piece imagining that it's 1993 and you're reading a random email message. Could I have talked about love and fear so easily? Would you have been ready to hear it? I wasn't ready to write about it in 1993! No way."/>
			<outline text="For me it's about evolution. Growing. Sharing. It's about love! Yes."/>
			<outline text="Another conclusion -- DaveNet works only if lots of people do the same thing.  There's lots of evidence! So much creativity is being unleashed. True, there's lots of mindless crap on the web, but there's also a lot of work to do."/>
			<outline text="All forms of expression need to be on the web. I want to write about &quot;Dave Matthews&quot; next week. I want to point at music clips so you can listen while you read. Technologically and economically there's nothing in the way. It's just a matter of time before every movie and every song has a presence on the web."/>
			<outline text="That's creativity! As artists from other media leap onto the web, there will be new epiphany. I'm a writer. Right now this is my medium. But as time goes by it becomes the medium of media. There's nothing specific about the web. Every form of human expression will flow thru it. That's why it's so exciting!"/>
			<outline text="The &quot;24 Hours in CyberSpace&quot; project is a very important milestone. It's a chance to welcome the highest quality photographers to our world. It's a first step to gather a massive amount of new content from the world of pictures and text. It's an intersection. I get to collaborate with my friends. We have fun! We learn. We share. It's cooool."/>
			<outline text="So...."/>
			<outline text="Every person who pours their creativity into the worldwide web deserves our thanks. Putting up a website is an optimistic act. It's an offer for a connection. Let's link! Yes."/>
			<outline text="Saying what you think, really listening to yourself and then learning how to communicate is an act of evolution. "/>
			<outline text="They should be supported and encouraged and thanked for taking a chance."/>
			<outline text="Every time someone steps out and shares their self with the world, they are being vulnerable. "/>
			<outline text="Even more so, in just a few hours..."/>
			<outline text="***Not Fun Stuff!"/>
			<outline text="Today's the day that President Clinton signs the Telecommunications Act of 1996. "/>
			<outline text="Sally Atkins, sally@kins.com, writes: &quot;This is a major day. 24 Hours in Cyberspace feels to me like fiddling while Rome burns. Stupid Internet tricks on the day when Clinton signs the bill.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yes Sally! We could look at it that way. But we could also stay focused on the reasons why it's lunacy. The best demo is to have fun, no matter who says we can't. The President! Man. We'll get his ass. We get to say who our next president is. I'm voting against Clinton in November. I don't care who runs against him. I'm a one-issue man."/>
			<outline text="They're attacking the net before we had a chance to organize our economics and political power. In a couple of years we'll be too big to control. Things are growing so fast. They assume they know what our world will look like in November. My bet: they don't have a clue!"/>
			<outline text="Black pages today. "/>
			<outline text="Blue ribbons everywhere. "/>
			<outline text="And Rick and his photographer buddies move onto the Internet."/>
			<outline text="I say welcome! And let's have fun. Now! And later."/>
			<outline text="In February: Clinton tries to shut down free speech on the net."/>
			<outline text="In November: we send Clinton back to Little Rock."/>

			<outline text="Got up this morning and headed for Planet Hollywood, a place I never would have stepped foot in otherwise, to do a panel with Paul Saffo and Esther Dyson. Illustra got this big to-do together weeks ago, as self-promotion leveraged on Rick Smolan's self-promotion. I thought Rick was doing a pretty cool thing, bring people's attention to some of the pleasant and beneficial things happening in cyberspace. God knows we need as much of that as possible to counter the hysteria whipped up by Ralph Reed and buddies. Illustra seems like a cool product. Empowers people to publish. And they paid me."/>
			<outline text="This morning turned out, through one of those weird accidents that history hands you, the day of the Web blackout. I blacked out my main page before I headed out this morning."/>
			<outline text="The Illustra thing, frankly, was one of the biggest wasted opportunities I've ever seen. They did a great job getting a couple hundred interesting people together and then put on a boring blah-blah for hours."/>
			<outline text="Then came the panel. I always take the opportunity to seize the subject and wrench it over to how the fuck are we going to look our children in the eyes ten years from now when they ask us what we were doing while a bunch of tiny-minded puritan fascists shat on liberties that Americans have died for. I think some people woke up. At least they said so. I hope I gave them something to talk about. I feel fine about the bux I took from Illustra to do the gig.  And I felt fine about helping Illustra promote 24 Hours promote Illustra. Until I read my Davemail tonight."/>
			<outline text="Rick. Be a journalist. You are the last hope on an ugly day."/>
			<outline text="American journalists, with a few exceptions should hang their heads in shame. I'm one of the guys who gets the calls for the quotes and soundbites. For years. Ever since this Internet stuff started heating up. I've done ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, BBC, NHK. I've done German, French, Austrian, Italian, Australian TV. I've given the quotes to the reporters from the New York Times, Washington Post, L.A. Times, and a hundred podunk papers. And every goddamn sound bite about democracy hits the cutting room floor and is replaced by the same idiotic shtick about cyberporn or sexual predators in chat rooms. Over and over again. For years."/>
			<outline text="I have asked reporters whether they care about the kind of country their children grow up in. I literally got down on my knees and begged the last CBS crew that came out here. The reporters and field producers are sincere. There is some asshole sitting in LA or New York whose job it is to kill the stuff that isn't as shallow as a tin pan full of cold dogpiss, and substitute some off-the-rack sleaze."/>
			<outline text="There is a code of ethics for journalists, and right up there at the top is a reminder that the press in a free society has an obligation to inform citizens about those events that affect our freedom. Well, journalism is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of entertainment, and these journalists have loaded the shotgun, handed it to their enemies, dropped their trousers, bent over, and put the muzzles in their own asses. I believe most of the editors and producers who failed us so miserably have done it out of cluelessness more than malice or conspiracy or craven sucking-up-to-the-owners."/>
			<outline text="The most important piece of legislation in the past fifty years took a year to work its way through Congress and is now law. A multi-trillion dollar industry has been divvied up. Do any of us know who really won and who really lost? Does anybody know about any of it except the cyberporn stuff? It was a sideshow, a juicy piece of meat to distract the watchdogs of our minds, while the real action took place elsewhere."/>
			<outline text="I've been writing columns about this since 1994. So has Brock. Wired has been on the case. And very few others."/>
			<outline text="It isn't just the politicians who deserve our wrath, the craven cowards. It's the journalists and their bosses."/>
			<outline text="But history handed us this delicious opportunity. After a year of failure to get the attention of the New York Times and CNNs of the world, Rick Smolan, media lubricator extraordinaire, managed to get a lot of attention focused on something happening on the Net that *isn't* sinister."/>
			<outline text="And now Dave Winer tells us that Rick isn't going to acknowledge the Web blackout."/>
			<outline text="Rick, it's this simple. You are a journalist. You chose February 8 as your day to cover. To ignore the anti-CDA protest that is one of the biggest stories on the day you chose to cover months ago is to abrogate the right to ever call yourself a journalist again. It isn't too late. I know this is a headache you didn't ask for. Sometimes history asks people to make a judgement call at a bad time. Sometimes people regret the decisions the failed to make. We have an opportunity here to use all the attention you have masterfully focused on this event to shed some light. You gotta do it."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/8/96; 9:43:59 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="This piece was forwarded to me with the statement &quot;This article may be reproduced free forever.&quot; It appears to have been written by Steve Russell, who describes himself: &quot;Steve Russell, retired after 16 years as a trial judge in Texas, is Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Texas at San Antonio.&quot; I don't have an email address for Mr. Russell."/>
			<outline text="SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- You motherfuckers in Congress have dropped over the edge of the earth this time.  I understand that very few of the swarm of high dollar lobbyists around the Telecommunications Bill had any interest in content regulation -- they were just trying to get their clients an opportunity to dip their buckets in the money stream that cyberspace may become -- but the public interest sometimes needs a little attention. Keeping your eyes on what big money wants, you have sold out the First Amendment."/>
			<outline text="First, some basics.  If your children walked by a public park and heard some angry sumbitches referring to Congress as &quot;the sorriest bunch of cocksuckers ever to sell out the First Amendment&quot; or suggesting that &quot;the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists' dicks and fuck the people who sent you there,&quot; no law would be violated (assuming no violation of noise ordinances or incitement to breach the peace).  If your children did not wish to hear that language, they could only walk away. Thanks to your heads-up-your-ass dereliction of duty, if they read the same words in cyberspace, they could call the FBI!"/>
			<outline text="Cyberspace is the village green for the whole world.  It is the same as the village green our Founders knew as the place to rouse the rabble who became Americans, but it is also different.  Your blind acceptance of the dubious -- make that dogass dumb -- idea that children are harmed by hearing so-called dirty words has created some pretty stupid regulations without shutting down public debate, but those stupid regulations will not import to cyberspace without consequences that even the public relations whores in Congress should find unacceptable."/>
			<outline text="In cyberspace, there is no time.  A posted message stays posted until it is wiped.  Therefore, there is no way to indulge the fiction that children do not stay up late or cannot program a VCR."/>
			<outline text="In cyberspace, there is no place.  The &quot;community standards&quot; are those of the whole world.  An upload from Amsterdam can become a download in Idaho.  By trying to regulate obscenity and indecency on the Internet, you have reduced the level of expression allowed consenting adults to that of the most anal retentive blueballed fuckhead U.S. attorney in the country. The Internet is everywhere you can plug in a modem.  Call Senator Exon an &quot;ignorant motherfucker&quot; in Lincoln, Nebraska and find yourself prosecuted in Bibleburg, Mississippi."/>
			<outline text="In cyberspace, you cannot require the convenience store to sell Hustler in a white sleeve.  The functional equivalent is gatekeeper software, to which no civil libertarian has voiced any objection. Gatekeeper software cannot be made foolproof, but can you pandering pissants not see that any kid smart enough to hack into a Website is also smart enough to get his hands on a hard copy of Hustler if he really wants one?"/>
			<outline text="In cyberspace, there is the illusion of anonymity but no real privacy.  It is theoretically possible for any Internet server to seine through all messages for key words (although it seems likely the resulting slowdown would be noticeable).  Perhaps some of you read about America OnLine's attempt to keep children from reading the word &quot;breast?&quot;  An apparently unforeseen consequence was the shutdown of a discussion group of breast cancer survivors.  Don't you think more kids are aware of &quot;teat&quot; (pronounced &quot;tit&quot;) than of &quot;breast?&quot; Can skirts on piano legs, er, limbs be far behind?"/>
			<outline text="But silly shit like this is just a pimple on the ass of the long- term consequences for politics, art and education.  You have passed a law that will get less respect than the 55 m.p.h. speed limit dead bang in the middle of the First Amendment.  Indecency is nothing but a matter of fashion; obscenity is the same but on a longer timeline.  This generation freely reads James Joyce and Henry Miller and the Republic still stands. The home of the late alleged pornographer D. H. Lawrence is now a beautiful writers' retreat in the mountains above Taos, managed by the University of New Mexico."/>
			<outline text="Universities all have Internet servers, and every English Department has at least one scholar who can read Chaucer's English -- but not on the Internet anymore.  Comparative literature classes might read Boccaccio -- but not on the Internet anymore.  What if some U. S. Attorney hears about Othello and Desdemona &quot;making the beast with two backs&quot; -- is interracial sex no longer indecent anywhere in the country, or is Shakespeare off the Internet?"/>
			<outline text="Did you know you can download video and sound from the Internet? Yes, that means you can watch other people having sex if that is interesting to you, live or on tape.  Technology can make such things hard to retrieve, but probably not impossible.  And since you have swept right past obscenity and into indecency, the baby boomers had better keep their old rock 'n roll tapes off the Internet."/>
			<outline text="When the Jefferson Airplane sang &quot;her heels rise for me,&quot; they were not referring to a dance step.  And if some Brit explains the line about &quot;finger pie&quot; in Penny Lane, the Beatles will be gone.  All of those school boards that used to ban &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; over cussing and spreading the foul lie that kids masturbate can now go to federal court and get that nasty book kept out of cyberspace."/>
			<outline text="But enough about the past.  What about rap music?  No, I do not care much for it either -- any more than I care for the language you shitheads have forced me to use in this essay -- but can you not see the immediate differential impact of this law by class and race?  What is your defense -- that there are no African-Americans on the Internet, since they are too busy pimping and dealing crack?  If our educational establishment has any sense at all, they will be trying to see more teens of all colors on the Internet, because there is a lot to be learned in cyberspace that has nothing to do with sex."/>
			<outline text="There are plenty of young people in this country who have legitimate political complaints.  When you dickheads get done with Social Security, they will be lucky if the retirement age is still in double digits.  But thanks to the wonderful job the public schools have done keeping sex and violence out, we have a lot of intelligent kids who cannot express themselves without indecent language. I have watched lawyers in open court digging their young clients in the ribs every time the word &quot;fuck&quot; slipped out."/>
			<outline text="Let's talk about this fucking indecent language bullshit.  Joe Shea, my editor, does not want it in his newspaper, and I respect that position. He might even be almost as upset about publishing this as I a about writing it.  I do use salty language in my writing, but sparingly, only as a big hammer.  Use the fucking shit too fucking much and it loses its fucking impact -- see what I mean?  Fiction follows different rules, and if you confine your fiction writing to how the swell people want to see themselves using language, you not only preclude literary depiction of most people but you are probably false to the people you purport to depict."/>
			<outline text="Do you remember how real language used by real people got on the air and in the newspapers?  Richard Nixon, while he was president, speaking in the White House about official matters.  A law professor and a nominee for Supreme Court Justice arguing about pubic hairs and porno movies during Senate hearings.  Are these matters now too indecent for the Internet?  How much cleansing will be required of the online news services?  Answer: Enough cleansing to meet the standard of what is appropriate for a child in the most restrictive federal judicial district."/>
			<outline text="This is bullshit -- unconstitutional bullshit and also bad policy bullshit.  To violate your ban on indecency, I have been forced to use  and overuse so-called indecent language.  But if I called you a bunch of goddam motherfucking cocksucking cunt-eating blue-balled bastards with the morals of muggers and the intelligence of pond scum, that would be nothing compared to this indictment, to wit: you have sold the First Amendment, your birthright and that of your children.  The Founders turn in their graves. You have spit on the grave of every warrior who fought under the Stars and Stripes."/>
			<outline text="And what mess of pottage have you acquired in exchange for the rights of a free people?  Have you cleansed the Internet of even the rawest pornography?  No, because it is a worldwide system.  You have, however, handed the government a powerful new tool to harass its critics:  a prosecution for indecent commentary in any district in the country."/>
			<outline text="Have you protected one child from reading dirty words?  Probably not, if you understand what the economists call &quot;substitution&quot; -- but you have leveled the standards of political debate to a point where a history buff would not dare to upload some of the Federalist v. Anti-Federalist election rhetoric to a Website."/>
			<outline text="Since the lobby reporting requirements were not law when the censorship discussion was happening, I hope you got some substantial reward for what you gave up.  Thirty pieces of silver doesn't go far these days."/>

			<outline text="On the other hand..."/>
			<outline text="I wrote my last piece, &quot;Holding Hands in Cyberspace&quot; before I got a look at the new version of the 24 Hours in Cyberspace website."/>
			<outline text="It's a realtime thing, a nicely done site, from a technical standpoint -- but...  "/>
			<outline text="Rick's politics are selling us out!"/>
			<outline text="The home page at http://www.cyber24.com/ has a white background. There is no blue ribbon on the page. On the first content page, a picture taken by Tipper Gore. There are six sections, with introductory pieces written by interesting people. Al Gore! And he isn't talking about freedom of speech on the Internet."/>
			<outline text="Rick sold out. It's so disappointing!"/>
			<outline text="I've been talking with Rick privately and publicly over the last few days. "/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Train in the Distance&quot;, I wrote about Rick without naming him:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;What's more disturbing is how many people I respect are willing to go along with Clinton and Gore on this. I don't care if the Republicans would be worse. I don't care if it's unconstitutional. Clinton is the president of the United States. Remember what that means! Let's be clear that attempted censorship is a crime against humanity, much as attempted murder is serious felony. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;We are offended. It may not be the end. These guys run campaigns. They're here for the long haul. Gore looks good. That man will run for president some day, and he knows it. What is he really saying about us? He looks good, until you look at the truth.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;"/>
			<outline text="I hoped he would read it, and see that his contribution could be a positive one. I talked with him on Tuesday night and asked that he support free speech on the Internet. I told him that it would be OK if Gore was part of the project if he would go on the record about free speech. A blue ribbon is required."/>
			<outline text="I believe selling out is the normal way of doing business in the world that Rick comes from. I've never seen such a clear example. I wanted to believe the best about Rick, I've seen him stand up for what's right, but apparently only when it's easy for him to do so. He may be missing the point. The Internet is about freedom. Until we get sold out. Then it's about sucking up."/>
			<outline text="I said: &quot;The US government is clamping down. Even if the new censorship law isn't widely enforceable, or if it's judged unconstitutional, someone is going to be the test case, and that person will feel like a citizen of Stalinist Russia. The new law imprisons all of us, as it did in Russia, because it causes us to pull back from offending people with political power.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I'm sorry I pointed my readers at his site. It's a vestige of an old way of doing business. When we vote Clinton out of office in November we will be voting against the team that Smolan apparently wants to please."/>
			<outline text="I can even appeal to Clinton, at the last minute, to send this bill back to Congress for correction. Fundamental change could happen in 1996. It might be the year when we elect neither a Republican or a Democrat as president of the United States. If it weren't for Perot's incompetence, it might have happened in 1992. And in 1996 we have the Internet as an organizational tool. "/>
			<outline text="So..."/>
			<outline text="There's still time to fix it!"/>
			<outline text="Rick: please take Gore off your site until he's ready to talk about freedom. Switch background colors. And put up a blue ribbon."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/9/96; 9:17:08 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I said: &quot;I'm voting against Clinton in November.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Kyle D. Skrinak, kylesk\@nando.net, said: &quot;Perhaps I missed it, but may I suggest you declare who you intend to support. Outside of a libertarian candidate, I am unfamiliar with which presidential candidate would be against this censorship.&quot;"/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="Fair enough. A lot of people asked that question. And Mr. Skrinak asked it with respect."/>
			<outline text="My answer: I don't know!"/>
			<outline text="I can say I'm going to vote against Clinton without saying who I'm going to vote for. That's my right as a US citizen."/>
			<outline text="It's only February. The US presidential election is in November. There's lots of time. Between now and November the web will grow by an order of magnitude. Try to remember what it looked like in June 1995. It was a sleepy backwater then, even though it looked like a boom. We still have spring, summer and fall before we have to make a choice. Perhaps even Clinton can get my vote. But he's got a bunch of digging (and explaining!) to do."/>
			<outline text="People have also questioned my use of the term &quot;crime against humanity&quot; to describe the attempted censorship of the Internet. People say I'm off here, not in direction, but in scale. They ask how can you compare this act with the other acts that have been called crimes against humanity?"/>
			<outline text="I have two answers. First, it's a felony to leave the scene of an accident, and it's a felony to blow up a Federal courthouse in Oklahoma City. Scale has nothing to do with it. If this isn't a crime against humanity, who is it a crime against? Do we hold our politicians accountable for their actions, especially if they're on a global scale? Are just US citizens offended by their attempt to shut down free speech on the Internet? No. The mail has been coming in from all over the planet. And rightly so. This act has global implications."/>
			<outline text="Second, I made a promise to my grandfather to oppose this kind of shit. I'm a first-generation US citizen. Both sides of my family left Europe, fleeing Hitler, for their lives! I listened to my parents and grandparents. I've read about this stuff. How did Hitler start? How many people said &quot;It can't happen here!&quot; And how sorry were they later, when they couldn't do anything about it but run for their lives. "/>
			<outline text="Well, it's still early, we *can* do something about it. These ideas must meet our resistance. I think it's our obligation, if not to humanity, to evolution and peace. "/>
			<outline text="***It Can Happen"/>
			<outline text="Saying it's unconstitutional is like saying it can't happen here. You're trusting something that might not be trustworthy. "/>
			<outline text="A year ago, when the Exon amendment was first discussed, did you think that Congress could pass such a bill? It can happen. Did you think that Clinton would sign it? It happened. Could the courts go along with it? Hmmm. Could people go to jail? What do *you* think?"/>
			<outline text="The opposition is incredibly well financed and organized. According to the EFF they're distributing kits to federal prosecutors all over the country, teaching them how to prosecute under the new censorship law. They're going to make hay while the sun shines. Maybe the law is unconstitutional. Maybe the courts will say so. But for now, it's on the books, it's the law of the land. Can you go to jail for your opinions in the USA? According to the law -- yes. Some of us will go to jail. I think we know that now."/>
			<outline text="Hey -- I'm pissed when I get a jury duty notice. Imagine how it would feel to get arrested for speaking my mind, for writing DaveNet? How would it feel to get convicted and sent to jail? I don't want to find out! I like my life. I want to be free. I don't want to be a prisoner!"/>
			<outline text="I made a promise to my grandfather, but I also made a promise to myself. I thought we had cleansed this kind of crap from our society after Vietnam. We lost a whole generation on that one. Let's not lose another one. "/>
			<outline text="Yes, it can happen here. "/>
			<outline text="It can happen anywhere, anytime. "/>
			<outline text="All it takes is your silence. "/>
			<outline text="Wake up!"/>
			<outline text="***What a day!"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday was a day of great growth for me. It started at 4AM, writing my ode to Rick Smolan, entitled &quot;Holding Hands in Cyberspace&quot;. Then it turns out I was wildly and unrealistically optimistic. I look at Rick's website, there's Al Gore, talking about the fucking environment! I want to believe Rick is a good guy, but the evidence indicates otherwise. I leave him a voicemail, explaining that our thirteen year friendship is in jeopardy. No answer. I feel I've misled my readers. So I retract my support for his project. A few hours later a blue ribbon shows up on his site. Click on it. Nothing happens."/>
			<outline text="Is this good enough? No."/>
			<outline text="I think Rick truly has a good heart. He wants to do the right thing, deep inside. But he didn't do the right thing. "/>
			<outline text="I can't support him. Can you have a friend who you can't support? No. "/>
			<outline text="I said in an email that this is the first time in my life that I didn't sell out for friendship. That's where the growth came from."/>
			<outline text="In the early evening, I spoke with Howard Rheingold, hlr\@well.com. "/>
			<outline text="He encouraged me to work something out with Rick. His magic words were -- &quot;eventually Rick will thank you for doing this.&quot; That gets inside of me, it resonates."/>
			<outline text="Howard is a great writer! I asked him to write something for DaveNet. I asked him to write about his day, yesterday -- his 24 Hours -- something for Rick and others to think about."/>
			<outline text="Here's what Howard said."/>
			<outline text="***Howard Rheingold speaks"/>
			<outline text="I got up this morning and headed for Planet Hollywood, a place I never would have stepped foot in otherwise, to do a panel with Paul Saffo and Esther Dyson. Illustra got this big to-do together weeks ago, as self-promotion leveraged on Rick Smolan's self-promotion. "/>
			<outline text="I thought Rick was doing a pretty cool thing, bringing people's attention to some of the pleasant and beneficial things happening in cyberspace. God knows we need as much of that as possible to counter the hysteria whipped up by Ralph Reed and buddies. Illustra seems like a cool product. Empowers people to publish. And they paid me."/>
			<outline text="This morning turned out, through one of those weird accidents that history hands you, the day of the Web blackout. I blacked out my main page before I headed out this morning."/>
			<outline text="The Illustra thing, frankly, was one of the biggest wasted opportunities I've ever seen. They did a great job getting a couple hundred interesting people together and then put on a boring blah-blah for hours."/>
			<outline text="Then came the panel. I always take the opportunity to seize the subject and wrench it over to how the fuck are we going to look our children in the eyes ten years from now when they ask us what we were doing while a bunch of tiny-minded puritan fascists shat on liberties that Americans have died for. I think some people woke up. At least they said so. I hope I gave them something to talk about. I feel fine about the bux I took from Illustra to do the gig.  And I felt fine about helping Illustra promote 24 Hours promote Illustra. Until I read my Davemail tonight."/>
			<outline text="Rick. Be a journalist. You are the last hope on an ugly day."/>
			<outline text="American journalists, with a few exceptions should hang their heads in shame. I'm one of the guys who gets the calls for the quotes and soundbites. For years. Ever since this Internet stuff started heating up. I've done ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, BBC, NHK. I've done German, French, Austrian, Italian, Australian TV. I've given the quotes to the reporters from the New York Times, Washington Post, L.A. Times, and a hundred podunk papers. And every goddamn sound bite about democracy hits the cutting room floor and is replaced by the same idiotic shtick about cyberporn or sexual predators in chat rooms. Over and over again. For years."/>
			<outline text="I have asked reporters whether they care about the kind of country their children grow up in. I literally got down on my knees and begged the last CBS crew that came out here. The reporters and field producers are sincere. There is some asshole sitting in LA or New York whose job it is to kill the stuff that isn't as shallow as a tin pan full of cold dogpiss, and substitute some off-the-rack sleaze."/>
			<outline text="There is a code of ethics for journalists, and right up there at the top is a reminder that the press in a free society has an obligation to inform citizens about events that affect our freedom. Well, journalism is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of entertainment, and these journalists have loaded the shotgun, handed it to their enemies, dropped their trousers, bent over, and put the muzzles in their own asses. I believe most of the editors and producers who failed us so miserably have done it out of cluelessness more than malice or conspiracy or craven sucking-up-to-the-owners."/>
			<outline text="The most important piece of legislation in the past fifty years took a year to work its way through Congress and is now law. A multi-trillion dollar industry has been divvied up. Do any of us know who really won and who really lost? Does anybody know about any of it except the cyberporn stuff? It was a sideshow, a juicy piece of meat to distract the watchdogs of our minds, while the real action took place elsewhere."/>
			<outline text="I've been writing columns about this since 1994. So has Brock. Wired has been on the case. And very few others."/>
			<outline text="It isn't just the politicians who deserve our wrath, the craven cowards. It's the journalists and their bosses."/>
			<outline text="But history handed us this delicious opportunity. After a year of failure to get the attention of the New York Times and CNNs of the world, Rick Smolan, media lubricator extraordinaire, managed to get a lot of attention focused on something happening on the Net that *isn't* sinister."/>
			<outline text="And now Dave Winer tells us that Rick isn't going to acknowledge the Web blackout."/>
			<outline text="Rick, it's this simple. You are a journalist. You chose February 8 as your day to cover. To ignore the anti-CDA protest that is one of the biggest stories on the day you chose to cover months ago is to abrogate the right to ever call yourself a journalist again. "/>
			<outline text="It isn't too late. I know this is a headache you didn't ask for. Sometimes history asks people to make a judgement call at a bad time. Sometimes people regret the decisions they failed to make. We have an opportunity here to use all the attention you have masterfully focused on this event to shed some light. You gotta do it."/>
			<outline text="Acknowledge the protest."/>
			<outline text="***One more screed"/>
			<outline text="The following story has been floating around the net, attributed to Charles Phillip Whitedog. I don't have an email address for Mr. Whitedog. His signature reads &quot;Charles Phillip Whitedog, Ojibway and Network Man; Multimission Ground Systems Office (Mission Control); Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;About 1966 or so, a NASA team doing work for the Apollo moon mission took the astronauts near Tuba City where the terrain of the Navajo Reservation looks very much like the lunar surface. With all the trucks and large vehicles were two large figures that were dressed in full Lunar spacesuits."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Nearby, a Navajo sheep herder and his son were watching the strange creatures walk about, occasionally being tended by personnel.  The two Navajo people were noticed and approached by the NASA personnel. Since the man did not know English, his son asked for him what the strange creatures were and the NASA people told them that they are just men that are getting ready to go to the moon. The man became very excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The NASA personnel thought this was a great idea so they rustled up a tape recorder. After the man gave them his message they asked his son to translate. His son would not."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Later, they tried a few more people on the reservation to translate and every person they asked would chuckle and then refuse to translate. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Finally, with cash in hand, someone translated the message: 'Watch out for these guys, they come to take your land.'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***I felt sorry for him!"/>
			<outline text="I did eventually talk with Rick, and at 10:30PM I drove to San Francisco to get my picture taken by him, and to chat with some of the people doing the &quot;24 Hours in Cyberspace&quot; project. Rick had been up for 36 hours. You could tell. Look in his eyes. He's barely standing up. I felt sorry for him!"/>
			<outline text="We don't understand each other. Yes, there is a blue ribbon on the 24 Hours website. Cooool -- kind of. But it doesn't go anywhere, it's not a link. It's just a picture. "/>
			<outline text="And in that I think we have the perfect metaphor for Rick's project. "/>
			<outline text="Smolan could be an online journalist if he wants to be one. By an accident of history, he could have been a *great* online journalist. In a real sense, the first one. Welcome Rick! I said in &quot;Holding Hands in Cyberspace&quot;."/>

			<outline text="***No-shows"/>
			<outline text="There were some remarkable missing statements from people and companies you'd think would want to take a stand. "/>
			<outline text="Almost all the major software and online companies had nothing to say. Adobe, America Online, Apple, Borland, CompuServe, DEC, General Magic, IBM, Illustra, Lotus, Macromedia, Metrowerks, Microsoft, Oracle, Pointcast, Sun, UUNET were all business as usual."/>
			<outline text="Some Ziff publications are black, have blue ribbons, and point to the EFF page. Some even have editorial copy of their own. CNN has a very strong statement saying they won't stand on either side of the issue. I've gotten lots of mail on the CNN position."/>
			<outline text="None of the venture capitalist websites had anything to say about freedom of speech on the Internet, but many of the companies they invest in had something to say.  "/>
			<outline text="Of the Internet search engines, only http://www.webcrawler.com/ makes a statement."/>
			<outline text="***How I looked"/>
			<outline text="I visited places I thought of. I have a glossary of all the sites I've written about, I started there. I went to WebCrawler's top-25 sites. I used the VC websites as starting places, visited their portfolios. I wanted to check out the EFF board members, but they don't have links to the personal websites on the EFF site. "/>
			<outline text="I used my bookmarks file. I used the EFF blue ribbon page and the Voters Telecomm Watch page. I looked at my friend's websites. &quot;Alta Vista&quot;!"/>
			<outline text="About halfway thru the morning I wrote some scripts so that I could just press one keystroke in Netscape, type comments into a dialog, and go onto the next site. It got a lot easier."/>
			<outline text="Then I saw two sites that really made a difference for me. I smiled when I saw http://java.sun.com/. Web energy is alive at JavaSoft! Cooool. I had already been to Sun's corporate page -- no statement there. "/>
			<outline text="Then I saw Netscape's site. Zooooooom! I think that was a pivotal point in my life."/>

No writer is interest-free. Freedom is their first interest. That's what editorial pages are for. PC Magazine, http://www.zdnet.com/~pcmag/ did it exactly right. "/>

Check out their coverage of the Telecom Act, their celebration of 24 Hours in Cyberspace. I think this trip should be required reading for every freedom-loving webmaster, webwriter and web user. "/>

			<outline text="I've learned that when I want to really understand what's going on, don't look to an Act of God as the explanation, when it's more likely just an error in logic."/>
			<outline text="The truth: the media people have learned how to use the net and to combine it with TV, radio and print media."/>
			<outline text="They're transferring the power structures in their world to the web world. "/>
			<outline text="If we want real change, now is the time to make an investment in democracy on the Internet."/>
			<outline text="Every voice can be heard. Our ideas speak for us. We can persuade, cajole, taunt, seduce, use logic, examine all aspects of a problem, learn, be angry, be scared, and then find the most eloquent statement, the one that resonates deepest within all of us. "/>

			<outline text="Talk about it with your friends. Share ideas. Listen. "/>
			<outline text="When you're ready, post your essay to the web. If you don't have a website, check out the Sponsors page at the 24 Hours website. I'm enlisting the help of service providers. We may have an easy way for people who don't have sites to get their essays posted to the web."/>
			<outline text="Shortly after the start time I'll mail a DaveNet piece telling you where to send the URL for your page. "/>
			<outline text="The styling of the page is entirely up to you. There's a Template page on the 24 Hours site, the URL is at the bottom of this email. I suggest using a white background for easy reading, and to contrast the black backgrounds of last week. Use animated GIFs. RealAudio. Java applets. Shockwave parts. JavaScript banners. Near the bottom of the page, put some keywords about yourself, where you are geographically, your email address. Web crawlers will be able to extract this information and index it. Follow the example in the template if possible."/>
			<outline text="At the top of your page, create three links, Next, Prev and Index. After the 24 Hours database is compiled, a few days after the end time, we'll send you a mail message containing the addresses to fill into each of these pointers. Next and Prev will point to essays written by other 24 Hours participants. The Index link will point to a home page for the whole project."/>
			<outline text="Essays will not be judged or reviewed. You own your own words, and are responsible for what you write."/>
			<outline text="***Who can help"/>
			<outline text="Moms &amp; Dads: Ask your kids how they feel about the Internet. Have they made new friends? What have they learned? Did the Internet ever scare them? Make some quiet time. Listen."/>
			<outline text="Teachers: This would make a great homework assignment for your students."/>
			<outline text="Webmasters: You have to seduce people into caring about this stuff. Convey your excitement to people you work with. It's not just about pornography, it's about freedom. Point them to &quot;Netscape&quot;'s home page. Ask them to read your essay. Create a page of pointers to their essays."/>
			<outline text="Computer users: Be a visionary! What kind of software would you like to see coming from the software industry over the next few years?"/>
			<outline text="Graphic artists: We need colorful schemes, a simple message, low bandwidth art with commercial appeal."/>
			<outline text="Celebrities, political leaders: Do you have something to say?"/>
			<outline text="Editorial organizations: Can you review essays and choose the most compelling ones or the most interesting ones? "/>
			<outline text="Online companies: We need mail, web and database servers; search engines. Can you make it easier for your users to get a single page up on your server? Can you assist them in registering their pages on Wednesday? Can you give them a discount, or provide free storage for their essays? Bandwidth, support and free service to participants is what counts."/>
			<outline text="Everyone: Have fun! That's what this is about. Be creative. As soon as it stops being fun we stop growing, and that's the end. Be positive!"/>
			<outline text="***Only 42 hours left"/>

			<outline text="Here's why!"/>
			<outline text="***Why am I working on a Sunday morning?"/>
			<outline text="We're at a crossroads for the Internet medium. Will it be a narrow-channel one-way medium as the east coast media people glibly claim it will be? Soap commercials, sensationalism, imitation friendship -- a continuation of the suburban culture of isolation, lies, dysfunction and unhappiness?"/>
			<outline text="Or will it be the medium of &quot;Great Hair&quot;? Of speaking and being heard?"/>
			<outline text="They're telling us to shut up! The chill is real. What are you prepared to do about it?"/>
			<outline text="***I've made a proposal"/>
			<outline text="I decided to do something about it. I believe every voice makes a difference. I believe in the power of the Internet. It just needs a bit of organization. It needs someone to stick his or her neck out first. "/>
			<outline text="I listened to Howard Rheingold when he asked what we will tell our children ten years from now. I listened to Howard and I heard him. It gives me a chill! What *will* we tell them? "/>
			<outline text="Speaking for your kids, Mom and Dad -- what were you doing the week of February 18, 1996 that you couldn't spare some space on your home page, or spare a few hours to write down your own thoughts about freedom of speech?"/>
			<outline text="If not for the rest of us, do it for your kids. Write them a letter and put it in a time capsule. Show them later what you stood for today."/>
			<outline text="People want to be spoon-fed. They're looking for mommy! I think the kids have more guts than us adults do. It's their future we're fighting for. Do you care enough to get involved? It's time to grow up. The opportunity is great, but so is the threat."/>
			<outline text="No one spoon-fed the founders of our country. They fought a revolution for our right to free speech. You don't have to die for freedom, at least not yet. You just have to say you're in favor of it. A right that's not practiced is lost. Once it's gone, you *will* have to die to get it back, or worse, your kids will have to die!"/>
			<outline text="It's really simple. On February 22, everyone who cares about freedom, write an essay so everyone can see it. I don't care if you agree with me. It isn't a Dave Winer fan club. It's about numbers and voters. This is a two-way medium. We need to demonstrate that before it's too late."/>
			<outline text="Companies like Microsoft and Netscape have a stake in the two-way-ness of this medium. Microsoft has FrontPage and Netscape has Navigator Gold. Both products are based on the assumption that lots of people will speak thru the worldwide web."/>
			<outline text="But is it safe to do speak in this medium -- to really speak your mind -- if the community standards of Memphis US apply to the writing of people in Paris FR? Judges in the US are deciding that every community's standards apply to every bit of writing on the web! Man. Talk about a chilling idea."/>
			<outline text="How much do French people know about Tennessee? How much do they *want* to know? That's not a joke!"/>
			<outline text="They say it can't happen here. Over and over. It can. It's happening!"/>
			<outline text="Look, I'm angry with Bill Clinton for putting us in bed with the bible-thumpers. I feel very strongly about this. You may think Clinton did the right thing. Say so. Thanks to the work of some very fine people, it's easy to get your ideas on the web -- this week. Take advantage of this opportunity to really speak your mind. You may not get another chance."/>
			<outline text="***Today's proposal: Webmasters"/>
			<outline text="As the week goes by I will have more proposals. Today's message is directed at webmasters -- people who manage websites."/>
			<outline text="Please learn about the 24 Hours project. "/>
			<outline text="It's totally non-commercial. We will share all the software we've developed for the project. There won't be any ads on this site."/>
			<outline text="Browse around the website. Listen to me, then listen to your heart. Does free speech belong on your home page? Does your site support democracy? If so, link to the 24 Hours website so your users know where you stand. If you decide to link in at the last minute, say February 21, your users will complain that they didn't have enough time to prepare their essays. And they will be right!"/>
			<outline text="Honestly, right now, Sunday morning, the project looks like a failure. We've attracted some honest hardworking people who really care. The site you're looking at is a group effort. We had fun doing it. It was hard work for a good cause. I will be able to sleep knowing that I did everything I could for the cause of free speech. What about you?"/>
			<outline text="Dear webmaster, if you have to sell this inside your company -- sell it! Your president will thank you later, as Bud Colligan of Macromedia thanked me a few days ago. You can't afford to not stand up for free speech on the Internet."/>
			<outline text="Your future, my future, their shareholder's future, the next generation's future -- they all depend on what you do right now."/>
			<outline text="No, I'm not too proud to beg."/>
			<outline text="So webmasters, I'm down on my hands and knees, begging -- get behind the 24 Hours of Democracy project! Today. "/>

			<outline text="Here's his essay which is part of the 24 Hours of Democracy project."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Support Freedom of Speech on the Internet"/>
			<outline text="The Internet is the first medium that allows anyone with reasonably inexpensive equipment to publish to a wide audience. It is the first medium that distributes information globally at almost no marginal cost. "/>
			<outline text="The Internet's potential is enormous, and the stakes are high. The Internet can raise the quality of political debate, the quality of education, the quality of life. It is precious and important, and we must not take it for granted. "/>
			<outline text="Beginning two decades ago, the PC industry developed in the United States without government control and regulations. The benefits of the resulting PC revolution were far-reaching. "/>
			<outline text="As this computer revolution gives way to an even-more-important communications revolution, governments are getting involved - sometimes with a vengeance. "/>
			<outline text="One example of government involvement is the telecommunications- deregulation bill that President Bill Clinton recently signed into law. It will, among other things, make the &quot;information highway&quot; of the future possible. "/>
			<outline text="Overall, Microsoft and I supported this legislation, in part because it will help create a framework that will encourage aggressive private investment. The result will be faster communications connections and lower costs for people who use interactive networks such as the Internet. This will be good for our economy and way of life. "/>
			<outline text="But not everything about the bill is good. In fact, one part is truly bad. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft and others in industry and non-profit organizations were deeply involved in trying to block language that would put chilling restrictions on the use of the Internet for the free publication of information. The language, ostensibly aimed at keeping pornography out of the hands of children, goes much too far in restricting freedom of expression. "/>
			<outline text="We had a lot of good company in the fight against this knee-jerk language, but we lost the first round. "/>
			<outline text="Now our hope is that this misguided language will either be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional or else overridden legislatively. "/>
			<outline text="If it is allowed to stand, it will undermine our nation's Bill of Rights -- and there is no question that it will interfere with the ability of the Internet to flourish. It is so restrictive that it will scare people who fear they might commit a felony, by simply discussing a controversial topic. "/>
			<outline text="We in the United States have a heartfelt interest in keeping pornography and other objectionable material out of the hands of children. We can't turn our heads and ignore that which can damage our kids. "/>
			<outline text="But we also have a national interest in freedom of expression. Throughout history, that freedom has been a hallmark of our nation which has benefited our society, and helped us set an example for the world. "/>
			<outline text="The free exchange of ideas on a global basis is something that is important for the U.S. politically and economically. Let's not undermine the world-wide trend toward free expression by setting a bad example when it comes to free speech on a computer network. "/>
			<outline text="The Bill of Rights is the foundation on which our nation is built. The Internet is an enormously valuable place in which those rights must continue to thrive. Both the Bill of Rights and the Internet are potentially fragile. Mess with either of them too much, and we might ruin them. "/>
			<outline text="We can't let this happen. "/>

			<outline text="***Did we miss your essay?"/>
			<outline text="I'm totally buzzing with ideas from the 24 Hours project. "/>
			<outline text="Every time I think I have a perspective on it, that I'm ready to write, something changes and blows all my expectations out of the water."/>
			<outline text="So I'll write now, and try to catch up later.  An example. This morning when I got up, there's a newly registered page from The Well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.well.com/confteam/staffstatements/&quot;&gt;Go there&lt;/a&gt;. It's a policy statement from the company. Very nice! There's a list of Well employees who signed the statement. Many are links. I go there. Personal statements about freedom of speech! "/>
			<outline text="This page was a surprise. Until this morning I didn't even know it existed. It wasn't linked into the chain of 963 web pages that are holding hands as part of the 24 Hours of Democracy project. "/>
			<outline text="We learned a lot. Don't do page registrations via email. A web form works much better. There were pages that didn't get registered. "/>
			<outline text="There were glitches. Interesting ones -- it seems that mail from &quot;CompuServe&quot; to &quot;America OnLine&quot; bounces. That's not cool! "/>
			<outline text="So we've put into service a new set of CGI scripts and a database to catch registrations we missed. "/>
			<outline text="Check it out: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotwired.com/userland/24/didwemissyouressay.html&quot;&gt;Did we miss your essay?&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="By the way, it's OK to register pages for other people. Enter your email address in the form. When the reply comes back, help the page's author get linked into the chain. It's a buddy system. Sometimes that's the only way it can work. "/>
			<outline text="An example, I'm going to help Bill Gates link his essay into the chain by working with the webmasters at Microsoft. It's a web-based way for me to thank Microsoft for supporting free speech on the Internet. I'm glad to do the same for other leaders of the online industry. Let me know."/>
			<outline text="***The AIDS quilt"/>
			<outline text="AIDS is a terrible thing. A challenge to the human race. It could be our end, we don't know. And if it isn't, AIDS just tells us that we got lucky this time. "/>
			<outline text="Shouldn't we be seriously thinking about a backup for the human race? Maybe AIDS is the stimulus we need to establish colonies on the moon and perhaps other planets or in other solar systems."/>
			<outline text="I don't equate the attempted censorship of the Internet with the threat of AIDS, but it's the same kind of thing, on a different scale. "/>
			<outline text="Links are different from TV. 24 Hours is state of the art in linking. To my knowledge, it's the first time anyone has tried to deliberately distribute such a large set of websites. It's a systematic way to refer to each other. It's already a very complex structure and it's only been three days! When will it be finished? Will it run out of steam? It's impossible to know."/>
			<outline text="It's been suggested on various sites that this is the Internet's equivalent of the &quot;AIDS quilt&quot;. If so, the 24 Hours name is going to be the wierdest joke. The process started in a hailstorm of activity in a 24 Hour period. But the quilt will keep growing and growing, channeling opinion, feelings and people, and creating new connections between them."/>
			<outline text="These are real people, not Roseanne, Homer, Picard or Butthead. They have lives."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="It's a parade of humanity. In that way it's very much like the AIDS quilt."/>
			<outline text="It's tragic that something as negative as censorship has to intersect with something as young as the Internet. But in all struggles there is beauty. "/>
			<outline text="The writers of the 24 Hours project are struggling to make sense of it, that's why the result is so beautiful."/>
			<outline text="***R E S P E C T"/>
			<outline text="We asked for respect, universal respect and self-respect. The four-letter-words and black backgrounds that were so common on the web earlier this month seem to be a vestige. They reflected the immediate wound that happened. "/>
			<outline text="There are quite a few nasty words in the DaveNet pieces I wrote in early February. I'm leaving them on the record. "/>
			<outline text="The wound is older now, and the anger is being replaced with a desire to solve the problem and move on."/>
			<outline text="I have decided to reject censorship. But that doesn't mean I can't practice respect."/>
			<outline text="That theme, respect, is repeated over and over, in the vast majority of the essays."/>
			<outline text="***It's a teenage thing"/>
			<outline text="Some of the best writing comes from teenagers. They know how to answer questions, and they speak honestly. They write essays in school. Why not post their ideas on the Internet? They have time. They have ideas. And they have the biggest stake in the future."/>
			<outline text="As I read their essays I heard over and over how adults don't get the Internet. They make rules that don't make sense. The kids are frustrated. It rings true. I remember, when I was a teenager, I observed the same thing."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I trust these kids, and I care what they have to say. "/>
			<outline text="We don't have a Teenage Tour linked into the 24 Hours site yet, but I want one. "/>
			<outline text="***It's a feminine thing"/>
			<outline text="No one has collected statistics, nor is it clear that it's possible to. But it *seems* like a lot of the pages are from women. Maybe more than half. In earlier DaveNet pieces I predicted that the biggest change coming for the net is more and more contributions from women. Feminine energy flowing onto the web. I think we're seeing it happen now."/>
			<outline text="***It's an Ant Farm!"/>
			<outline text="Use the &quot;Reading the Essays&quot; page to visit sites. "/>
			<outline text="Set aside a couple of hours sometime in the next few of days. "/>
			<outline text="Or do it tonight, instead of watching 60 Minutes. "/>
			<outline text="It's an amazing thing to watch. It's like an Ant Farm! It's impossible to get all the sites you like into your Bookmarks menu. Just bounce around. You'll see the best use of audio and animation. Neat web tricks. And the best writing I've ever seen."/>
			<outline text="***The World's Fair"/>
			<outline text="It's a World's Fair for the web. This project has captured the next level of growth. It's a collaborative evolving structure of people, doing what I had hoped could happen -- they're holding each other's hands. Speaking and listening. Learning. And spreading the word."/>

			<outline text="During the German occupation, the French sometimes had been more diligent promoters of the Holocaust than the Germans themselves. Few Jewish families survived. "/>
			<outline text="In the 60s Jewish Children weren't welcome in French Schools. In my school most of the parents of the Jewish children were hard working cabinet makers, tailors or carpenters. They worked to get their children an education."/>
			<outline text="For most of the Jewish families, France had been their homes for no more than a generation. At the turn of the Century, they migrated from Eastern Europe, usually arriving with no more than a shirt on their backs, their violins and clarinets. And the great hope from a new lease on life. It lasted a short while. "/>
			<outline text="In my school,in the heart of Paris, out of several thousand kids there were a handful of us. We were different. We were kept apart. The neighborhoods were pretty rough. We got together and practiced boxing and martial arts. It was self defense."/>
			<outline text="Often we'd come home bruised, our clothes ripped. "/>
			<outline text="One day they had posters in the neighborhood, inviting kids to join the &quot;keepers of the Great Aryan Principles&quot;. About ten kids, part of a neo-Nazi group, were holding a meeting and explaining how the Holocaust never happened and why it was another fabrication of the Jews. "/>
			<outline text="That was too much. Three of us decided to go and present a counter-argument. They didn't see it that way. They beat us up with steel bars and kicked us with their combat boots. "/>
			<outline text="I came back home with a broken nose, limping and bruises all over my body. "/>
			<outline text="When my Mother arrived, I was furious. I told her how it was unbelievable to see people expressing such lies and insults. How they should not be allowed to publicize their opinions. How we should appeal to the highest authorities to stop them from publicizing those lies."/>
			<outline text="She looked at me, listened. As she sat down at the table, I stared at the tattoos on her forearm: Unerasable memories of the years she had spent in the Death Camps and that she had miraculously survived. "/>
			<outline text="She looked me straight in the eyes and said: &quot;For Centuries our people have been the victims of intolerance. The price of our freedom is the burden of having to accept the worst in public expression. For he who starts censorship will never know where and when to stop.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="A comment..."/>
			<outline text="It's interesting that many of the essays from adults tell stories from their childhood. And we got lots of stories from children."/>
			<outline text="I like this because the opposition in this argument has effectively used children to alienate people from the Internet, inaccurately painting it as an indecent land of pornography. The truth is that children participate on the net. We get to hear what's going on, and we're interested! "/>
			<outline text="How are kids supposed to interpret the rules of the Telecom Act? Hmmm. "/>
			<outline text="Congresspeople, the President, with all due respect, how would you explain this censorship to *your* children?"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/1/96; 8:12:12 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="My friend Sylvia says that DaveNet is my personal journal. How true! When I want to remember what I was doing in a given month I can just open up the DaveNet website and have a look. All the memories come spilling back! It's cooool."/>
			<outline text="This week I had a personal experience. Called for jury duty. Courtroom, jury box. Judge, clerk, bailiff, stenographer. The People point a finger! The defense rises, the defense rests. We talk, we're locked. We come back. Talk, compromise, decide. Guilty! Return to normal life."/>
			<outline text="I had been called before, but had never served. This time I had no hardship to argue. My financial future wouldn't be threatened. I'm a writer, my raw material is experience. I was probably the only juror who could stay on the job doing jury duty."/>
			<outline text="At the end of the trial, the judge lifted our gag order. I told my fellow jurors I'd be writing about this. I'm not sure if any of them will see this report. I hope they will."/>
			<outline text="***Doing my job"/>
			<outline text="It's a driving-under-the-influence case. A hundred candidates. They interview each of us. "/>
			<outline text="Almost everyone wishes they didn't have to serve. If you insist, they will let you off. "/>
			<outline text="I'm a magazine writer and software developer. I have experience with drunk driving, I was in a horrible car accident as a child. A drunk driver was responsible. Would this interfere with my ability to make a decision? Honest answer: absolutely not."/>
			<outline text="A doctor's wife, married 55 years. The judge asks what's the secret? One day at a time."/>
			<outline text="A man who is obviously an alcoholic. He sometimes drives after having a few drinks, but it's not a problem, because he doesn't drink too much. He's excused, immediately."/>
			<outline text="***The trial"/>
			<outline text="The trial starts. The courtroom is a respectful place. The judge is our teacher. A deadpan face. No emotion shows. The attorneys treat him with incredible respect. Your honor, may I do this? May I do that?"/>
			<outline text="The job of the court is to teach the jurors how to do their job. It isn't so much about the facts, in the end, it's about impressions. They train us to be jurors. They evoke our emotions, our experiences. They spin us, this way and then that way. Three perspectives offered: pro, con and justice."/>
			<outline text="Each time we file in and out of the courtroom the district attorney rises to greet each of us. I avoid eye contact. We've been instructed by the judge not to communicate with the attorneys.  "/>
			<outline text="Both attorneys lie to us in their opening and closing remarks. I catch them playing with our minds. I wonder if the other jurors catch on. I wonder what tricks I might be missing. I try to make eye contact while they're speaking. Can't do it!"/>
			<outline text="It's like a political debate, with no time limits. They go on and on. My head nods. I wonder if lawyers know that they're such hypnotic speakers? Yes, I believe they know this. I find it ironic that so much of the process is designed to put you to sleep. Could we safely and prudently operate a motor vehicle in this mode? No way."/>
			<outline text="I have seen so many courtroom dramas on TV. It's startling to realize that I am the jury this time! Have you ever driven an English car? Until you sit on the other side, you don't realize how much you depend on the rear-view mirror. Same in a courtroom. On TV your perspective is inside a camera. I'm watching this case from a different perspective. Where's the jury? Uhhh. Wow! It's inside of me. "/>
			<outline text="Outside the courtroom, family dramas. Parents getting divorced. Lots of yelling. Kids roaming the halls, some playing, some not doing as well. I smile at them. Turn on the high beams! Smile kiddies, there is hope. Please don't give up!"/>
			<outline text="Inside the courtroom I am silent. I never speak or whisper. I feel self-conscious when I look at my watch. It's unusual for me to be silent for so long, but I didn't find it difficult. Surprisingly so."/>
			<outline text="Until the defendent took the stand I was undecided. The defense attorney examines his client. She's intelligent. I tune into body language. Cold. She's not outraged to be here. She never looks at the jury. I try to make eye contact. She's not even in the neighborhood of eye contact. "/>
			<outline text="She's fearful, that makes sense. But it seems that fear is a comfortable thing for her. Her speech patterns become an issue. She says &quot;I always talk in a deliberate fashion.&quot; I agree."/>
			<outline text="She's lying. She's not subtle. But she falls short of calling the other witnesses liars. Was she weaving? The policeman is exaggerating. Did she hit the center divider? She doesn't recall. Ear infections explain her lack of balance. She was very tired. So many explanations. Her credibility is the only issue. And she can't look at us."/>
			<outline text="I grew up around alcoholism, I think I can see it. "/>
			<outline text="I believe the woman was intoxicated. Impaired."/>
			<outline text="We're lucky she didn't kill someone with her car that night. "/>
			<outline text="With all due respect, I am sure she did it."/>
			<outline text="***The deliberation"/>
			<outline text="The judge reads our instructions. Explains what we have to decide. What we're allowed to consider and not consider. The language is fairly plain, but also well-rehearsed. I try to keep up with him, but find myself slipping. I imagined that court cases were fought over every word. The lawyers read along carefully."/>
			<outline text="The bailiff leads us to the jury room. We talk. We go around the room. Everyone talks. Some believe her, most don't. Take a vote. Guilty, 8-to-4. We argue. Lots of yelling! Votes change. Within a couple of hours it's 11-to-1. The judge calls. Let's go home and come back tomorrow. We do."/>
			<outline text="While the trial is going on I barely got to know my fellow jurors. By the time the first two-hour session is over they became my family. Leaving them leaves me with the same sad unresolved emptiness that leaving home, usually in a hailstorm of yelling, used to give me when I was in my teens."/>
			<outline text="The next morning we go over it and over it. Offer the not-guilty-voter a chance to convince the rest of us. We explain in careful detail how each of us arrived at the guilty decision. Silence. We don't know what to say. Someone notices that her license plate is LOV 2SU. Is it a vanity plate? What goes around comes around. We laugh! Ain't it the truth."/>
			<outline text="More silence. Take another vote. It's still 11-to-1. We tell the judge. Break for lunch."/>
			<outline text="As we file out of the courtroom, the door behind the judge's desk is open. He's sitting in a wheelchair! Wow."/>
			<outline text="When we come back from lunch it's still 11-to-1. We vote on it, we're a hung jury. The foreperson prepares the note to tell the judge we're deadlocked. We call in the bailiff. We look at the one. He says he may change his mind. The bailiff goes out, the door closes. He asks us to tell our stories again. We speak softly this time. No yelling. Our stories have evolved. Lots of eye contact. "/>
			<outline text="The vote changes. It's unanimous now. It's not a cheerful moment. But it's a real moment. We write the note. We wait. We talk."/>
			<outline text="Now we find out who we are, what we do. Lots of personal stuff came out during the deliberation. Someone calls me a troublemaker. With an affectionate smile. Right on! Yes ma'am. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="We file back into the courtroom. The verdict doesn't surprise them. "/>
			<outline text="The district attorney stands as we leave, tries to make eye contact."/>
			<outline text="As I drive home, I'm sorry it's over."/>

			<outline text="I took an auto cruise this weekend. Saturday was one of the most beautiful days ever. Clear blue sky. Warm sun. I got a tan! A little. "/>
			<outline text="The hills are green after a long winter of rain. Trees are blooming. Flowers everywhere. In the most unlikely places. Daffodils in the median strip of US 101! They're sooo pretty. It seems as if it can never rain again. "/>
			<outline text="I took a week's worth of New York Times with me on the road trip. Late Saturday night, after a shiatsu and a few hours in warm water, it started raining. I caught up."/>
			<outline text="I've become a hound for information about the 1996 US presidential elections. It's a special time; great battles are fought on page 1; great struggles between the fears of various factions."/>
			<outline text="Then I caught an article about Microsoft promoting a ratings system for Internet websites. They plan to support it in the next version of Internet Explorer. "/>
			<outline text="This story bothered me a lot!"/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft Tries to Get a Life"/>
			<outline text="I think people in New York and Washington think that Microsoft gets the web."/>
			<outline text="Wrong! They're learning. They're trying hard. Pedal to the metal. "/>
			<outline text="Imagine Steve Ballmer at a Microsoft pep rally, screaming &quot;LEARN THE INTERNET OR DIE!&quot; I think I had a dream about this once? Maybe not."/>
			<outline text="Imagine two women talking about their boyfriends. &quot;He's clueless,&quot; the first woman says. The other says &quot;Yes, but at least he's trying.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="We can say that about Microsoft on the web."/>
			<outline text="For the most part they don't have a clue."/>
			<outline text="But at least they're trying!"/>
			<outline text="***Bad Bad Microsoft!"/>
			<outline text="Imagine that a rating system applied to telephone conversations."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Hi Mom! I'm having a great time at college.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Hi Dear! I'm so glad you called!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Mom, before I go any further, I have to tell you that this phone conversation is rated PG-13. There will be no nudity in this phone call. I will not excrete any body fluids while we talk. I will pretend I have no feelings. I'll be smiling a lot!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="A web address will be your phone number. A ratings system means nothing in this world. A website is like a collection of phone calls. "/>
			<outline text="This is a democratic medium. Billions of people will have websites. "/>
			<outline text="Ever wonder why children can be so bored with adults? Maybe it's because we so rarely say anything interesting to them. But maybe the 1-in-a-million kid will read one of my pieces and zooom ahead of his or her generation? Cure cancer or AIDS? Write some great software? I think I'm a good teacher. I believe every kid should have the opportunity to learn from this adult."/>
			<outline text="So Microsoft asks me to make a decision. Choose to be accessible to children and submit to censorship. The other choice is to continue as-is, and accept an implicit triple-x rating. Admit to being a pornographer! "/>
			<outline text="The choice: be controlled or be a pornographer."/>
			<outline text="Huh?"/>
			<outline text="How did this happen?"/>
			<outline text="***No"/>
			<outline text="The answer is no."/>
			<outline text="Bill and Bill -- you can't touch me there!"/>
			<outline text="That's a bad place!"/>
			<outline text="The web is not a broadcast medium."/>
			<outline text="There will be a billion websites."/>
			<outline text="A rating system is a nasty idea."/>
			<outline text="I am not a pornographer."/>
			<outline text="I will not be controlled."/>
			<outline text="Get a clue."/>
			<outline text="***At least he's trying"/>
			<outline text="In his 24 Hours of Democracy essay, Bill Gates said: &quot;The Internet is the first medium that allows anyone with reasonably inexpensive equipment to publish to a wide audience.&quot; YES! "/>
			<outline text="Focus on that idea. This is where desktop publishing was leading. This is where LAN technology from Novell was headed. dBASE, FoxPro, Access. This is why Microsoft was doing Windows and Word and Excel; so that when this transformation took place, when PC users became a medium, that Microsoft would be in position to sell them the new software they'd need."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft could definitely make a contribution to the orderly growth of the Internet, by supplying software."/>
			<outline text="But Microsoft won't figure out what software to supply until they participate in the web, along with their users, on a personal level."/>
			<outline text="***How to turn the corner"/>
			<outline text="Rarely is an answer so obvious. Here's how Microsoft can turn the corner."/>
			<outline text="Put the people of Microsoft on the worldwide web. Family pictures, links to their favorite websites, personal statements, favorite music, their stories. Updating as their lives change. Everyone including Bill Gates, Bob Herbold, Paul Maritz, Pete Higgins and Nathan Myrhvold, with all the associations, departments, frisbee teams, products, tradeshow booths, all represented in a structure of web links. Microsoft's website should showcase the people of Microsoft. The site should contain lots of pointers outside of http://www.microsoft.com/."/>
			<outline text="At first the software is going to be awkward. Tweak and refine it to fit their needs. Personal tools, scaled to all levels of sophistication -- that's the software that needs to be made. Like personal computers in the early days, websites come in thru the back door. It's not a corporate sell. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft will get to know itself in a way it never could before. So will the rest of the world. And this would get Microsoft's energy to flow in the same direction as the market it wants to serve. "/>
			<outline text="***A space program"/>
			<outline text="Proposals like the ratings system only burn braincells, and plant a stake in the ground far behind the line of progress. It's the low-growth road. And it supports censorship. It's a bad idea."/>
			<outline text="The web isn't just a new medium, it's a new space. We need a space program. Not Sesame Street."/>
			<outline text="***The New York Times website"/>
			<outline text="I grew up with the Times. I read it every morning as a child. Then I left New York, but I stayed with the Times. I look to them for leadership, especially on issues of journalism and freedom."/>
			<outline text="Maybe I missed it. Has The Times run an editorial about freedom of speech on the Internet? Does journalism belong on the web? Should we accept a ratings system? Did you accept one for print journalism? "/>
			<outline text="I believe a statement from the editors of the New York Times should be linked to the home page of the Times website, http://www.nytimes.com/, especially if they're going to continue to run articles that support censorship."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Another suggestion for the Times website. I want to point to Times articles from my pieces, but their back-issue service costs $1.95 per article and isn't on the air yet. I also hesitate to point into the Times site because it requires a username and password login. When I go thru a link I like to just bounce over there, have a look, and then bounce back. A Times jump has an extra bounce to it. Breaks the flow. And I have to tell you it costs money to go there. Too much trouble."/>

			<outline text="It's always this way. The radio starts talking about an old person. The thought forms -- he's gone. Then two sentences later, the news, George is gone. "/>
			<outline text="George Burns made it to 100, but not 101."/>
			<outline text="The man had class! He loved Gracie. When she died, many years ago, he said it helped him to sleep in her bed. On 60 Minutes last night they showed George visiting Gracie's grave at Forest Lawn Cemetary in Los Angeles. He thought of everything in terms of showbiz. &quot;She'll always get top billing in my heart,&quot; George said."/>
			<outline text="I wanted to do something special for the passing of George Burns, so I went to &quot;Alta Vista&quot;. Found a bunch of quotes. They're all great! "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Too bad all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxi cabs or cutting hair.&quot; Yeah! That fit the theme of the 24 Hours project, so I added a George Burns page to the site at http://www.hotwired.com/userland/24/."/>
			<outline text="In one of my favorite movies, &quot;Oh, God!&quot;, Burns plays god, of course, but he's a very sensible god. He wants us to love each other and take care of each other. Stop looking to god to make everything right, it already *is* right. "/>

			<outline text="***Mathematics with the weather"/>
			<outline text="Last Tuesday I took a walk with a friend. We talked mathematics. What's an identity? It's different from saying A equals B. It's saying that A *is* B. This isn't just a heavenly day. This *is* heaven. Yayuh."/>
			<outline text="Yes the weather here in California has been brilliant. Hot and humid. Reminds me of east coast summers, childhood feelings, the good stuff! I delayed gardening this year based on last year's experience. There may still be a cold spell, but in a couple of weeks it'll be warm for good. Summer is just around the corner on this March morning and I'm liking it!"/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft around the corner"/>
			<outline text="Look for a big blast of publicity from Microsoft this week. New web browser. Java applets, Netscape plugins, Visual Basic scripts. And JavaScript scripts with a twist -- you can get to the system thru the OLE interface. Security? Maybe not. Power? For sure. "/>
			<outline text="A little bird whispers that Steve Jobs may be at the Microsoft Developer Conference in San Francisco this week. Jobs says that clients are moving too fast, servers have a lot more to do. I agree. "/>
			<outline text="I will be at the Microsoft conference on Tuesday. If anything interesting happens I'll report on it."/>
			<outline text="***Back in geek mode"/>
			<outline text="I've slowed down on DaveNet writing because I've been doing script writing and webmastering. "/>
			<outline text="I'm taking what I learned in doing &quot;24 Hours of Democracy&quot; and bringing it back to the Macintosh webmaster community. In 24 Hours we linked over 1000 sites together. Not billions  of websites or even thousands, but hundreds. "/>
			<outline text="It's a start. We built a community that didn't depend on broadcast email or a newsgroup. The project was tied together by a Macintosh running at the end of an ISDN line. Lots of sysops and a few scripts and tables and outlines."/>
			<outline text="I believe that as of March 1996, a rational way to do a high-flow website is to serve html pages and gifs from a Unix box close to the Internet backbone and on a wide pipe. "/>
			<outline text="Scripts work great on a Macintosh running WebStar and Frontier, a narrow pipe for the Mac server is OK. In the next system I'm doing the pipe to the Mac server will be even less critical, but the system will depend more heavily on the storage and scripting power of a network of Mac servers."/>
			<outline text="We got a lot of attention with the 24 Hours project. Macintosh servers played a central role. We have a lot of room to grow here. Lots of web servers are Macs. Great authoring tools and publishing networks. Artists and writers use Macs. "/>
			<outline text="A bright future, I see, says this geek. "/>
			<outline text="I wanted people to hear that."/>
			<outline text="***An Infinite Loop?"/>
			<outline text="Apple chose to name their R&amp;D headquarters building One &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ufsia.ac.be/~skimo/jargon/infinite__loop.html&quot;&gt;Infinite Loop&lt;/a&gt;. To those who understand what an infinite loop is, why did they choose this name?"/>
			<outline text="Maybe we can get a clue from the changes that are coming. We haven't heard much yet. Here's what we *have* heard... "/>
			<outline text="Larry Tesler is the new Internet czar at Apple. Tesler is very old school. Not Invented Here. More of the Same. Tesler is a puzzling choice for an important growth area such as the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="Here's how Tesler's Apple works. Developer spots an opportunity. Delivers. Apple announces they're taking over the market. No delivery. Market withers. "/>
			<outline text="To Gil Amelio: Apple should appreciate every software product that ships for the Macintosh. In the past, Tesler has been very picky. This created a major diseconomy. It's why your business and mine are so sick when there are so many Mac users, and so much growth in the software business. "/>
			<outline text="Ask Tesler why Apple is doing Cyberdog. Is he helping Apple's shareholders, spending their money wisely, or holding onto a discredited vision of Apple's role in the Macintosh marketplace?"/>
			<outline text="I'm looking for change at Apple -- an outward perspective that helps flow new products from developers to users without aloof judgement from Apple. More attention to users and products. More air cover for developers, less sniper fire."/>
			<outline text="I've been busy with other things for the last few weeks, and I wanted to give the new Apple management a chance to figure out what kind of change they want. Now they're starting to make changes. I'm listening, but so far it looks like more of the same. Stay tuned."/>

			<outline text="***Great Theater"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday: great theater, stunningly great theater, at the Microsoft developer conference in San Francisco. Walk into the main hall at Moscone. It's dark. People everywhere. The tables fill the main hall! A vast sea of attendees. "/>
			<outline text="I've been here before, it's a grand hall for trade shows. MacWorld Expo. Seybold. Huge display screens draped from the ceiling, as commercial banners are draped during a tradeshow. But today it's dark. An Alsop-like conference, for the masses. Microsoft on stage. Microsoft on the screens. "/>
			<outline text="I sit in the very back, so far away from the stage that the audio and video are out of synch. The speaker's gestures precede the sounds, making their motions seem exaggerated. The more emotive the speaker, the funnier it is! "/>
			<outline text="Steve Jobs was a disappointment. He starts really well, I'm sitting on the edge of my chair, hoping for some of his great confidence to shine. I miss the young Steve Jobs, even though he used to irritate me endlessly. Instead we have Steve sucking up, a Jobs every mother could love. He shows us something that he says is revolutionary, but it's just CGI scripts connecting the web to a database. Maybe the people in the audience were impressed, but I don't think so. Everyone who browses the web understands that some pages are static and some aren't."/>
			<outline text="I'm leafing thru the New York Times while Paul Maritz is on the screen. On the front page of the business section, a deal between America OnLine and Netscape. I breathe a sigh of relief. AOL is still on Microsoft's case. Thanks Steve for tweaking them."/>
			<outline text="Towards the end of Maritz's presentation, a slide announces the deals of the day. Citrix, run by my friend Ed Iacobucci, is on the list.  I'm glad for Ed, he's a sweet guy, and I like it when good guys get a chance. Progressive Networks, the makers of RealAudio, run by ex-Microsoftian Rob Glaser are on the slide. Of course! The deal with Sun is signed, Microsoft is now an official Java licensee. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="All of this is non-controversial; exciting to the people involved for sure, but no breakthrus, no new ideas."/>
			<outline text="Then the great theater started. "/>
			<outline text="AOL and Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="Sitting in a tree. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;A far-reaching strategic partnership.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The earth shakes."/>
			<outline text="Just a little."/>
			<outline text="***Just the facts ma'am"/>
			<outline text="Here's what the AOL deal is about. Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes the offical web browser for AOL users, they distribute it on their disks, presumably AOL develops content that takes advantage of features in Microsoft's browser, but that wasn't clear from the announcement. "/>
			<outline text="AOL stops developing their own web browser. The web community sighs in relief. There were problems supporting AOL's browser. Some people will be glad it's over."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft puts a pointer to AOL's home page in a folder somewhere on the shipping Windows disks. This is the victory that AOL sought last summer when their ire was raised by the bundling of Microsoft Network with Microsoft Windows."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft announces a new architecture for web browser plugins called ActiveX. It's a capsule for containers. It can hold Blackbird stuff, Java stuff, and OLE stuff. I'm sure Microsoft would welcome OpenDoc stuff."/>
			<outline text="It's puzzling that Macromedia has taken responsibility for development of the Mac version of ActiveX. I wonder why Microsoft isn't doing this? In a more rational world Apple would be supporting it too."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft showed us their whole Internet product line. Lots of unfinished business. Their HTML looks pretty funny -- lots of Visual Basic commands! I wonder if I'll ever write web pages that contain VB stuff."/>
			<outline text="No doubt some people will wait for the new pieces to be delivered, especially Microsoft corporate users who are confused by the web. But for the rest of us, it's still business as usual. If Microsoft starts showing up more in server logs, I'll do stuff with their stuff. "/>
			<outline text="Until that happens, Netscape remains the browser I judge my pages in. I'm keeping Microsoft on my desktop, so I can view other people's Microsoft-enabled pages easily. "/>
			<outline text="I'm right where I want to be, saddled between two competent companies trying to get my content to flow their way. "/>
			<outline text="It's a two-party system. "/>
			<outline text="That's the right way to do it."/>
			<outline text="***I may want a Volkswagen"/>
			<outline text="It's impossible for one person to concentrate on all the new ways to do gadgets and animations and worlds for web pages. Shockwave and VRML have the largest share of mind. I may crib content from other people, but I don't plan to learn how to develop for these platforms. "/>
			<outline text="Other innovations like frames are too techy, I don't use them. But I am using tables effectively now."/>
			<outline text="The rate at which designers can incorporate new technology is far less than the rate that the software industry can propose new standards. It's an uphill battle to gain consensus around any of the new proposals. Please pay attention to this. The web world is becoming much like the PC software industry a few years ago. In the end, most of the new proposed standards are irrelevent, and will fall by the wayside. "/>
			<outline text="My belief: it isn't really about technology, it's about dissemination of the web into the hands of the millions of people who are going to do websites over the next few years. "/>
			<outline text="I wish for a Volkswagen of web browsers, something smaller than Netscape 2.0, that just supports basic browsing stuff. A well-crafted user interface. Less than a megabyte of memory. Runs realllly fast! "/>
			<outline text="Then, with that as a target platform, we could craft really easy content tools. An outliner and a text editor and a database, and you're done. Easy accessible webmastering. Not the bewildering space of choices we're seeing now."/>
			<outline text="The vast majority of web pages will continue to use &amp;lt;blockquote&gt; and &amp;lt;b&gt;, add a few gifs, and leave it at that. "/>
			<outline text="The web is still a text medium. Don't miss that."/>
			<outline text="***Java"/>
			<outline text="Even though I am bewildered by all the choices, I probably will get active in Java, or work closely with people who do Java. Of all the proposals for adding code to web pages, Java comes from the easiest vendor to support. Sun provokes little fear in my world. I feel that if pressed to do the right thing, Sun probably will. I see Java as an excellent insurance policy against Microsoft dominance of this area."/>
			<outline text="Developers really do think this way. We all make strategic investments; even those of us who work outside of corporations. "/>

Killer apps drive markets, so one woman or man potentially has a lot of power. As long as you have hope it's a lot more than one-man one-vote."/>

			<outline text="***Mac and Netscape"/>
			<outline text="I fully get how crucial to the future of the Macintosh Netscape was and probably still is. If they hadn't shipped a Mac version of Netscape, we'd all be using Windows now, me included. "/>
			<outline text="Miss the web? No way! On the other hand I'd prefer to go sailing for a year before converting all my software to Windows. Some things just aren't worth doing. Life is short. Do I want to start over? Hmmm. Making pottery sounds like more fun."/>
			<outline text="But thanks to Netscape, the Mac is still interesting! "/>
			<outline text="Here's why..."/>
			<outline text="Integration of the operating system and web browsers is now on the front line.  Pay close attention to the integration of the Microsoft browser with the local operating system. You can browse the file system using the web browser. Nice web-like graphics. An outliner that expands and collapses. It's a very well done, and it's a very important approach."/>
			<outline text="Netscape is going to have to do this, but Microsoft won't clear a path for them. Apple isn't effective as-is. Microsoft isn't likely to offer the Mac platform more than parity with Windows. A close relationship between the browser and the Mac OS is essential. "/>
			<outline text="Someone has to assure the Mac community that the new integration features will appear on the Mac, in a way that makes sense to Mac developers and users. If Apple won't do this, who will?"/>
			<outline text="The wakeup calls keep coming. We were lucky last time. Netscape put their bet on the Mac, and delivered. With Microsoft's presence rising in this area, we may not be so lucky next time. Mac is a minor stage for Microsoft theater. If Netscape diminishes in importance, the power of the Mac platform will probably diminish along with it."/>
			<outline text="***No, we're not done with Apple yet. "/>
			<outline text="Gil Amelio asks for 100 days of grace. "/>
			<outline text="Sorry, the world won't wait. "/>

			<outline text="Amelio has to choose between Microsoft and Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Content Rules&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/25/96; 3:26:23 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="As you know, I took a few days off from writing about my online travels. I even took a trip into the real world -- I went skiing! I found my center of gravity. My Texas-sized body hums and floats and twists and hops. I have balance and poise on the mountain, where gravity is something you can play with. Walking on ski-less feet can be real trouble, when you're accustomed to flying, mere walking is, er, well, hmmm, different. Yah."/>
			<outline text="I took a break from writing DaveNets not because I ran out of ideas, more because I had become overloaded with them. I wrote a few pieces last week, but they were all confused. In the end, I didn't want to ship any of them."/>
			<outline text="The geek in me was buzzed. I think I became distracted from what really matters. There's an ecology in the software business. If Apple leaves a vaccuum, someone probably will fill it. So as I zooom back into the net world, I find that I have some updated observations. Chair lift conversations brought out the truth again. As usual, I want to share my conclusions, and then I'll move onto something else."/>
			<outline text="***The Mac's role in the Internet market"/>
			<outline text="The Mac is a minor client platform, current numbers are steady at about twenty percent of the browser hits at www.hotwired.com. Twenty percent is nice market share, but it isn't enough to drive standards. I don't think this is going to change because Netscape drives this market, not Apple, nor does Apple have a chance at taking the lead here, because content developers aren't developing unique things for Mac users."/>
			<outline text="The Mac will lose ground as a client platform unless they match the new integration between Microsoft's browser and the Windows OS. Microsoft has taken the lead here, it's Apple's turn to follow."/>
			<outline text="The Mac is a minor server platform, even though the numbers may be impressive. Server sysops prefer to serve web pages from Unix boxes or NT machines. I try to find a competent ISP who will host my pages on a Mac, to run my CGI scripts, and the answer is always no. So unless I want to buy a huge pipe, I have to be happy serving stuff on a Unix box."/>
			<outline text="Apple could let go, and make an investment in smoothing out the FTP-connection between the Mac OS and other systems. There are lots of Unix people at Apple these days. Working with other platforms is good stuff. File sharing over FTP? Yes, we gotta have it. All our scripts would work!"/>
			<outline text="If Apple wants to be taken seriously in the server world, new system software is needed. The Mac file system is creaky old legacy code. We need a new low-tech file system that works with WebStar. Performance is everything. In the meantime, the Mac makes a great CGI platform."/>
			<outline text="Another thing Apple must do if it's serious about the server business -- start from scratch and design and deploy a server farm of Macintoshes. Make the economics work. The next big rage in the web world is going to be sites built out of hundreds of NT machines. If Apple wants to play in this world, we're going to have to have a way of adding Macs to racks ad infinitum. Maybe Compaq wants to do this? DEC? Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="***Switching gears..."/>
			<outline text="Think content. Think content. Think content. All indication from Apple is that they think Adobe has the problem licked with SiteMill and PageMill. I don't think this is true. Adobe's products are opportunistic. They recognize that people want easy HTML tools. But people also want to do frames and tables. Sure you could do a great editor for frames and tables. But people want to call CGI scripts and embed ShockWave stuff and Java stuff. It'll never end. Until Adobe catches up we'll be using BBEdit, if only to add these features to PageMill files. And after all that trouble, why bother? -- use BBEdit. Save trouble, save time. For now, BBEdit continues to rule this market."/>
			<outline text="Otherwise, people who write and draw still like to use Macs in numbers disproportionate to the total market share of Macs. I've said this many times before, no need to repeat it."/>
			<outline text="***The bigger problem"/>
			<outline text="There's danger in trying to wake Apple up. When they spot an opportunity they tend to fire up an internal development team. But they can't give away their software for less than I can. I think my tools solve problems that need solving. I've invested lots of time in understanding how this stuff works. And it's beginning to get easy, as the art of Mac net scripting gets better, and as the problems scripting can solve best become clearer."/>
			<outline text="In a perfect world, I should fear nothing. If I want to bring new power to Mac users, the platform vendor should be excited and help and stay out of the way. I think the chances are virtually nil that it will play out that way! It's a fun ride anyway."/>
			<outline text="Apple's foray into the web browser world is more indication that things haven't changed. Why invest in a new web browser? Didn't they see what happened at America OnLine? Cyberdog is the Apple's next eWorld, I'm sure of it."/>
			<outline text="The world will value simple highly leveraged improvements from Apple for the Mac platform. There are no home runs left for them to hit. Make the trains run on time and all will be right. We need a solid fast file system. Integrate a file system browser with Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer. No more rock and roll on TCP transports. Do a big Mac server farm with huge pipes right on the net backbone. Share it with Mac developers."/>
			<outline text="***Distractions"/>
			<outline text="In the media campaign surrounding the Microsoft's developer conference, Bill Gates was showing up everywhere. I must have read a dozen Gates interviews last week. A common repeated theme -- there is no specific Internet market. If he's serious, he's right. He's serious."/>
			<outline text="With Gatesian irony, he asks us to think about the RAM market or the hard disk market. The net is just another computing resource. Correct. All evidence is that they're supporting this well in their system software."/>
			<outline text="Another observation from the interviews -- Microsoft isn't trying to get in front of Netscape, they are trying to *be* Netscape. An incredible example of humility. To win everything, Gates has to acknowledge that the market leader is a startup that he ignored for too long. He said that Netscape has 110 percent market share. If I were Jim Clark, I'd bronze that quote and put it over the fireplace. It's worth $500 million. Maybe more! It's better than an Oscar."/>
			<outline text="Gates advises his customers to switch over to TCP as their networking protocol. Good advice, and a good competitive move. TCP is what Novell should have been. Why use a different addressing scheme for LANs? Getting rid of this bump will be good for flow."/>
			<outline text="In 1994 I said that Bill Gates was betting his company on MSN. He said it wasn't true. Now, I think even he would say I was right."/>
			<outline text="***What really matters"/>
			<outline text="But the battles between Microsoft and Netscape are distractions."/>
			<outline text="Even the censorship debate is a distraction."/>
			<outline text="The thing that really matters is moving lots of people onto the web."/>
			<outline text="I actually like looking at people's pages with pictures of their boyfriends and wives and kids and cats and bosses and boats and motorcycles and houses. I'm really tired of corporate presences on the web. They're all so silly! Someday everyone you know will have a website. It'll change the way people stay in touch with each other. And hopefully we'll make new friends this way too."/>
			<outline text="It's great that AT&amp;T and MCI are competing to get Internet access into more homes. The next step: make a website an automatic free feature of a phone account. If your number is 510-555-0552 then your web address would be http://www.phoneco.com/5105550552/. Use FTP to move stuff in. Your password is your voicemail password. It's an easy feature to add."/>
			<outline text="Here's another idea -- take a roll of film in for developing, and have scanned images stored in GIF files on the net. Nothing to upload, you don't need to buy a digital camera. Point to the pictures from your web page. Won't this be loony! Everybody's going to be doing this. Sooon, I hope."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: In &quot;Gotta Be Aretha!&quot; on 1/8/96 I dreamt I was the new CEO of Apple. There were some good ideas in that piece!"/>
			<outline text="PPS: A term I dislike -- Third Party Developer. Too arrogant. Who's first? Who's second? Another term -- Independent Software Vendor. Independent of who? Instead, call us developers. It's humble and respectful."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: There was a largely unreported system software disaster in the Macintosh world this year -- Open Transport -- which was the only way onto the net for high end Macs, and it didn't work. They shipped it anyway. Amazing. Sounds like something Ashton-Tate did in the late 80s."/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: Heard in a PBS debate on net censorship, Esther Dyson asked &quot;If you don't trust your kids when they're 14, what about when they're 18?&quot; Yay! Esther says she was a kid once. Gotta love it. She stopped the censors cold with that line. It's kid logic. Simple and truthful and potent. Right on Esther."/>
			<outline text="PPPPPS: An interesting quote attributed to Marc Andreessen: &quot;We're going to build voice telephony into our Navigator software. We can get it out to 25 or 30 million desktops in the next six months. That's a big enough critical mass for it to take off.&quot; Rock &amp; Roll! But what about bandwidth? Can the net support 5 million simultaneous phone calls?"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;I Yearn for System 6&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/2/96; 3:08:06 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Happy April 2. In case you didn't pick up on it, yesterday was April Fools Day. Coool. Last year I told big lies on April 1. This year too! Ain't nothing like the real thing baby."/>
			<outline text="***Back to the music"/>
			<outline text="Marvin Gaye! He's a fella with a one track mind. He's too busy thinking about his baby. He ain't got time for nothing else. Ain't that peculiar?"/>
			<outline text="Oh yeah, Marvin can belt them out. Motown's sweetheart, the guy that always got the girl. Diana, Kim and Tammi. He just wants to get it on. It takes two baby. Come on darling, stop beating around the bush! "/>
			<outline text="Mercy mercy me. Boy did he worry! Wow. Ain't that peculiar? YES! Motown meets the hippies. What's going on? What's going on? It's grrrreat walking music."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, just an hour ago I was nerding out to the new tune of the times in the Macintosh world. Yes, Apple is in total disarray. Yes, the platform is tottering on the edge. If everything doesn't go exactly right, I'm fairly sure there will be no such thing as a Macintosh a year from now."/>
			<outline text="This is a liberating feeling! One foot in front of the other and we move on."/>
			<outline text="***The net has mo"/>
			<outline text="Here's the deal. The web flattened out the differences between platforms. This has been going on since late 1994. Windows and Mac sing the same net song. Both platforms grew thru the Internet and both companies were undermined by the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft mobilized all its resources, reacted as only Microsoft can. Their lightbulbs turn on, they turn a corner. Action! Booooom. Yeah there they are. Everywhere."/>
			<outline text="We're still waiting to see if the response will work, if they turned the *right* corner. But they woke up and changed. Credit where credit is due. "/>
			<outline text="Apple did not wake up. Now, the train has left the station, all the wakeup calls were missed; but even now, they still think they're in the game. Amazing."/>
			<outline text="***Independence"/>
			<outline text="Apple Computer has none of the source code needed to make the Macintosh a competitive Internet platform. "/>
			<outline text="The developers are waking up to this. It's getting very independent in ISV land. Big meetings are happening. They should have happened six years ago, when Apple failed to lead a credible response to Windows 3.0, back when the Mac was a much superior platform to Windows. "/>
			<outline text="Never mind, it didn't happen that way. There's no time like now. It's finally dawning on the Mac development community, what's left of it, that they'll have to work together, to support each other, to dig out of this mess. "/>
			<outline text="***I yearn for System 6"/>
			<outline text="In the past I recommended that Apple eject CyberDog and OpenDoc. I still recommend this. Even if OpenDoc were the most compelling well-implemented timely technology in the world, I still promise you, I will not implement it. And I have a lot of company on this one."/>
			<outline text="Here's the deal. They're shipping awful operating systems at Apple. Everything is breaking. MacWEEK says, whatever you do, don't install System 7.5.3. But if you have a 9500, what do you do? You have to use Open Transport. MacTCP doesn't work. My system crashes a lot more than it used to. Should I install 7.5.3? What if my machine won't boot? Will Gil Amelio come over to my shop and fix it for me? "/>
			<outline text="Look at the choice they've given me. I need help, I don't need OpenDoc. Bugs. Ohhh. It's a morass out there. I'm knee-deep in bugs. And not liking it! "/>
			<outline text="I yearn for System 6, not System 8. It's true that my 9500 boots a lot faster, the CPU is a screamer, but it hurts every time I hear that deep long boot chord, which is sounding more and more like a death dirge to me every day. I'm sure the designers thought I'd be impressed. I would be, if I didn't have to hear this awful sound so often! Crashing computers are not funny or loveable. Maybe the other guys are worse, but Macs used to be better. Much better!"/>
			<outline text="Basic engineering failures at Apple. The kinds of mistakes that the PC software business stopped making in the early 80s. Every time they ship a new operating system I lose some of the functionality I've come to depend on. "/>
			<outline text="For example, when I switched to System 7.5 I lost SuperBoomerang. It remembered the last 20 folders in a popup menu, making it easy to bop around the file system. I could be better organized and I was. It was a little thing, but what a gem! Now I don't have it, so my day goes slower, I forget things while I have to navigate long distances in the file system, and I don't embark on projects that would further complicate my disk structure. It was a very important piece of software."/>
			<outline text="I used to use Deneba Artworks to edit graphics. It worked the way I wanted to work. I had learned many of its nuances. When I moved to a PowerPC it stopped working. I don't have time to figure out PhotoShop, so I can't edit pictures anymore."/>
			<outline text="In the latest system upgrade, Netscape isn't running very well. Eudora is trashing messages and losing indexes. I know the operating system is responsible for these problems, the same binaries used to run with far fewer problems on my old system."/>
			<outline text="Writing this DaveNet piece caused several system crashes. Every time the machine reboots I wonder how much of my work I lost. They will tell me to get a new release, but get a new release of what? Everything? Oh man. I'll be here for years. "/>
			<outline text="When will it ever settle down? With every release of the OS we lose more functionality. At the same time, app developers are moving very quickly in some areas. We're losing important things as we go along, and the important point is, we wouldn't be losing them if Apple was doing its job."/>
			<outline text="***Here's reality"/>
			<outline text="In this midst of these calamaties, Apple has the gall to propose not only a total overhaul of the operating system, Copland, but they want to lead us into a whole new paradigm, OpenDoc."/>
			<outline text="Mac users -- get a life. Instead of dreaming of Copland and new application architectures, wouldn't it be better to fix the bugs and performance bottlenecks in the current system? We're just beginning to reach maturity in System 7 features in the app base. It's frustrating for Apple to call attention elsewhere, when developers are finally catching up."/>
			<outline text="I don't care if InfoWorld likes OpenDoc. It's a dream. At best it's the Newton five years ago. But it might be Taligent or Kaleida or PowerTalk or Publish &amp; Subscribe or Windows 1.0 or VisiOn or FrameWork, dBASE IV or ProDOS or Lisa or Apple /// or CPM-86. Even QuickTime, one of Apple's successes, took years to happen after it shipped. Whatever, it's way off in the future. Don't journalists read their own magazines? On page 1 they say Apple has no future. On page 32 they give OpenDoc an award for *being* the future. I can't overlook this contradiction."/>
			<outline text="Delivered goods is what counts. Judge a computer by what shows up on desktops, not in white papers and corporate videos. "/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates says his chief competitor is Windows 3.1, not Macintosh. I believe him. Copland has to displace an operating system that would totally fade into the background if Apple would just fix the bugs. I wish they would do it quickly, and then send the engineers on vacation. Then, and only then, should they consider the possibility of throwing all the cards into the air again by doing a major OS upgrade."/>
			<outline text="Net-net, no to OpenDoc, and no to Copland too."/>
			<outline text="***Do you give up on the Mac?"/>
			<outline text="Not yet."/>
			<outline text="I swear, I'll turn out the lights when I'm finished doing Mac software."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, I'm having fun."/>
			<outline text="Please don't blame me."/>
			<outline text="My parents raised me this way."/>
			<outline text="***Is Microsoft serious about the Mac?"/>
			<outline text="There's been a leadership vaccuum in the Mac world for many years. Microsoft was part of the problem, throwing all their specs and software at Windows, and delegating the Mac to ports of their Windows products. They have had their own share of Macintosh calamaties, most notably the fat buggy incomplete Word 6.0 shipped in late 1994."/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates is not loved in this world. Apple people say that Bill is dishonest. They're confused. Gates always tells the truth. You just have to understand the language of the software world. Apple has never had a leader that spoke the language, and they still don't. The fanatics in the Mac community buy into Apple's paranoia. I've never believed that Gates is dishonest. Other people do though."/>
			<outline text="When I get together with Microsoft's top Mac guy, Don Bradford, donbrad@microsoft.com, I find we speak the same langauge. The people on his team, the ones doing Microsoft Internet Explorer for the Mac, are taking a new approach. They're doing new Mac software, not ports of Windows apps. And they're thinking bigger than browsers; they want to do a whole line of Mac products, to build it up as a great client and content platform."/>
			<outline text="Most important, they are reaching out into the community. They're meeting with all the key software producers, talking about the resources Microsoft has assigned to the Macintosh. It's energizing. A Mac where the decisions don't have to flow thru the bottlenecks, cul de sacs and infinite loops at Apple. What an idea!"/>
			<outline text="You have to wonder why, after all this time, just when it appears that Apple is totally out of gas, why is Microsoft willing to fund a 60-person development team doing software that only runs on Macintosh? Further, you have to wonder why they're willing to take the lead, to fill the gaps that Apple is leaving?"/>
			<outline text="Some people theorize it was a condition of the deal with America OnLine. AOL has one million Macintosh members. It makes sense that Microsoft would have to agree to do an excellent Mac web browser in order for AOL to turn over all their client development to Microsoft. But Bradford was funded before the rushed AOL deal, so perhaps we have to look elsewhere for the motivation? "/>
			<outline text="In the end, only Bradford and his chain of command can answer the question.  The only question I have to answer is if I'm willing to work with them. I didn't have to think about this very long. The answer is yes."/>
			<outline text="***Two followups"/>
			<outline text="In the last DaveNet piece, &quot;Content Rules&quot;, I asked about developing film and receiving your output on the web in the form of GIF files. I got a hundred emails pointing me to http://www.filmworks.com/. And I got an email from a product manager at Kodak, explaining that they plan to enter this market in a big way in the near future. So it's happening. Dust off the old 35 millimeter, you won't need a digital camera to easily get your personal pictures accessible to millions of people on the worldwide web."/>
			<outline text="In the same piece I quoted Marc Andreessen, marca@netscape.com, talking about Netscape's next push -- turning the Internet into a phone network. I asked the obvious question -- what about bandwidth? Here was Andreessen's reply:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;The bandwidth issue is always a red herring. Bandwidth expands over time to meet demand. It's purely a matter of economics. That's why the telecom bill was such a good thing, sans the decency act -- it encourages rational economic behavior."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Remember, the 'backbone' (now multiple backbones) have gone from 56 kilobits per second a small number of years ago to 155 megabits now, and over the next few years get up to 10 gigabits and above."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Bandwidth is not a problem. The capital investment being poured into this industry and the amount of attention being focused on it by major-league telecom companies (all of them), along with the fundamental attractiveness of the business model (e.g. for telcos, Internet access makes a lot of sense as a fundamental service offering), guarantees spiraling amounts of bandwidth to meet demand. Sure, there will be hiccups here and there, but nothing systemic or long-term damaging."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Bigger issues are, in no particular order: standards for Internet telephony (we believe in RTP et al), directory services, crypto policy again (you want your Internet phone calls to be secure, after all -- that would be a huge value-add), gateways into POTS (start a phone call on the net but call someone using a normal phone), user interface issues (gotta be really easy), etc.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="Inside the company, they know they screwed up. No one argues with that. They've paid the price, they've released new software that fixes the problems. But an influential weekly magazine has reported problems with the fix. There's a lot of confusion in the user community. "/>

			<outline text="They know this for a fact: if the developer installs the new release, the problems will go away."/>
			<outline text="How to turn this into a win? How to get the developer to install the new software, and get some good ink in the process, and help the community move on?"/>
			<outline text="Here's how you do it..."/>

			<outline text="From Jim Gable, gable@applelink.apple.com, a product manager at Apple Computer:"/>
			<outline text="Dave,"/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="Yeah, we have missed a lot of balls recently at Apple and a ton of them were software lobs. But I recommend you install 7.5.3 before getting more worried about it. This release is our `making amends' release and the feedback so far is quite good. (For example, compare the MacUser comments to the MacWeek ones!)"/>
			<outline text="In fact, it's fair to say that the vast majority of 7.5.3 complaints are related to downloading it from the nets (it's big) and installing it (be sure to follow the read me file!) Once installed, people are really happy. Especially 7.5.2 users which I assume you are with your 9500."/>
			<outline text="After you try it -- let me know what you think. Yikes!"/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="Jim Gable"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="This is a perfect response."/>
			<outline text="First, admit the screwup. Then put your personal reputation on the line. Offer justification, admit another screwup (everyone knows that it's been hard to get the new software, me too) to establish credibility. By the way, I pick up an implicit thanks for not reporting the downloading problem, it's appreciated. Then offer help if there are any problems with the installation, add a little humor, and sign it personally."/>
			<outline text="Done. Done well, in fact. "/>
			<outline text="Most important overall point -- it's respectful."/>
			<outline text="The customer is always right, and so is the developer. "/>
			<outline text="A really nice case study in platform management."/>
			<outline text="So I took Gable's advice, I installed the software. It's working. I'm hopeful! Fingers crossed."/>
			<outline text="I also got a pointer to a product called Default Folder, &lt;http://www.stclairsw.com/&gt;, which does what SuperBoomerang used to do, and works with the new system software. I downloaded it, installed it, and so far so good."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/5/96; 3:28:27 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here's a radical idea!"/>
			<outline text="Bet that caught your attention..."/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="OK."/>
			<outline text="Remember back in the 1980s when standardized user interfaces were the big thing in the software business? "/>
			<outline text="Here's the pitch."/>
			<outline text="Come use our computer. On this machine all the apps work the same. Learn one app and you've learned them all. "/>
			<outline text="Scrollbars and icons. A mouse. Windows. Icons. Pulldown menus. Desk accessories. The trashcan. These concepts are here to stay. You can safely put them in the history books. "/>
			<outline text="Having a mouse and graphics really changed things. It paid to rethink apps and try to take the art of user interface to the next level. So that's what happened. And computers got easier. And they also got much more powerful. "/>
			<outline text="A win. "/>
			<outline text="And a win."/>
			<outline text="Now we have the web. A new surface to play with. It adds three new elements, pictures, links and a worldwide network."/>
			<outline text="If it was such a good idea to rethink user interfaces when graphics and mice came along, maybe it's a good idea to rethink UIs now that browsers and webs exist? Of course it is! "/>
			<outline text="Actually it's always a good idea to rethink user interfaces. But you don't always have the opportunity to do it. Things are more fluid now. Opportunities exist."/>
			<outline text="So where are we at? The web is a chaotic hodgepodge. There are no standard graphics. Everyone is all over the map on UI. You have to learn how to use a website. They don't all work the same way. "/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, I like rock and roll. Without a chance for chaos, you don't get a chance to explore the issues. If you lock things down too quickly you lose the opportunity to take big leaps. But we've innovated enough to see some common threads."/>
			<outline text="OK."/>
			<outline text="Websites have structural links. There usually is a hierarchy imposed. A way to pop out a level, or to go deeper. There's a sequential ordering to most big websites, a Next and a Prev. Go thru the chain and you'll see everything."/>
			<outline text="There's the concept of a Home, the very topmost page. High flow home pages are very valuble. Check it out. Lycos just went public for $300 million based on the flow of its home, http://www.lycos.com/. Coool!"/>
			<outline text="Search engines make a big difference. If you don't use Alta Vista, check it out. A new WebCrawler is coming. Distributed search engine software is starting to appear. "/>
			<outline text="The art of searching makes the art of structuring possible. Can't find it by navigating? Try searching. They support each other beautifully."/>
			<outline text="Categorizing, sorting and allowing for randomness; that's the software technology of the web, circa spring 1996."/>
			<outline text="And pictures."/>
			<outline text="In the world of graphics we had folders and stop signs and pictures of disks and pages. New elements have been added -- Under Contruction. New! Works with Netscape. Blue ribbons. "/>
			<outline text="Familiar logos, no need to read the text, I already know what they're saying. "/>
			<outline text="In this world pictures are content too. Check out &lt;http://www.cnn.com/&gt; for examples. CNN is a software developer. Ain't that peculiar? Yes!"/>
			<outline text="We still need the icons of the desktop world, because the world of the web and my local world meet in the web browser. Look at what Microsoft is doing with Internet Explorer on Windows for a clue."/>
			<outline text="So -- the conclusion -- we still have more knowhow to transfer from the world of the desktop to the world of the web. "/>
			<outline text="And we get a chance to invent more knowhow."/>
			<outline text="Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="Dig we must. "/>
			<outline text="Coool."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: We're not quite done with desktop UIs either. More tweaks are possible. How about adding an option to Save As that automatically puts a serial number, MyDoc.1, MyDoc.2, at the end of a filename; so I can quickly save off new versions of a document without overwriting previous versions?"/>

That cry of love is so alarming! Love -- what a powerful thing. She's a three time loser. Bonnie has music for all the moods. "/>

			<outline text="Yeah."/>
			<outline text="***It's not funny"/>
			<outline text="Last week, when my Macintosh sea legs were still shaky from a system software catastrophe, I got an email from a top Apple exec, Dave Nagel, that asked why Apple should work with me when I'm so critical of Apple in DaveNet. Good question! "/>
			<outline text="Apple should work with me because with my software you can tie together the leading Macintosh Internet applications into a customizable suite of client, content development and server solutions. We could lead the market together, Dave, instead of waiting for all these apps to work with OpenDoc. We can deliver the benefits of customizable integration right now."/>
			<outline text="A bunch of years ago I complained to one of your predecessors, Jean-Louis Gassee, that Apple was investing too much in HyperCard, that it wasn't the right longterm answer for Apple or developers or users. I was in the middle of developing Frontier, which embraced the Macintosh operating system, instead of trying to replace it, as HyperCard did. I felt it was a strategic mistake to split the operating system into two parts -- the desktop interface on one side, and HyperCardLand on the other side. They were so damned different!"/>
			<outline text="Gassee asked me the kind of question that a business person, concerned about meeting payroll and making numbers, would ask. Would I mind if they sold HyperCard until I got my software ready? I couldn't argue with this! It made me feel respected, and I understood that I was doing what I had decried -- I was FUDing a product that had delivered, with my promises of a much better land -- someday. HyperCard may have been ill-conceived. But it was shipping and people were liking it."/>
			<outline text="Gassee was right to say no to me, then, as it would be right for Apple to say no to OpenDoc now. It's hogging all your attention. You have put all your hopes on it. But, at best, it's years away from delivery. "/>
			<outline text="I can hear you objecting right now! No, you're saying, OpenDoc will be ready for end users in August. But how long before OpenDoc is something users will want? It isn't about menus and windows and code. A lot of things have to happen before it's a platform. And it's very, very far from a sure thing. Most proposed platforms don't make it. It's just a fact. It's not my fault. It's not yours."/>
			<outline text="Gassee had a sense of keeping the users entertained. He got it. Keep them coming back for new goodies. And maybe a breakthru. For that you need lots of risk-taking developers. That's how you get winners, not by hiring researchers to invent miracles for you. I'm sure he did his share of hiring, he's a good guy, but not perfect, but there was an important lesson. Don't be picky about where your software comes from. Promote what you got."/>
			<outline text="And it really is an either-or thing, developers can't compete with the platform vendor, no matter how well-intentioned the PV is. You have to leave well marked voids in the market, places where you won't play, to create markets. Apple did the opposite, invading competitive markets with void-creating white papers. "/>
			<outline text="OK."/>
			<outline text="***Let's get constructive"/>
			<outline text="Here's a new direction. Assume there are 20 million Macintosh users. Assume that one tenth of them are already on the net. Let's offer them something better. Assume that half of them want to get on the net. Let's make it easy for them. If we can give them software that makes a Mac user ten times more effective on the net than their Windows and Unix counterparts, why shouldn't we? "/>
			<outline text="Apple has always promoted the Mac as easy to use. My claim: that may have worked in the past, but we lose now if you sell Macintosh as the easy to use platform, because that negates the power of the platform. The power comes from its depth and maturity. And the profits come from longtime users who want to do new things. "/>
			<outline text="You have to catch users when they're busy inventing. Right now they're working on getting on the web as readers and writers and servers. Things that help them do that will make sense to them. Other things will seem like diversions."/>
			<outline text="Fact: all the Internet apps support the System 7 scripting standards. That technology must be commercialized before it can be used by lots of users. Commercialization. An important concept. It doesn't end with delivery. We never completed the task of commercializing System 7. Let's finish the job, and then turn it over to the developers and users."/>
			<outline text="As I've said previously, there's a new independence in the Mac development community, and that's unlocking a lot of power, and that's a really good thing. No, we won't need Apple to make it happen. But it could work better with Apple's support and acknowledgement and resources."/>
			<outline text="I have already disclosed the first step in the plan to Apple, and outlined where I want to go from there. I want to hear back from them, but we're not waiting. An important distinction."/>
			<outline text="By the way, the only reason I criticize Apple is because I care about the platform, and I care about the script writing community, and I care about my software, and I care about me! The day that I stop criticizing Apple, you can assume it's because I've become a Windows developer or a Be developer, or have chosen to go sailing around the world, or to make pottery. I am not a quiet person. If I'm in a room, it's likely that you'll know I'm there."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;thePerfectParent&quot;&gt;The perfect parent&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="I have a friend, a man, who's going thru a hugely painful process. A long marriage. Divorce. Lots of stuff comes up. Old wounds open. Pain and confusion. I've been there myself. It all comes back. Oh man!"/>
			<outline text="At times like this it can be really hard to be positive. But when the wounds are open, they have a chance to heal; if you really go into it, and fully experience what's happening. After a long dysfunctional relationship ends, there's huge pain, but you get a chance to redesign your life. "/>
			<outline text="It's like a wakeup call in the middle of the night. You're groggy and upset. I just want to go back to sleep! But the pain is so great that you can't sleep. It's time to wake up. Like it or not. "/>
			<outline text="When a big tree falls it creates space for new life. But you really miss the old tree, the old way of life, and all the support that it gave you. "/>
			<outline text="Sometimes I think we're all searching the planet for the perfect parent, the replacement for the ones that let us down. That's probably the biggest pain we feel when a relationship ends. Where's my mom! Who's going to take care of me now?"/>
			<outline text="The answer -- inside each of us is the perfect parent, the one we never had. You can give that to yourself, just like you give it to your kids. I can take my boy on trips. Show him neat things. And make promises to him, develop his trust. At times he doesn't trust the adult Dave. Acknowledge that. It's OK. Promise to try to do better. Really mean it. When I can do this I really feel free and happy. I'm not kidding, that's really what it takes."/>
			<outline text="Little boys are very forgiving people. All they really need to know is that you care about them, and are doing your best. You don't have to *always* protect them, they don't want that, and will struggle against it. It's cool because that's how I express my creativity. But the little boy inside me needs to know that when he goes on an adventure, he can always come home for acceptance and good home cooking. I never want to be very far away from home."/>
			<outline text="So, I am both a little boy and a big man. I am a source of caring and protecting and giving. I can be responsible, which means I will respond if a situation calls for a response. But I also like to have fun!"/>
			<outline text="There are actually lots of voices inside each of us, but we're discouraged from seeing this by the way we were brought up. I have a voice inside me that's my father. I need to challenge this voice. Something bad happens. He yells at me. I say firmly, respectfully, sometimes even aloud, &quot;No, Dave is not an idiot. He's a very smart person, and I love him very much, and I'd like you to stop saying that.&quot; After practicing this dialog for a couple of years my father's voice has become more loving. It turns out that the parent inside me can learn and let go of his pain instead of giving it to the little boy."/>
			<outline text="A disrespectful voice coming from inside. We are not single consistent entities. Each of us is actually a community! But we get to create the rules for this community. I find that the most important rule is that we treat each other with respect. It's OK to disagree, but be respectful about it."/>
			<outline text="This sense of a person as a community is part of a new exploration in psychology called voice dialog. Often people who practice voice dialog call themselves hypnotherapists; a lot of people think that's about going to sleep when in fact it's about waking up. Many of us have been in a trance ever since something happened, as a kid, that was too much to handle. You gave up on something, realized your parents were selfish beings, not good protectors. You couldn't trust them and you needed to trust them because you were just a little boy or girl."/>
			<outline text="Now we are adults, and are responsible for caring for ourselves. We have to look inside to find the good parent, not outside. Once this happens, you can't be lonely anymore. You have great company, all those voices can be your friends! "/>
			<outline text="You can empower them selectively, as appropriate, according to circumstance. If it's safe, go for it, be a kid, have fun! If it's dangerous, let the kid rest, the adult responds. Often we look to other adults to provide safety, and later are disappointed and hurt when they let us down."/>
			<outline text="All this came up for me by sharing the experience of a divorce with a friend. I found I wanted to send him a message -- you are not alone in the world. I am your friend. Look into my eyes. I'm here."/>
			<outline text="I think that's another common theme. We're all searching the planet for proof that there are other beings. If you just open your eyes, have the courage to make eye contact, you'll see them. "/>
			<outline text="Everywhere!"/>

			<outline text="My comments... Contratulations to Dave Nagel. I think this is an excellent choice for both him and for AT&amp;T. I've been a critic of his role at Apple, and have engaged in various heated email exchanges with Nagel over the years.

			<outline text="***Flaming Lists"/>
			<outline text="I got an invite to present my ideas on a random mailing list. I don't want to say which one for reasons which will become clear. "/>
			<outline text="I know it's a hotbed of flamers. I'm sure they have motives. Let's get Dave to come visit. We'll give him a piece of our minds. "/>
			<outline text="Such sad people. They could open their eyes and discover there's a big world out there. Instead they recline in the comfort of their right-ness. Anyone who enters our sphere is roasting material. "/>
			<outline text="I have experience with this mailing list, having been singed once, but I recovered. Being flamed is not pleasant, so I declined to participate."/>
			<outline text="When I see other people get flamed, I get sympathetic. My first impulse is to defend them. Sometimes I give in to that impulse."/>
			<outline text="***Is Brad bad?"/>
			<outline text="Here's a case. Brad Schrick, http://www.brad.net/, is not happy! "/>
			<outline text="He runs a big website that glorifies the Macintosh as a web server. He does it as a labor of love. No money for Brad. "/>
			<outline text="Brad posts a long sad missive about Apple abandoning the Mac OS in favor of Unix. As I read it, I recognize his discomfort. I've heard Apple people make these noises. It bothered me too. I run a Mac web server. I like it. It works. Having Apple say that Unix is the web server platform of their future makes me think I'm making a mistake by continuing to invest here. In other words, I see the truth in Brad's point of view."/>
			<outline text="I didn't read all the responses to Brad's message, but I read enough to recognize the pattern. A flamefest. Out of control. They do things I hate. They tell Brad what he really means. They expose his conflicts of interest. They paint him as a fool. They tell him Apple is going to be angry with him. They say he's wrong. "/>
			<outline text="Could all this possibly be true? Could anyone really be as bad as Brad would appear to be from the email he generated? No way. I know that Brad is a good guy. I think most of the flamers, in calmer moods, understand that too. So why do they attack so personally? "/>
			<outline text="***They have something to say!"/>
			<outline text="Psychologists are going to study Internet mailing lists someday; here's what they will find out..."/>
			<outline text="When they work, they're like offices and meetings. Collaborative places where people help and support and listen to each other. People contribute to each others' success. Give and get. "/>
			<outline text="When they don't work they're like unhappy families. Thru the virtual interface it's very easy to project. A psychological term, it means &quot;to cause a light and shadows to appear on a surface,&quot; like a movie projector that casts images on an inert screen. "/>
			<outline text="I've seen that before! your inner child screams. That's bad! "/>
			<outline text="Time to release, to let go of some old stuff. And out it comes. People are hurting. It comes back together, eventually, but no one forgets how they didn't get heard, how right they were and how wrong everyone (or someone) else was."/>
			<outline text="***Right and wrong"/>
			<outline text="I'm right, therefore you're wrong. This is the argument we had in the family I grew up in. I think this is the big argument of humanity. The problem we have with everyone else. They're so wrong, and I'm so right. If only they would listen to me, do what I want them to do, they'd see how right I am!"/>
			<outline text="***An experiment"/>
			<outline text="Instead of participating, someday, make an effort to observe an email flamefest and stay uninvolved. Imagine people actually saying those things to other people, face to face. "/>
			<outline text="Clue: this is the stuff that people are thinking but don't dare say. "/>
			<outline text="Internet mailing lists are like sewers, carrying the refuse that we can't share with other people who could hit us, or fire us, or abandon us. But on the net, we can broadcast our pain to the world, using a virtual person, a total projection, as a symbol for our discontent. Here's someone who's wrong. Everyone look! Agree with me or suffer the consequences."/>
			<outline text="Another experiment: in your day to day real life, not the virtual one, try to make eye contact with people you meet. Then tell them they're wrong. Can you look people in the eye and say they're wrong? Probably not. Maybe there's a clue here. "/>
			<outline text="As soon as you make someone wrong, communication stops. The discussion gets down to their quality as a human being. It's a silly argument. Not likely to reach a resolution. Can you imagine someone admitting, after a long heated discussion, you're right, I'm a hypocrite. I have other motives I'm not revealing. I'm wrong. You're right!"/>
			<outline text="There are so many ways to say someone is wrong. But every one of them is a waste of time because everyone, at their core, is right. I really believe that. I think I can almost prove it. People can get confused and do and say things that invoke our sense of wrongness, that remind us of our values, and of times when we couldn't be heard when we had something important to say. "/>
			<outline text="It doesn't make them bad, or wrong. And if you insist that they agree to being wrong, you will never be satisfied."/>
			<outline text="***You're right!"/>
			<outline text="On 5/4/95, in &quot;The Cute Little Nut&quot;, I suggested that everyone forgive each other.  &quot;Hi, I forgive you,&quot; says Jeff. &quot;Thank you. And I forgive you,&quot; says Judy. &quot;Thank you,&quot; says Jeff.  "/>
			<outline text="The conversation continues. "/>
			<outline text="Jeff says: &quot;I've been thinking about our last argument. Now I understand what you've been saying. I'm so glad you argued with me. I can see why it was important to you. Thank you for helping me understand this.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="When you're in the middle of an mailing list flamewar, try saying that, or some variant of it. Say it first to one side. You make good points! I'm learning a lot. Then say it to the other side. You're doing great! Your arguments make a lot of sense. Give each participant the right-ness they're asking for. And watch what happens. "/>
			<outline text="I suggest doing this off-list, otherwise it's likely to divert the flamers to you. It could ruin the experiment. And possibly be unpleasant too."/>
			<outline text="***Words are the window inside"/>
			<outline text="Percentile-wise, I'm probably near the top of the pyramid in terms of being able to make things happen with words. But does that mean that my ideas are any more valuble than the ideas of people who can't express themselves as powerfully? "/>
			<outline text="We'll never know! The person who figures out the meaning of life may be a deaf-mute. That sure would be ironic!"/>
			<outline text="Words are the window inside. They give you a look below the surface. "/>
			<outline text="The only way to find out what's going on inside another person is to listen to them. Their words may be confused, but you can be sure of one thing, they're trying to say something. Everyone is, young or old, educated or not, woman or man, rich or poor. Everyone has something to say. And some reason for believing they're right."/>
			<outline text="The key is to ignore it when they say you're wrong. I know it's hard to do! But when they say you're wrong, they're just telling you why they've decided not to listen to you. That's all they're doing. Nothing more."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Can you forgive them for that? "/>
			<outline text="PS: A flame reduction suggestion. Offer each side a place to state their point of view on the web. Let them add to it when ever they want. The web may be better suited for debating than mailing lists are."/>

The CD is &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and lots of very grand old Opry folk. Banjos, mandolins, dobros, fiddles and auto harps. They aren't exactly humming and wailing. It's more like kvetching and complaining! But they do it so nice, with such a down home twang, it's easy to overlook all the whining that's going on."/>

			<outline text="When you hear Apple's Internet strategy next month, it seems likely that they'll leave out a bunch of key players, and give credit to a bunch of people that don't count. It's OK, if everyone remembers that. Do you use any Oracle software? I don't and I don't expect to."/>
			<outline text="Apple is a corporation and tends to see the outside world in terms of other corporations. They understand corporations that develop software, but they have little understanding of, or respect for, individuals that develop software. Same with users. "/>
			<outline text="It's a problem because the Mac has always been the individual's platform. We're at odds with the platform vendor. They would understand my software if I got a job. But people like me never get jobs! Oooops. There's the problem."/>

			<outline text="Cooool, Apple could have said. Sounds right! Keep on the sunny side. As long as you're buying a new graphic computer, why not buy the best?"/>
			<outline text="At that time Windows was a pale imitator. A graphic shell on DOS. A bit of a lie. A comparison chart would have favored Apple heavily. But Apple didn't do any comparison charts. "/>
			<outline text="I said to Sculley in countless emails: &quot;System 7 is shipping. Bang the drums!&quot; Instead he says: Look over here! Object oriented operating systems! System 7 is old stuff. Think Pink!"/>
			<outline text="Oy! None of our software works over there. It's a paradigm shift. A discontinuity. Years and years away."/>
			<outline text="Magic was getting ready to happen in System 7. You can see that in hindsight. It's finally become a mature operating system in 1996, widely supported by the major apps. Here's a short list of apps that support the integration APIs in System 7: Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Eudora, BBEdit, WebStar, Fetch, Anarchie, StuffIt, FileMaker, and the Finder."/>
			<outline text="The Mac OS delivered on its promise. It needed Apple's support in 1990. It didn't get it."/>
			<outline text="***My point"/>
			<outline text="I don't trust Apple to get it. I'm concerned because the analysts and journalists appear to be looking to Apple to define the role that the Mac platform will play in the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="The reality is that the Mac already has a big role in the Internet. Web content tools are the best on the Mac, I believe by an order of magnitude. The Mac OS delivered on its promise, and now so have the apps. This is a story MacWEEK could be working on. Nothing Apple says is going to change it. Apple may announce some interesting products, but for the most part, they're probably going to miss what's really going on."/>
			<outline text="So I'll fill in for them."/>
			<outline text="Journalists covering this story should look at System 7, not Copland. "/>
			<outline text="Look at System 7 scripting, AppleScript and Frontier, not OpenDoc. "/>
			<outline text="Look at the integration between Internet apps. It's mature delivered technology, in wide use. "/>
			<outline text="Any accurate comparison of the platforms should take all this into account."/>
			<outline text="***What a year!"/>
			<outline text="I spent the entire month of April deep in software development. If things go as I think they will, I'll spend May doing more development. "/>
			<outline text="The battles of January between Sun, Microsoft and Netscape seem like distant memories. Delivery is less than the promise. Java still is not a fixture in the web world. Does anyone have a compelling Internet app (not an Intranet app) that's implemented in Java? "/>
			<outline text="It could be that Java demands too much of the system, and may be too buggy to deliver excellent content. The lowtech, low-bandwidth features, tables and &amp;ltblockquote&gt;, are still what works and still what people use."/>
			<outline text="I like the CNN website, http://www.cnn.com/. Of all the news sources on the net, they do it the best, I think. A quick-loading low-bandwidth home page. A summary of top stories. All their archives are online so it's cool to point at them. No password, no fee. People say that the Wall Street Journal website is good too, but I find it hard to find the meat. And it requires a password. I don't like passwords! They break the flow."/>
			<outline text="The battles of February, between Washington and the net, seem like distant memories too. The smut keeps showing up, with passwords and fees that require the user to have a credit card. Kids don't have credit cards. I don't see why we need laws."/>
			<outline text="But the creative artistic sexuality on the net has disappeared. Thoughtful people weren't doing it for the money, just to share what they love and learn. They've gone away. It's totally predictable! The smut pays and the art goes. The east coast guys get their wish. If the law stays on the books, they get editorial control of this medium. Bad news for individuals."/>
			<outline text="I guess there are limits to how wildly a new technology can grow. It's OK, I can make web tools. You can't hurry love! We waited for System 7, we can wait for Congress too. Every two years we elect the House of Representatives. In four years we'll elect another president. The Internet will be the medium of politics. We'll use it effectively. Maybe not in 1996, but some day. You can be sure of this."/>
			<outline text="So, in April I was digging. May -- more digging. But when things heat up again, I'll be back. I like controversy! "/>
			<outline text="Keep the pot boiling. "/>
			<outline text="Dig we must!"/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="It's been an intense month already. Yes!"/>
			<outline text="I've been listening to James Taylor's Greatest Hits CD to keep me flowing when it seems it's impossible to be calm. It's relaxing music."/>
			<outline text="He's going to Carolina in his mind! Me too. I can see the sun shine. Yes, it's just like a friend of mine. "/>
			<outline text="Coooool."/>
			<outline text="***Macintosh Internet Strategies"/>
			<outline text="I'm writing a new DaveNet piece, about my experiences shipping a software product that is both an app and a website. But the shipping process has kept me from finishing the piece! I *will* finish it this weekend. Watch your inboxes."/>
			<outline text="In this piece, I outline my version of the Macintosh Internet strategy. The strategy will be built around the standard Macintosh net apps. Around the Finder and System 7. It does not depend on OpenDoc gaining a consensus. It doesn't depend on Copland shipping. It all works today. "/>
			<outline text="On Monday Apple will outline their version of the Macintosh Internet strategy. I will be there. I expect I'll have comments! Respectful ones, of course."/>
			<outline text="***My Contribution"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, we've been cooking a fine new meal, Frontier 4.0. Great web content tools. Ties together all the standards, including some new ones. My dream, of a powerful cross-application script development and runtime system, has been realized. I'm learning a lot. And realizing dreams makes you happy! It's cooool."/>
			<outline text="The new website is at http://www.scripting.com/frontier/."/>
			<outline text="I hope you check it out. Watch the News page for updates. If you've been missing your DaveNets, you'll find a lot of the missing stuff on that site."/>
			<outline text="***DaveNet is moving too"/>
			<outline text="In the next few weeks DaveNet will move off www.hotwired.com."/>
			<outline text="The email distribution of DaveNet will continue without interruption."/>
			<outline text="The DaveNet website will be at a different location on June 1."/>
			<outline text="Many thanks to the people of HotWired! I've really enjoyed the collaboration. I've made many new friends there, and grown thru the association. I hope to contribute to Wired and HotWired in the future. I have total respect for what we accomplished in the last year and a half. How much this world has changed in that period! So much more change coming. Whew!"/>
			<outline text="So, as of June 1, I will be totally independent. Not a columnist anymore. Just Dave. Software developer and online writer. A person, and a professional."/>
			<outline text="Still digging!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: An idea for Apple -- port QuickDraw to Windows and make it a plugin. Why didn't I think of this before? It's a killer idea."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Releasing a new product at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference? Lots of developers do. Know someone who is? Check out http://www.scripting.com/wwdc/. It's easy! Please pass this pointer around the Macintosh development community. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Frontier 4.0 is free. I want to set a new net scripting standard and make the Macintosh the most powerful web content development platform. Many thanks to all the people who made Frontier 4.0 possible. Check out the &quot;Credits&quot; page for a list."/>

			<outline text="Goood morning!"/>
			<outline text="A quick DaveNet. Lots of processing going on here. Yaya! It's really something when your cherished beliefs get exploded. I need a nap! Ohright. Cooool. It's 4AM. Time to write!"/>
			<outline text="Gil Amelio is OK. He's the first Apple CEO that you can look in the eye. Steve Jobs didn't have a clue that there was anyone else in the world. Sculley was always out of the room before he came into the room. Spindler stayed in his room. With the door shut."/>
			<outline text="Amelio seems to be right here. Where he is. He's not the center -- he leaves room for other people. He's not in another room -- he listens and speaks, and feeds back. He's an interactive CEO. I can't tell much more from a 45-minute meeting, but what I saw so far looks good."/>
			<outline text="People used to joke that there was no adult supervision at Apple. It got to be an ugly joke because it was so true. (Jokes are *always* true, especially funny ones.) There didn't seem to be a limit to how selfish Apple could be. A developer ships a product, within weeks Apple has a new strategy which circles the area the developer is working in, without including the developer. "/>
			<outline text="They shoot before they think. They only partially understand the problem. Their attention span is short. They replace the developer with expensive employees who are late and miss the mark. If they only realized how this stifled the market! the developer would think."/>
			<outline text="But there was always another developer coming along to play the fool for Apple. Product depth and quality and track records count for nothing. No momentum builds, no markets get developed. Apple's snub sticks. Users buy into Apple's vision, get confused, wait, and eventually forget why they were waiting. They stop buying new ideas. Markets die. Black holes loom where there could have been growth."/>
			<outline text="It happened in the groupware market. It happened in development tools and multimedia tools. The Finder has been frozen in time for a decade, with minor hacks added at each end of the menu bar. "/>
			<outline text="The boat rocks when Apple moves. Things break! So the market has been fear-driven, so little movement at the core. I've been over and over this, countless times, no need to repeat it, at least not at this time."/>
			<outline text="Now there appears to be an adult at Apple. I told Amelio the story of the Mac, in fifteen sentences. Expressed my wish for the future. No more lies. Let's clean it up. Get in agreement. I hope he heard me. "/>
			<outline text="I forgot to ask Amelio if Apple is for sale. We learned, when Brent Schlender did his Fortune cover story on Apple in February, that Apple had been positioning itself continuously to be acquired since 1986. "/>
			<outline text="There was always a boyfriend -- DEC, IBM, Sun and Sony and probably others. That explained the grand initiatives, the emphasis on Apple's internal R&amp;D. They were trying to pump up the company's image and value. Potential acquirers didn't see any value in R&amp;D in developer's companies. So Apple didn't respect or protect their developers. Short-term thinking, which in the end didn't get them anywhere because they didn't get acquired."/>
			<outline text="Listening to Amelio speak, it seems they may now be taking a long-term view of things. I was surprised that some people were still at Apple. Amelio said that it would all shake out. People would either meet his objectives or not. So everyone gets another chance to do it right. I think that's OK. "/>
			<outline text="It seems that now, as Apple approaches 20 years in business, it may finally be growing up."/>
			<outline text="That's good!"/>
			<outline text="***Third Party"/>
			<outline text="I've always hated the term Third Party. It's very arrogant! Who's the First Party? How come you never hear about Second Parties? I much prefer the term Developer. So much more neutral and respectful."/>
			<outline text="Regardless, I heard something on the stage at WWDC yesterday that amazed me. Larry Tesler, speaking on behalf of Apple's Internet strategy, referred to Apple as a Third Party! Yah. Wow. Pinch me. Such humility! (I'm not being sarcastic.)"/>
			<outline text="Who is Apple the third party of?"/>
			<outline text="Netscape! "/>
			<outline text="Ye-hi!"/>
			<outline text="***Apple Could Zig"/>
			<outline text="In the meeting with Amelio I asked why they are still pushing OpenDoc and CyberDog. I wished they would give it up, really turn the corner and focus all their attention on the growth that's possible thru the net. "/>
			<outline text="Focus on Eudora, Claris Emailer, Netscape, MSIE, BBEdit, PageMill, PhotoShop, Director, Fetch, Anarchie, StuffIt, WebStar, FileMaker. The Finder and Frontier. What a lineup!"/>
			<outline text="Cut your losses Gil, I said, OpenDoc was a head-trippy self-centered strategy to make something new happen, back before Apple knew that the net was the next growth area. "/>
			<outline text="My advice to Amelio: get behind Netscape. Work with Microsoft if you can. Define the perfect client machine. Work with other developers to define the perfect content development and server platform. "/>
			<outline text="Look to developers for trail-blazing. Improve your odds. No one will follow Apple now. It's time for Apple to learn to work with other developers. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has this down. But Microsoft is pushing it's own net integration APIs. Apple, uniquely, can afford to support Netscape and other developers. That's what I thought I heard Tesler say earlier."/>
			<outline text="Apple could zig while Microsoft zags."/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="So why did Amelio look so puzzled?"/>
			<outline text="***A bombshell"/>
			<outline text="He said it was the other way around. Netscape was implementing the OpenDoc APIs. "/>
			<outline text="I had missed something earlier in the day during Tesler's 90-minute presentation on Apple's Internet strategy. I had taken a break. I missed Marc Andreessen on stage. I didn't even know he had been there."/>
			<outline text="Amelio said that Netscape was supporting OpenDoc. I looked at him in disbelief. No way! That would be the dog wagging the tail. Ooops. The other way around."/>
			<outline text="Booom! The sound of a bombshell. "/>
			<outline text="Wheeeee!"/>
			<outline text="***Mail with Marc"/>
			<outline text="Later, I sent an email to Andreessen: &quot;I missed your speech at WWDC today. What did you say about OpenDoc and Netscape? What I heard: Netscape will be an OD server. You'll be able to launch Netscape and have it display inside an OD window. Why is this a big deal? Aren't you selling out to Apple? Does OD make a difference? Clearly you must think it does. Educate me!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="He replied: &quot;We're going to take Navigator and expose chunks of it as OpenDoc parts.  Certainly the browser window, perhaps other parts. It's a 6-12 month thing; we're working with their folks to figure out what exactly to do."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The primary motivation is that we need to componentize the Navigator anyway, for developers and for some OEMs.  One way we'll probably do that is by making Navigator a plug-in itself. But this is another way."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Selling out to Apple?  I don't think so... mostly we're trying to support Apple. I know how swell you think Microsoft is these days :-), but if there's only one OS vendor out there, that's not very good for us."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The other thing that happened today is that Apple said that the Navigator plug-in API would be a way to create OpenDoc parts. That is, any Navigator plug-in automatically works as an OpenDoc part. I think that's kinda cool."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Please let me know what you think of this -- I guess we think we were doing the right thing :-)&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***What a world!"/>
			<outline text="Oy! Can you handle it? Netscape is a Netscape plug-in. I think that only a true geek can appreciate how recursive this is. Recursive humor! There's an idea. "/>
			<outline text="It gets better. Apple has a OpenDoc container that's a Netscape plugin. And Apple has an OpenDoc part that runs Netscape plugins. "/>
			<outline text="Marc wants to know what I think. Right now I'm confused! I wish Marc and Larry would unwind some of this recursion. The market needs exactly one API here. If Netscape is wholehearted in their support of developers and the market, they're going to have to resolve this confusion somehow. "/>
			<outline text="Strategically, Apple is the smaller player here. People will follow Netscape. So Marc, I'm confused. I'll keep doing content tools. I'll stay away from plugins and parts for now at least."/>
			<outline text="About Microsoft, I'm praising them these days because they're taking Mac development seriously. That's not meant to detract from Netscape. I believe if Netscape hadn't done a Mac browser there would be no more energy in the Mac platform now. I also think Microsoft would have been able to head you off if you hadn't done a Mac version. "/>
			<outline text="Hey -- I'd be interested in hearing what Microsoft thinks of your deal with Apple. I bet I get an email from Bill Gates. I'll let you know."/>
			<outline text="***Mason's email"/>
			<outline text="Mason Hale, hale@onr.com, is one of the heroes of the Frontier scripting community. Mason made Frontier work with WebStar and other servers like NetPresenz. "/>
			<outline text="Mason is my buddy, I like working with him, we support each other and we use each other's tools. He's a young man, like so many of the of the people that the web has attracted to the Mac platform. He's part of a new generation that's just as energized as my generation was when the Mac first came out in the mid eighties."/>
			<outline text="Mason sent me an email yesterday: &quot;I wanted to make sure you saw Apple's press release titled 'Apple Bolsters Macintosh as Premier Web Site Creation Platform with Broad Third-Party Tools Support'. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;It doesn't mention Frontier at all. Worse, it promotes this lame hack from Main Event called Dog Patch that adds 'psuedo-threading' to AppleScript. What it really does is hold Apple Events in a queue, then sends them one at a time to AppleScript CGIs so they don't choke in multi-threaded environments."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The real story here is that Frontier adds true multi-threading to AppleScript CGIs. AppleScript people need to hear that message. My new CGI Framework makes it absolutely painless to move AppleScript CGIs into Frontier.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Mason wants me to tell Apple to get with the program and start selling the best tools. Done. I believe that the new Amelio-run Apple isn't scared of me or Mason or Frontier. I see this press release as a vestige of the old Apple. The new Apple, I think, wants the best technology. "/>

			<outline text="PPPS: Yes, Tesler was wearing a WebEdge t-shirt. Smart!"/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: Amelio, in his WWDC opening speech, said that he was giving $20 million to Heidi Roizen, heidi@applelink.apple.com, to spend promoting developer's products. That's a lot of money!"/>

			<outline text="***English is a Crazy Language, author unknown"/>
			<outline text="Let's face it -- English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat. "/>
			<outline text="We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. "/>
			<outline text="And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one loose tooth, 2 leese teeth? One index, 2 indices? "/>
			<outline text="Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a single annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it? "/>
			<outline text="If teachers taught, why didn't preacher praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue? "/>
			<outline text="Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo or a truck by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on driveways and drive on parkways? Lift a thumb to thumb a lift? Table a plan in order to plan a table?"/>

Have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited love? Have you  ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable? And where are all those people who *are* spring chickens or who would actually hurt a fly? "/>
			<outline text="You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you  fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on. Why is &quot;crazy man&quot; an insult, while to insert a comma and say &quot;crazy, man!&quot; is a compliment (as when applauding a jazz performance.)"/>
			<outline text="English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all).

			<outline text="Writing docs is like introducing your son or daughter to their future wife or husband. A parent shouldn't do that. It can come out all wrong."/>
			<outline text="So. I've been in doc-writing mode. Oy! Doc writing is more fun nowadays, with the web as the medium instead of paper and plain text files (no links!). Software guys like to write software, not *about* software. But a website is more like software, so it's more fun for software writers like me."/>
			<outline text="Doc writing puts me in a different mood. I want to explain things. In great detail! Hmmm. That works for software docs, but it doesn't work for DaveNet, where I skim over details, leave out a lot of facts, leave a lot of puns in, and just let my ideas reverberate around, without the benefit of complete logical arguments behind them."/>
			<outline text="I've always wanted a chance to present a software product exactly as I see it, without having to teach anyone how to use it. To connect the dots in DaveNet style, leaving out detail -- telling you how I conceived the software, not how I want you to perceive it.

I can't wait for people to see the feature. Watch this! my spirit says."/>
			<outline text="If I use a software product, I like to read the words of the author of the product. Peter Lewis is a funny guy! Chuck Shotton is a salesman. Rich Siegel is a shortstop. I'd like to have coffee with Aretha Franklin someday, but it may never happen. But I do know some excellent developers. Some write software for Windows and Unix. They may copy my ideas. So what? It's respect! And that's always cooool."/>
			<outline text="I'm also a web developer. I've done some cool sites. So I want to share my  design with other web developers. Maybe they work on Windows or Unix? With this spec, they know what to ask for from the people who do Perl implementations or Visual Basic add-ons."/>
			<outline text="I like sharing my ideas with my peers. So this piece is written for the people who develop software and sites. Everyone else is welcome to read it too."/>
			<outline text="***How Frontier 4.0 came about"/>
			<outline text="I've always wanted to build websites entirely within the Frontier environment. I felt that the hierarchic nature of Frontier, and the tools it offers -- its outliner, structured tables, data storage and text storage, it's scripting engine, it's connections -- would be a good match for the worldwide web. "/>
			<outline text="It was a puzzle, an elusive solution. I iterated a bunch of times. First there was AutoWeb, which used the Finder to outline a website. Then Clay Basket which was, itself, an outliner. It got easier, but as Clay grew it got harder."/>
			<outline text="I experimented with content -- DaveNet via email, then DaveNet via the web. I wrote a BBS that ran on the web. I made Frontier's database browsable thru the web. Then I did the 24 Hours project, which turned all my lightbulbs on! Now, finally, I'm doing my website development entirely within Frontier. Davey likes it."/>
			<outline text="I had initially hoped to create something that would be totally end-user, not just for script-oriented people. Like a lot of developers who played around with this stuff last year, I discovered that website management is inherently a scripted thing; especially if you're doing a large site that's dynamic. If you're doing a small site, three or four pages, use PageMill; it works great for smaller sites. But if you're doing a larger site, we can do some stuff to make it work better. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;***Here's the scenario"/>
			<outline text="A webmaster at a large university. Her public relations department insists on a standard look for pages, but they haven't decided what the look will be. The site presents the school's course schedule. A database of events that roll thru a home page. Sub-sites for each faculty member, written by the faculty member. Departmental home pages."/>
			<outline text="That's the market I'm entering, and hope to define. Large sites that are dynamic with lots of authors. A standardized look that's easy to change. Everyone uses their favorite text tools. The sysop has full control over the look and flow of the site. All the links are correct without employing a small army of link checkers."/>
			<outline text="There are six key features that make this system work: rendering, glossaries, templates, macros, an object hierarchy and connections to standard tools. Each of them is a separate story, and they connect with each other. Here goes!"/>
			<outline text="***Rendering"/>
			<outline text="A key new concept: pages are rendered. There's a difference between the text you edit and the HTML text that the system spits out. This presents a problem: where do you put the originals and where do you put rendered text? Every website management tool has this problem. Our solution: the source text resides in Frontier, and the rendered text resides on the website."/>
			<outline text="Text can flow into Frontier from any number of sources: databases, text editors, page layout programs, photo editing programs. It's fully programmable so you can make text move into Frontier anyway you like. And we have a complement of competent editors so you can do a lot of editing entirely within the environment."/>
			<outline text="We connect to the website either thru FTP or thru the file system. Since the Mac file system is LAN-aware, this means that you can set it up so your rendered text automatically goes to the right folder on the server if you serve from a machine that's on your LAN. The connection thru FTP is almost as convenient."/>
			<outline text="To preview a page, a very necessary feature, we create a temporary file nested deep in the System Folder. You can't test the links in this environment, but you can iterate over the layout and appearance of the page before moving it to the website."/>
			<outline text="***Glossaries"/>
			<outline text="Glossaries make link management work. A glossary is a simple lookup table. Each item has a name and a text value. When a page is rendered, any text inside &quot;double-quotes&quot; passes thru the glossary. If the term is defined, its associated text is substituted. "/>
			<outline text="The glossary is an elegant approach to the problem that link validator software attempts to solve. By concentrating most or all of your links in the glossary, you can make a change in one place, rebuild your pages, and all your links are cool. A glossary gives you the power to correct URLs in one place."/>
			<outline text="It's easy to add URLs to the glossary by choosing a menu item from Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer."/>
			<outline text="Some people have objected to the use of double-quotes, saying it interferes with a writer's process. But I'm a writer, and I love it! I've never heard a prose writer complain about this, just script writers. If you quote something that isn't in the glossary, the renderer leaves it alone. Sometimes it enables text that I wasn't expecting it to. I usually chuckle, and then put a backslash before the double-quote, which turns rendering off for the term. But often it surprises me by doing exactly the right thing. I laugh even louder when this happens!"/>
			<outline text="***Templates"/>
			<outline text="A template defines the wrapper for each web page. It says what text surrounds the body of the page. This makes it easy to define a standard look for pages, and then change the definition later. To make a change, you change the template, and rebuild the site."/>
			<outline text="Templates also make it easy to factor out overhead tags in HTML text, things like &amp;lt;body&gt;, &amp;lt;head&gt;, &amp;lt;title&gt;. Editors and writers will probably appreciate this. But it's up to the sysop to determine how much or how little of the look of a page is controlled by the rendering process."/>
			<outline text="I learned a lot about templates in MORE. The Library feature in MORE is a one-time-only approach to standardization. The new approach in Frontier 4.0 recalculates the text each time the page is rendered. It's much closer to what I want. Maybe it's everything that I want. We'll see."/>
			<outline text="***Macros"/>
			<outline text="As long as we're passing text thru a page renderer, why not allow the full power of the scripting environment and all its connections to show thru? Exactly! "/>
			<outline text="Macros allow you to include little scripts in your HTML text. The renderer evaluates the scripts and replaces them with the text they return. A macro is any text enclosed in \&amp;#123;curly braces&amp;#125;. As with glossary terms, you can escape this function by preceding a \&amp;#123; with a \\."/>
			<outline text="Macros give the sysop control of complicated pieces of HTML that must appear inside the document, or might change every time the page is rendered. All professionally-run sites need macros. Some web authoring systems running on Unix already have them. I know this for sure, this is the most powerful macro facility for web development on the Macintosh."/>
			<outline text="***Hierarchy"/>
			<outline text="Hierarchy is the opposite of anarchy, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way! Hierarchy is a very religious concept. I'm getting ready for some debates on this subject. Interesting ones!"/>
			<outline text="Late in the development process for Frontier 4.0, I noticed that glossaries could be hierarchic; that a table could contain a glossary that overrides the definitions in any higher-level table. When I started using this, I realized that I now have an object-oriented website! Oh man that was fun. Object oriented is a powerful way to do websites. It gives everything a place. That one change in thinking made the design glitches disappear. "/>
			<outline text="Websites really become software. Eventually everything in the Frontier web scripting environment will work with hierarchic overrides. To explain this fully would require a tutorial on website building. Watch the website. The story is still developing."/>
			<outline text="I don't think they have anything like this on Windows or Unix."/>
			<outline text="***Standard Tools"/>
			<outline text="Let's move from the sublime to the concrete."/>
			<outline text="I've said this over and over in DaveNets, the Mac OS has an advantage over other platforms because it has mature interapplication protocols that are supported by the Internet clients, content tools and servers. From browsers to email clients and databases, to web servers and FTP servers, (almost!) everything is scriptable, so text, pictures and data can move from where it exists to the place you want it. That's how the Internet works, and that's how it works inside our machines too. "/>
			<outline text="Windows may have interapplication protocols, but the apps don't have the scripting religion yet. On the Mac, the technology is mature and supported in System 7. Nothing to wait for. It's available now."/>
			<outline text="Even better -- category-based standards have emerged, not by edict as Apple bet they would -- they happened thru market power and leadership, as it always works in the software world."/>
			<outline text="An example. Microsoft emulates the scripting interface defined by Netscape, so much so that you can change Netscape.id to 'MSIE' and the scripts work!"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has this strategy down. Embrace and extend! You can call MSIE a &quot;Netscape-compatible&quot; browser. Where do we go from here? Microsoft gets a say in that, because they did the right thing, and preserved the investment that script writers have already made in Netscape. They showed us respect, and they have earned our respect in return."/>
			<outline text="I asked Marc Andreessen, the founder of Netscape, what he thought about this. He said &quot;We think it's really great that Microsoft has chosen to emulate our Mac Navigator scripting interface, as it provides a clear path for developers to take. Anything that inspires developers to do great stuff is good for Netscape, and standards as always are key.&quot; So Netscape gets the respect of Macintosh script writers too. Thanks Marc!"/>
			<outline text="So, I followed Microsoft's example and embraced and extended AppleScript. It was fun! That's fully discussed on the Frontier website. It's how you lead a market. Welcome AppleScript, we say. It's a standard. Coool. Now where do we go from here? Frontier has a lot to say about that."/>
			<outline text="***Politics"/>
			<outline text="I promised to write my own version of the Internet strategy for the Mac platform. I still want to do it. But not this weekend. I'll be attending Apple's press conference tomorrow. I will listen and possibly ask questions. Believe it or not I have a meeting with Gil Amelio tomorrow. I'll let you know how it goes."/>
			<outline text="At Apple, they have just a clue that something interesting is happening over here. But they're still focused over there. I think that will change! They have a new religion at Apple, they say. Developers count. Cooool. But even if they aren't being totally truthful, there's a way to make all this stuff happen without Apple's support."/>
			<outline text="Remember, they licensed the OS to Motorola and IBM, who in turn can license it to other manufacturers. If Apple doesn't want to promote the most powerful tools on the Mac platform, in favor of their own tools, so be it. I'm betting that we can find partners for this software. But, if we could get Apple to sing our song, just a little bit, we could make some growth happen here."/>
			<outline text="And even if that doesn't happen -- I do software for sport. Like a professional golfer or tennis player. I like to come up with new strokes! So my mission is already accomplished, even if the Mac platform should die, as some people say it surely will. That's the wild card that other writers aren't taking into account. They think all software developers are motivated by money and market share. My claim -- only the ones that make boring software. If you love to make software, you make it happen where ever it can happen. "/>
			<outline text="If you doubt me, check out the worldwide web, which was created on the Next platform in the early nineties. A truly dead platform that turned the world upside down! Yeah, if you think it's about market share, you haven't been paying attention."/>
			<outline text="Still digging!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Frontier 4.0 is free. Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="PPS: Qualification: Adobe PhotoShop is not scriptable. It would be great if it were."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Microsoft's Web Outliner&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/17/96; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A quick DaveNet..."/>
			<outline text="In the last piece, &quot;A Curiosity&quot;, in a postscript, I said: &quot;Microsoft is doing a file system browser for Windows. Where will the equivalent functionality come from for the Mac? Netscape? Apple? Microsoft? Somewhere else? Hmmmm..&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I said this too quickly. Here's what I really meant."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has been demoing a web browser for Windows that provides an expandable outline of network resources. It's a tall narrow part of the browser window, to the left of the page you're looking at. It displays the hierarchy of web pages that got you to the page. You can navigate in high gear using their outliner."/>
			<outline text="You can also browse your local file system in the outline. It flattens out the differences between net resources and local resources. It's part of what web browsers do, integrate the local file system with the net, but it's taken to a level beyond that offered by Netscape and others."/>
			<outline text="No browser on the Mac platform has this capability. I have seen NetFinder. It's nice, but not even remotely close to what I'm talking about. I asked what Netscape's plans are; they expect to provide this, but it wasn't clear if they will do it for the Mac, or when it will ship."/>
			<outline text="It's possible that Microsoft plans to offer this capability on the Mac, but I asked Paul Maritz, a Microsoft exec, this question at a press conference in March, and he said no; that it was up to Apple. It's possible that he may not have understood the question."/>
			<outline text="Based on the email I've been getting from people in the Mac community, they don't understand that this feature is in the Microsoft browser for Windows. It's not a small feature. It's not the Finder, it's the integration that counts. The Finder doesn't allow you to browse the net. "/>
			<outline text="It's important that Apple execs not miss this. Thru 1996, the Mac and Windows are roughly at parity in OS integration features with the Internet. Microsoft is planning to pass Apple, has demonstrated their intention publicly, however Apple appears not to be aware of it. Their stated Internet strategy does not take it into account."/>
			<outline text="***Honorable mention"/>
			<outline text="I am very impressed with Apple's new web presence!"/>
			<outline text="http://www.apple.com/."/>
			<outline text="A tremendous leap forward."/>
			<outline text="Credit where credit is due."/>
			<outline text="I wonder what tools they're using?"/>
			<outline text="***New role for Alsop"/>
			<outline text="Congratulations and best wishes to Stewart Alsop, who is leaving InfoWorld to become a partner at New Enterprise Associates, a Baltimore venture capital firm."/>
			<outline text="He will continue to write his personal column for InfoWorld, and run IDG's Agenda conference. "/>
			<outline text="Stewart should do well as a venture capitalist because he is passionate about technology and people."/>
			<outline text="***Apple, Java, Natural Intelligence, Microsoft, MetroWerks"/>
			<outline text="I received email yesterday from Chris Evans, evans@natural.com, saying that Natural Intelligence had closed a deal with Apple to license their Java Runtime environment for inclusion in the Macintosh operating system. A press release is expected today. "/>
			<outline text="If this proves true, it's a boon for Natural Intelligence, a small development and consulting company in Cambridge, MA; and a blow to Symantec, Metrowerks (and Sun?) all of whom make Macintosh runtime environments for Java apps."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is making deals too. They announced on Tuesday that MetroWerks would provide the ActiveX runtime environment on the Macintosh. "/>
			<outline text="What's Symantec doing? "/>
			<outline text="Sun?"/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/21/96; 7:55:53 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- I moved! Logically not physically. New tools, a new server, a new system for releasing stuff via email and the web. "/>
			<outline text="It's time to change your bookmarks. "/>
			<outline text="The DaveNet website is now at http://www.scripting.com/davenet/."/>
			<outline text="A great new look and structure. The front page shows you the current piece. Scan down the left edge of the page for pointers to the structure. Back-issues outlines for three years, and a page that tells you how the website works."/>
			<outline text="It's a large dynamic website. As dynamic as I can be. It's like watching an ant farm. I hope you come visit my new site. I'll be lookin for you in my log!"/>
			<outline text="***I hate animated graphics"/>
			<outline text="Let's hear a big groan for animated graphics on pages that contain text that you're supposed to read! People who put moving things on pages of prose don't have a clue how people work. Your eye can't stay with the flow of the text if stuff is moving. Animated icons are fine on structure pages -- but be aware that people are going to be distracted. Animation on web pages is as annoying as &amp;lt;blink&gt;ing text."/>
			<outline text="Hey I liked the old suck interface! It was easy. Sometimes I didn't like the negativism of the Suck editorials. But it was an easy site to check out. Low bandwidth. A quick skim to see what they're talking about, check out a few of the pointers, and then onto CNN and a few other of my standard sites. Suck was part of my daily tour."/>
			<outline text="But Suck had to mess with a good thing. Not only do they have animated graphics (they're beautiful by the way, a rotating 7Up can, for example) but they also use frames! Oy I hate to k'vetch (no I don't) but how can you read a Suck piece without the Page Down key? For some reason when you have a Frame on a page, the Page Down key doesn't work in Netscape. Yuck!"/>
			<outline text="So here I am trying to stay in the Suck loop, being distracted by beautiful moving graphics and having my brain cells burnt by frames. They're fighting with me! And all I did was love them... Hmmm. What do they want over there in SuckLand? Can't tell."/>
			<outline text="***HotWired's presence"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, just as I'm leaving HotWired they change their home page to work the way I always wanted it to work. I'd get a scoop, like Steve Wozniak on the record about his disappointment with Apple, and HotWired has no place to put it. "/>
			<outline text="Now they have a front page that's interesting, it's not just a table of contents for the website. This is the way front pages should be. Structure, of course. But room for news. That's how newspapers work. The table of contents isn't as important as the headlines. HotWired finally got it. Gambatte!"/>
			<outline text="***Apple's presence"/>
			<outline text="In the last piece I complimented Apple's webmasters on pulling off a great transformation in Apple's web presence. Last Monday, it seemed that all of Apple's websites changed to the new look, in one apparently synchronous switch. "/>
			<outline text="I gulped! Maybe they have better tools than mine? Sounds like automation to me. No one likes to compete with the platform vendor, especially when they did it right. "/>
			<outline text="Well, it turns out that they don't have automated tools. It was done with huge amounts of human labor. In the meantime, they deserve huge congratulations for having made something big happen. Big things always require great focus and committment and talent. It was really well done. Good job!"/>
			<outline text="***Java Java Java"/>
			<outline text="If you say Java again I'm going to puke!"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- have you noticed that there's very little Java content around the web? I think people are too busy building their sites to think too much about Java. And readers are bouncing in and out. Who has the time to wait two minutes for the Java applet to load, only to find out it's some cute little icon that does NOTHING and consumes bandwidth, and pulls my attention from what I went there for?"/>
			<outline text="I noticed this a few weeks ago when I was looking for an update to QualComm's Eudora emailer program. They had a link on their home page to a fancy Java version of the home page. Come look! they say. See how cool we are. Well, maybe next visit, when I have more time. Right now I just want the software."/>
			<outline text="I was once quoted in Upside, http://www.upside.com/, anonymously, saying that General Magic's MagicCap OS was like a waitress who made her personality the issue instead of the food. The metaphor was actually a bit more colorful. "/>
			<outline text="The same applies to the web. I came here to get my work done; I love what I'm doing, so please don't distract me with stuff that isn't important. Gratuitous distracting glitz is no more appropriate in a website than it is in a productivity app."/>
			<outline text="So the next time someone says they have the fastest justin-time Java byte-code garbage collector, be sure to ask them what you should use Java for. I haven't heard a good answer to this question, and I've been asking. If I'm missing something, could someone please point me to a website that has pointers to ten websites with useful uses of Java. Technology demos don't count. I'm talking about real utility."/>
			<outline text="Java got a good start, but now it seems to be languishing in the same place that all software industry grand initiatives end up. Programmers understand Java, but these programmers don't grok the web. Web designers are psyched about Java because they always buy the snake oil that programmers sell. Maybe this time they won't let us down? "/>
			<outline text="Nahhh. Java is just a programming language. My advice to all the proponents of Java: stop everything you're doing, and put up your own website. Make it interesting without Java. Now, tell me, why do you need or want Java?"/>
			<outline text="Or, help me see the light -- visit the DaveNet site and tell me how I should be using Java. I'm definitely open to suggestions."/>
			<outline text="***Thin Browsers"/>
			<outline text="InfoWorld is touting yesterday's announcement of the Network Computer as historic. I'm upset because I wasn't invited to the party! Could someone please tell someone in Netscape or Sun PR that I am a journalist, even if I work on the web; or maybe especially because I work on the web. I want to cover these events, not read other reporter's accounts of them."/>
			<outline text="Never mind. I read the accounts, yes FTP, HTTP, etc are standards. If a machine supports them (what machine doesn't?) that's a good thing. "/>
			<outline text="But the most interesting news of the day, for me at least, was Netscape's announcement of a &quot;thin&quot; Navigator. I think I'll use that one on my 64 megabyte PowerMac 9500. I'm not kidding. "/>
			<outline text="The need for a thin web browser is real. I'd like websites to be calmer, more subtle, and more informative. If the majority of users didn't have a fat browser, web content people wouldn't be so distracted by fat features. We'd have more interesting content. There are still lots of great ideas out there that haven't been done yet. And maybe the money would focus on what's important."/>
			<outline text="***Amelio on Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="At the Apple press conference a week ago, I asked Gil Amelio, Apple's new CEO, what makes a Macintosh different from a Windows machine. It was the usual &quot;user experience&quot; thing. He said that it was the way everything worked together, and how nice the whole system is, the gestalt of the thing. "/>
			<outline text="Later Amelio asked what I thought the differentiator was. I didn't give him an answer. Now I'd like to."/>
			<outline text="There are two major differentiators: maturity and integration. "/>
			<outline text="It's the difference between promises and benefits. The Mac delivers benefits; Windows makes promises. Maturity means the powerful integration features of the operating system are effectively exploited by developer's Internet client, content and server apps."/>
			<outline text="The other differentiator is that Apple makes both hardware and software. Microsoft understands this. Check out my report from the Windows 95 announcement, &quot;A WorldWide Trance&quot;, 8/27/95. Microsoft is always frustrated by their OEMs. When Microsoft asks them to jump, they often tell Microsoft to take a hike."/>
			<outline text="Apple, on the other hand, theoretically, can integrate features of software and hardware because the people all work for the same boss. So plug and play really works on the Mac. This is a major advantage. Even geekish users like me don't like opening the box and farting around with dip switches and mother boards. That's part of the &quot;user experience&quot; on Intel boxes. If I don't like animated graphics, how do you think I feel about dip switches? Hmmmm."/>
			<outline text="The assumption in the Mac community is that Microsoft is all-powerful. This is a misperception. They can be frustrated. They are fallible. Check out their claims. Sometimes they overstate their strength. It's up to Apple's CEO to spot this and let his troops, which includes users and developers, spread the word."/>
			<outline text="***The Amelio Question"/>
			<outline text="Apple has had five CEOs: Mike Scott, Steve Jobs, John Sculley, Mike Spindler and now Gil Amelio. Sculley is the central man. He, more than anyone, determined the character of the Apple Computer that's so deeply in trouble right now. "/>
			<outline text="Sculley served the priesthood instead of vice versa. They tolerated him because he signed the checks and didn't interfere. There are horror stories about engineers who were given huge bonuses to keep them from quitting. Markets were re-directed around the immature whims of some pretty ineffective people. "/>
			<outline text="They didn't have to compete in the market to have their ideas gain traction. There was a huge conflict of interest between Apple employees and their shareholders. The internal people ate the platform's seed corn, putting developers out of business for the cause of justifying their jobs. "/>
			<outline text="Sculley's legacy is a wrecked market, a wasted lead, and a very sick company.There are still some vestiges of the old Apple. Believe it or not, I'm currently involved in a struggle with Apple, one that's very similar to the old struggles. They aren't paying attention to what I'm doing and are making plans to do exactly what I do. They have announced their plans to the development community. I look at their blueprint and realize that they're talking about five years of expensive development. I know because I've already done the work."/>
			<outline text="So the big question -- can Mr. Amelio get Apple's internal development people under control? Get them to respond to market needs, but most important, get them to work with, and stay out of the way of, this developer?"/>
			<outline text="What more could they want from me? There is no Windows version of Frontier. We just shipped version 4.0, and quickly followed it with a 4.0.1 update. My software is free, so they couldn't possibly covet my revenue stream, there is none! It's true, the ideas are compelling (thanks!) but why should they compete with me? And why should they waste their R&amp;D money on benefits that can only come years from now, when the market and software are ready right now? It's the classic Apple-developer struggle. In the context of 1996's disastrous losses."/>
			<outline text="So far it sounds like it's an OpenDoc thing. I'm vocal about not wanting to invest in OpenDoc personally. I live in a bigger world, or a different one. The Mac is my machine, but Apple is not my religion. I'm independent in the truest sense. I make up my own mind. But this makes them want to FUD me. Who does he think he is! they scream. We'll show him!"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- my opinions are my own, and my money is mine to invest where I choose. But Frontier tends to not care whether it's being used to script OpenDoc or AppleScript or ActiveX or Java or Netscape or MSIE or WebStar or Eudora or whatever anyone may come up with. "/>
			<outline text="Just because I don't choose to invest in OpenDoc, doesn't mean Apple can't make Frontier drive OpenDoc apps. We generally tend to listen to people who invest in our platform. So if Apple needs some tweaks or extensions to make this work, we'd be inclined to make them. Especially if they threw us a few bucks to do the work. A lot less money than Chris Espinosa wants for his all-new AppleScript team."/>
			<outline text="***In the following paragraph I vent a little anger..."/>
			<outline text="I made a promise to myself and to Amelio. No more lies. I'm not happy because Apple is validating my market. That's software industry BS.  Their interference in my business is not welcome. After all I've done for the Macintosh, I'd like them to at least evaluate my software before deciding it's irrelevent. I'm humbled, OK? Now let's get some work done!"/>
			<outline text="Cool. Glad to get that off my chest."/>
			<outline text="***Case study in Amelio"/>
			<outline text="I'm treating this as a case study in Amelio. I will include you and Apple's shareholders in the loop. There's a difference this time around the infinite loop. I have a voice. How is Apple is spending their R&amp;D money? How much reality there is in their words of support for Mac developers? Are they serving the interests of their shareholders or serving their personal fears? I'll let you know."/>
			<outline text="I can tell you this much -- a $740 million loss and a new CEO hasn't managed to penetrate the consciousness of some of Apple's internal development people. They appear to still think it's about them. They need a wakeup call, and if Gil doesn't deliver it, where is Apple? "/>
			<outline text="From the artist in me -- why bother struggling with the Mac platform when the platform vendor seems still to have to prove that it's their brilliance that makes the lights shine in this world? "/>
			<outline text="In other words, why take any creative risks when they're going to claim all the credit?"/>
			<outline text="I'm asking myself these questions right now. And in the tradition of this column, I will, of course, share my experiences with you."/>
			<outline text="I'm not going to blast at Amelio in public right now, I'm going to give him a chance to make the difference that no Apple CEO has ever been able to make so far: to get Apple's internal people to respect and work with Macintosh developers."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Something Apple could do: make the filesystem faster. It's the performance bottleneck of Mac web servers and content systems. It's still 68K, multiple layers of legacy code. Rather than inventing new metaphors, Apple people could roll up their sleeves and come up with a fast native storage system, or license one. (Clue: I have one.)"/>
			<outline text="PPS: My terseness has become an issue on various mailing lists. I'm always terse in email. Gotta be. Saves the writing energy for Frontier docs and DaveNets. I do the best I can with the time I have. Respectfully, I hope this is cool."/>

			<outline text="Two products collide in the market. If one developer is larger than the other, you get FUD. Or Embrace &amp; Extend."/>
			<outline text="FUD is an acronym for fear, uncertainty and doubt. It's the way an older brother treats a younger brother. Step out of line and he beats you up. Make other people choose. Go with me because I'm stronger, says the older brother. The younger one is too scared to object."/>
			<outline text="Get to know a younger brother. Get to know an older one. You'll see what I mean. I paralyze my kid brother with fear. Any way he moves I get there first. Eventually he gives up. Eventually there's just an older brother. "/>
			<outline text="But then something can happen that changes the equation. The brothers can grow up. "/>
			<outline text="Then they give up FUD for Embrace &amp; Extend. It's a more mature strategy. It involves seduction, not violence. You recognize the accomplishments of the younger brother. You still compete with each other, but you give him a chance to win too."/>
			<outline text="The big brother learns that this makes his life better too. A game where both people can win is more fun than a game that no one can win. It's been proven. Many times!"/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="When Microsoft was younger they played the FUD game too. OS/2 was a discontinuity. They fixed the eight-character filename problem. Added a clipboard and a GUI. It was a modern operating system. But it was late! And it was a painful upgrade. Ooops. They didn't embrace the past. Even if you fail to embrace yourself, it's bad news."/>

They fudded the developers and the users, and themselves. The lack of growth in PC software created the window of opportunity for the Macintosh."/>

			<outline text="***Embrace &amp; Extend"/>
			<outline text="Now Microsoft has opted for Embrace &amp; Extend. It's all over their marketing literature. They use it in their speeches and slides. Embrace! Extend! They sneak it in when you aren't looking."/>
			<outline text="Embrace &amp; Extend means that Microsoft Word reads WordPerfect files. Excel runs Lotus spreadsheets. It means that Windows runs DOS applications. And Microsoft Internet Explorer emulates Netscape where ever possible. Java? Of course. Embrace and Extend! Both at the same time. Why not?"/>
			<outline text="Embrace &amp; Extend means always saying yes."/>
			<outline text="***Growing up"/>
			<outline text="Part of growing up means that you recognize that there are other people in the world. In order to Embrace &amp; Extend you must first realize that other people create cool things, even people in your own family, even things you didn't expect."/>
			<outline text="Embrace &amp; Extend works well, especially when you're the platform vendor and depend on other developers investing in the platform. Developers aren't fools. If they can't figure out how to make $130 million from being right before Microsoft is, they won't take any chances. Microsoft is a long-term player, so they can't afford to FUD everything that moves. If they did, their PE ratio wouldn't be as high as it is."/>
			<outline text="Embrace &amp; Extend is kinder. Markets don't have to wait for the platform vendor. Customers don't lose their investment when they switch. Customers aren't stupid either. They learn. If developers go out of business all the time, they wait and wait and then forget why they were waiting. They forget to invest. That's how markets die. "/>

			<outline text="I'm tired. I spent the last two months in crunch mode shipping Frontier 4.0, then 4.0.1. This was on top of a year and a half of research into the art of web content development. My bet was that the Mac would turn out to be the best platform for building large dynamic sites with lots of authors."/>
			<outline text="From a technology standpoint, it turned out that way! It's exciting. I believe I've finally reached nirvana in website building. It's all happening on the Mac."/>

			<outline text="I did this work while they were embroiled in internal conflict at Apple. Losing huge amounts of money. Shipping system software that didn't work. Completely missing every wakeup call that the net was offering. If you doubt me, read the back issues of DaveNet. "/>

			<outline text="My dream: someday I'll deliver a great product for the Mac, and Apple will thank me in a meaningful way instead of telling me to go away. But I'm dysfunctional! I believe anyway. I want to hit another Mac home run. I need to take a deep long look at this. Why? Can I ever win here?"/>

			<outline text="***Peter N Lewis"/>
			<outline text="Peter Lewis, peter@stairways.com.au, is one of the heroes of the Macintosh Internet software world. I depend on his software, so do a lot of other Mac users. Lewis went to Apple's developer conference, and he reads DaveNet. Here's what he said:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;I hear they plan to have personal web serving in 7.6. We shall see. It certainly makes me less inclined to grab Copland and start work on an FTP/HTTP server as soon as they release DR1. There isn't much point in doing that if they will have their own version when they ship 8.0."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The whole conference (while vastly improved on last year's feel) was still about Apple doing the big stuff and how developers could fit in to the cracks. Yeah, I want to write a little plug in for Apple's web server. Sure, I want to write a plug in for Apple's FTP client. Unhuh.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yaya! The attack was pretty universal. Without people like Peter Lewis, there would be no Internet strategy for Apple because there would be no Apple! In effect, Apple said, thanks Peter, we'll take over from here."/>
			<outline text="With Apple's recent track record at system software, remember Open Transport, we all lose if Peter doesn't keep NetPresenz and Anarchie up to date. But logically, we can't blame Peter for looking elsewhere for new challenges and new fun."/>
			<outline text="What about Chuck Shotton and WebStar? I don't plan on switching to Apple's server software. I bet most sysops feel the same way. Why fix it if it isn't broken? WebStar works. I wonder if Chuck will keep WebStar up to date?"/>
			<outline text="***Metrowerks"/>
			<outline text="We also noticed that Metrowerks, the company that shipped native PowerPC development tools when Apple had none, who saved Apple's butt bigtime, weren't included in Apple's Internet strategy."/>
			<outline text="Everyone uses their tools. It's likely that their Java virtual machine will be the best one for the Mac. There's a lot of power in Metrowerks. It's being left on the table by Apple. "/>

			<outline text="***See you in the market"/>
			<outline text="I want to be independent of Apple. I want to not care what they think. Without a big paradigm shift at Apple, there's no way to win with them."/>
			<outline text="So, my response to Apple -- see you in the market! We embrace AppleScript users. If you want to produce web content using the new features in Frontier 4.0, welcome! We speak AppleScript here. When Apple ships their content tools, take a look. Until then, know that my 4.0 isn't the end of the line. I've got a few more tricks up my sleeve. I'm sure some of them will wait for Apple. But I'm also sure that some won't. If Apple wants to ignore my stuff, fine. I'll bring my case right to the users. "/>
			<outline text="Users have tuned into the disaster area that Apple Computer is. They're getting independent too. Users will have to make a choice. You can thank Apple for that."/>

			<outline text="PPS: I hear the complaints from Apple's execs: Where is it safe for us to work? How can we move forward without alienating developers? Answer: make the file system faster. Get the bugs out of Copland. Add new slots to the Finder. Make our software run better and faster. And save money, give your shareholders a dividend! Invest in independent developers. Why do you have to employ so many software writers? With independent developers you get the code for free. And you cover markets you don't even see. Apple is ineffective at market development. Get smaller. Let your internal developers be the entrepreneurs they think they are. Set them free. Let them face the realities of the market by being part of the market, instead of being the market killers they try to be."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What Java is Saying&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/28/96; 6:30:35 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- I just had a revelation about Java."/>
			<outline text="I've been confused. I've even said so a few times in DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="I've asked what Java is about, and I've even gotten responses. "/>
			<outline text="Check out http://www.scripting.com/davenet/mail/. "/>
			<outline text="But last night a lightbulb went off. "/>
			<outline text="And of course I wanted to share it..."/>
			<outline text="***Remote Procedure Calls"/>
			<outline text="When I was a computer science grad student, in the late 1970s, we were ga-ga about an idea called Remote Procedure Calls or RPC. An application is distributed across a network, with pieces residing on different servers, presumably with different access privileges, allowing multiple authors to work on the same piece of software. RPC allows parts to be updated at will; and hopefully because of agreed-to interfaces, everything would keep working."/>
			<outline text="Before this dream was realized, I left for the world of microcomputer software where we were playing with user interfaces, and the network was something you connected to thru a slow phone line. There weren't any software interfaces to this network. It was something a person could use, thru CompuServe or AOL, but software couldn't build on it."/>
			<outline text="By the time LANs came about, I was already on the Mac. It had networking built-in, but the APIs were horrendous and the platform vendor was hogging the fast lane, so very little of its potential was developed. "/>
			<outline text="We tried again, we had a scriptable AppleLink client, but Apple wouldn't let it out. Oy. We couldn't work together. No nirvana! Wait one more generation..."/>
			<outline text="***What Java is Saying"/>
			<outline text="Now, with the addition of the Internet to personal computing, and its clean low-tech well-understood APIs, it's time to think about RPC again. The Internet is the vendorless platform. It's a groupware system. Let's try again. We can work together!"/>
			<outline text="That's what Java is saying."/>
			<outline text="***How it works"/>
			<outline text="A programmer can specify that a procedure lives on another server so it can be close to some resource, like a database or an email server. The procedure does queries or searches, compute-intensive things that would be too slow with a network connection inbetween. It delivers results to other parts that are running closer to the user, providing the responsiveness that users insist on."/>
			<outline text="When someone wants to run an app, it collects the parts it needs from the net, and runs. "/>
			<outline text="Software is an evolutionary process. RPC allows pieces of a problem to evolve separately. It allows responsibility to be allocated. The time between development and deployment is shorter. Seen this way, Java will be a software distribution system with a very short pipe."/>
			<outline text="***It's just nirvana!"/>
			<outline text="This has been the panacea of software as long as I've been involved in software. It's nirvana -- people communicating and getting along with each other; happily making each other richer, and more powerful. What more could you want from a computer? Hey -- what more could you want from life!"/>
			<outline text="So Java is attempting to address the ideal. The computer is a network. The resources available to users go beyond hard disks and screens and mice and keyboards; they include people. Other users become attached to our computers."/>
			<outline text="Of course this is just the promise of the Internet. It's a dazzling opportunity. But it's still a familiar problem. It's what everyone has been working on since we first started playing with computers. No wonder everyone is so excited. It's not about a language, it's about a decision to work with each other. Now we just have to learn how to do it! "/>
			<outline text="No single developer gets to do it all. That's the new idea! That's precious and it must be guarded. It's not about embracing and extending or fear uncertainty and doubt. Been there, done that. "/>
			<outline text="***Two classes of apps"/>
			<outline text="Apps written in Java will fall into two classes -- internal apps, running within a single organization, providing new access to internal information resources. Intranet apps. (Who came up with that term? It deserves a prize!)"/>
			<outline text="The other class is groupware communication apps: chatrooms and bulletin boards. They will be used to connect the Java community together. As the services evolve, they will open up to people who aren't writing in Java, but are using tools that written in and connect to Java. "/>
			<outline text="These two areas are consistent with what I see happening in the Java development community. And of course they meet up at a single place, where organizations internally use the same tools that are developed for public use."/>
			<outline text="***The trend"/>
			<outline text="In the software industry, we will all make our software bases relevent to the Java mission. That's what it's going to take to stay interesting. And being interesting has always been key to growth in the software business."/>
			<outline text="The first round of new relevence is in the area of development tools. Integrated development environments from companies like Symantec, Microsoft, Borland, Metrowerks and Natural Intelligence."/>
			<outline text="But you can see Java plugging into every type of software. It'll be interesting to see what people come up with."/>
			<outline text="***Struck a nerve"/>
			<outline text="In the last piece I said &quot;The power to bundle doesn't mean as much as it used to. People who use the net like to download software. It's fresher stuff!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It struck a nerve! With the net, software cycles are shorter. This is good and not good. Netscape has bloated. We expect crashy software. "/>
			<outline text="But we're seeing unprecedented progress in the software world. The pipe got shorter, that made a huge difference. With Java, the pipe moves to runtime. It'll be the shortest pipe ever. "/>
			<outline text="Can we handle this power? "/>
			<outline text="We'll see..."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I'm attending the JavaOne conference in San Francisco later this week. Please let me know if you're showing a product there. I'd love to see what's up."/>
			<outline text="PPS:  Nirvana is a state of perfect blessedness achieved by the extinction of individual existence. It's groupware!"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Panacea is a medicine that cures all diseases. No need for a panacea when you're in nirvana. We'll see..."/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: I want a great scriptable dictionary program for the Mac. Are they any out there? I'm not in nirvana. I'm still using a printed dictionary. Not cool!"/>

			<outline text="John Perry Barlow, barlow@eff.org, probably needs no introduction to this audience. Founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Grateful Dead lyricist and pounder of good and sometimes lost causes; Barlow speaks in lyrics, gets people angry, and makes fun of things that beg to be made fun of."/>
			<outline text="When I woke this morning I learned of the death of Timothy Leary thru this essay written by Barlow. It's beautiful. I wanted to share it with DaveNet readers."/>
			<outline text="***Long Live Timothy Leary by John Perry Barlow"/>
			<outline text="A couple of hours ago, at 12:45 am Beverly Hills time, my old friend and the corrupter of my youth Timothy Leary made good on his promise to &quot;give death a better name or die trying.&quot; Willingly, peacefully, and unafraid, he headed off on his last trip."/>
			<outline text="He spoke his last words a few hours before. On the phone to the mordant William S. Burroughs he said, &quot;I hope that someday I'm as funny as you are.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="He didn't, as threatened, commit suicide on the Net. Or have his head cut off and frozen. Or engage in any other the other spectacles of departure I had dreaded. In the end, he surrounded himself with the angelic band of twenty-somethings who have been uploading him into the Web these last few months and drifted peacefully out of here."/>
			<outline text="I was headed his way when he died. When I was with him earlier this month he said, &quot;When I leave here, Barlow, I want your face to be one of the last things I see.&quot; I think that was one of the sweetest things anyone ever said to me, and I was trying to make it possible, but death proved itself once again to be bigger and faster than either of us. The phone just rang in the middle of this rainy Wyoming night, and now I'm here naked in the dark trying to think of something to follow him out with."/>
			<outline text="Two years ago, Cynthia and I spent our last day together with Timmy. When she died the next day and it became so shockingly clear to both of us how strange this culture has become on the subject of the second commonest event in the world, how weirdly shameful is dying in America, we both thought it time to bring death out of the closet. I did so by grieving her, and continuing to grieve her, more publicly than is polite in a culture that claims for itself the ability to conquer and control everything."/>
			<outline text="But Timmy beat me to the barricades. He flat died. And he died, without pretending that he was &quot;really going to get well any day now,&quot; without permitting himself to become a ghoulish and futile medical experiment, without contributing to the stupefying mass denial that causes almost 80% of America's health care dollars to be blown on the last six months of life."/>
			<outline text="He died unashamed and having, as usual, a great time."/>
			<outline text="A few weeks ago, the denizens of leary.com and I rented a phalanx of wheel chairs and rode them with him into the House of Blues on Sunset Strip, a place that likely had never seen fifteen people in wheel chairs before. After a truly merry time, we were headed back to his house and on the way came within a smile of Tim Leary's Last Bust."/>
			<outline text="We cruised west on Sunset. And the sun was setting. The top was down on my metallic mauve rent-a-convertible. A couple of the web girls, Trudy and Camilla, were sitting on the trunk like psychedelic prom queens, shoop-de-booping to the funk station on the radio, volume at eleven. Both the girls were beautiful, Trudy like a character from Neuromancer, Camilla like a character from Botticelli. The air was sweet and soft as a negligee on our faces, and the light had that elegiac quality that makes people think LA might not be so bad after all."/>
			<outline text="Timmy gave me a high five and grinned. &quot;Life is good!&quot; he shouted over the music. As I looked up to meet his raised hand, I saw in my rear view mirror, past the swaying torsos of the girls, the rotating reds of a real Beverly Hills cop."/>
			<outline text="Of course we were in possession of several of those substances that we considered safe and effective but which this culture, in another of its dangerous madnesses, has declared lethal, probably to distract heat from its own deadly drugs of choice. Furthermore, I had only recently paid an astonishingly steep California fine for allowing a friend to stand up through the sunroof of a car I was driving."/>
			<outline text="He pulled us over in front of the Beverly Hills Hotel. He looked like an Eagle Scout."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Officer,&quot; I said, nodding back at the still improperly seated girls, &quot;I know what we were doing was wrong. But you see, my friend here is dying, and we're trying to show him a good time.&quot; Timmy, without saying anything, smiled sheepishly at the cop and nodded, caught in the act."/>
			<outline text="He looked like hell but he sure looked happy."/>
			<outline text="The officer gazed into Timmy's beatific skull-face and lost his starch. &quot;Well,&quot; he said to the girls, &quot;I'd be lying if I didn't say that looks like fun, but just because he's dying doesn't mean you should. Now get down in the seat and buckle up and I'll let you go.&quot; I felt like honest death had just made one of its first converts."/>
			<outline text="In thirty years of following Tim Leary around, he's given me some wonderful and hair-raising moments. He has been father, anti-father, partner-in-crime, and devout fellow-worshipper of all that is female in this world. We loved each other, and shared more memories than I will ever relate. But I think the look he gave that cop is the memory I will cherish most."/>
			<outline text="As usual he was &quot;cocking snooks at authority,&quot; as Aldous Huxley once accused him. But he was doing it, also as usual, with wit. And with love."/>
			<outline text="America managed to forgive Richard Nixon when he died. I hope they will extend the same amnesty to a real hero, Dr. Timothy Leary."/>
			<outline text="Yrs,"/>
			<outline text="John Perry"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="A great TV commercial from one of the life insurance companies. It's brave like Barlow's piece is brave. On the day after you die... The phone will ring. Birds will sing and the sun will shine. It'll rain somewhere. People will make love. Yeah! But your chair will be empty. "/>

			<outline text="Welcome to the software business, where perception isn't what it used to be. Now we're doing perceived perception! Yow. Wow. Oh are they cool? Well, no, they're just perceived to be cool. Hmmm. OK. What's cool? Someone or something that's perceived to be perceived to be cool."/>
			<outline text="How many mirrors do you use? The more the merrier. Or, two is just enough. There's strength in numbers. No one likes to be out there all alone. I will believe anything that is doubly-perceived. Ye-hi!"/>
			<outline text="Whole markets are run this way. Analysts are quoted about what other analysts will think. &quot;Oh I know this is wrong, but the market won't get it, so it's right.&quot; What foolishness!"/>
			<outline text="Why not run industry publications like a daily newspaper? Aren't we responsible for basing our stories on facts, on current information, field reporting, best efforts, instead of just reporting perceptions? Don't editors have a responsibility to find stories that matter instead of reporting on press conferences, alliances and developer's conferences? In the end, do vast proclamations amount to anything? Haven't we learned this lesson often enough?"/>
			<outline text="MacWEEK had a juicy think piece a few months back where someone said that it wasn't just that some product was stagnating, or that it was perceived to be stagnating. The problem (and they quoted him!) is that the perception is that they were perceived to be stagnant. Ay yi yi! "/>
			<outline text="Take a deep breath."/>
			<outline text="We should find a realistic way to keep score in this business, a way of measuring the approximate distance between the pedal and the metal, and leave worries about perception to politicians."/>
			<outline text="***You can't lie to a compiler"/>
			<outline text="In the software business it all comes down to lines of text flowing thru compilers, producing stuff that people can run on their computers. Try lying to a compiler someday. You won't get very far! So a story that's built on lies will have trouble producing software that supports the lies. That's one reason why it's more productive longterm to start hyping a product as it starts shipping instead of before. You'll have to correct yourself less often. It's also less confusing. The perception is that the product really does what you say it does. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, it's perfectly reasonable for this to be a totally hype oriented business because we don't sell anything tangible. That's becoming more and more true. In the old days you filled a box with paper and disks, put shrinkwrap around it and moved it around the world. People felt they were buying something. But the truth is that they were buying a stream of ones and zeros produced by a compiler, processing text written by a geek in a dark room, who, by the way, probably doesn't understand or agree with the hype surrounding the product. "/>
			<outline text="***The Magic Loop"/>
			<outline text="Remember General Magic? Never was there a purer example of this disconnection. Andy Hertzfeld, Magic's lead developer, was quoted on page 1 of the Wall Street Journal calling President Marc Porat a snake oil salesman. (A great one tho!) There was no smiley after the quote. I was wondering at the time, why couldn't we just have the food? Why did it have to come with all this perceived perception?"/>
			<outline text="As an aside, I think it's time to close the loop on General Magic. Porat's great vision is totally bankrupt. Hey it always was, but now it's perceived to be. Magic Cap was usurped by Netscape as the standard interface for the net. And Telescript was usurped by Java. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of lessons here. Probably the biggest one is that the point of having developers is having lots of them! General Magic was very picky about who'd they'd let develop for their platform. They actually bragged about how selective they were. "/>
			<outline text="The exclusive clubs are replaced by the universal ones. In the software world, the YMCA always makes better basketball players than prep schools. HTML becomes the standard instead of Magic Cap. Java instead of Telescript. But how far have we come? And is it far enough? Does anyone know what Java is? I'm still tapping my feet, I'm nervous about this. I think I see some problems and I'm wondering if these things are bothering anyone else. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, General Magic went public and presumably still has a bunch of money in the bank. But they're still flogging the Telescript story. The sooner they give up on it, the sooner they can get on with their real mission, whatever it may turn out to be."/>
			<outline text="***DEC"/>
			<outline text="I read an interview in Upside with Robert Palmer, the CEO of Digital Equipment Corp. Here's a man who doesn't care what you perceive! He inherited a giant company that was about to erase itself because of too much fume-breathing. They were on their way to being the next Wang. They were a precursor to Apple. Palmer steps up to the plate and starts running it like a business. Swallow the bitter pill. Pride counts for nothing. Withdraw from businesses that are dead-ends no matter how painful it is. He clearly had just one shot at turning it around. "/>
			<outline text="Palmer did what his predecessor, Ken Olson, never could. DEC was in denial, they didn't understood how basically the world had changed, and how unprepared for that change the company was. When Palmer stepped in, that's all he could see, how much the vision of the company had departed from reality. He cut off limbs and humbled the company by making an OS deal with Microsoft, trading VMS for Windows NT. There's a ton of irony in that story. But in the end, this is what works in the software business. Sometimes you get a brief lift from reality, when you become the standard bearer, and think you can do no wrong. Then the company goes into denial, lets a new technology generation pass it, and then a no-nonsense business person comes in and tries to extract value from the mess."/>
			<outline text="For me it was a semi-sad piece. I grew up with DEC hardware. The PDP-11 was a gorgeous machine. The VAX was even better. In the interview Palmer talks about how the MicroVax could have been the standard that Intel chips are now. How I wish it had been so! Things would have been so much different. And so much better."/>

			<outline text="If you say Java again, I'm going to ask you what it is!"/>
			<outline text="People think I dis Java. Not true. If you still think so, get a life and stop sending me email. Please!"/>
			<outline text="Last week was Java week. And while everyone except Bill Gates is glad to have a new language and a new operating system, no one has shown software written in Java that wouldn't be easier to do in C or C++."/>
			<outline text="C is a standard language. A C program written for a Macintosh will compile and run on a Windows machine as long as you don't use any special features of either operating system. There is no standard set of cross-platform libraries, but lots of developers have their own libraries that flatten out the differences, with varying degrees of success. "/>
			<outline text="For all practical purposes there are only two operating systems with strategic value; some people would argue that there's only one. Clearly Microsoft is going to have a major say in determining the runtime environment for Java on Windows. There's a lot of debate about what the runtime environment will look like on the Mac. This creates an interesting opportunity, the Mac platform can be an incubator for new ideas, more so than Windows, because Microsoft is not the exclusive leader in this market."/>
			<outline text="Think out about a year. Java isn't just the language of web browsers, it's also a way to develop commerical apps, just like C or C++, but better. Everyone I've talked with in the Java world agrees that this is the way it's going. But these apps will have to compete with apps that aren't written in Java. Actually it'll be even tougher, they'll have to *displace* apps that aren't written in Java. "/>
			<outline text="Will a Java app for a Mac look like a Mac app? If so, Java hasn't gotten us anywhere. Java apps will be slightly more portable than C apps. Depends on the libraries. If a Java app doesn't look like a Mac app, then somehow Mac users are going to have to want something that so far they clearly haven't wanted. (I don't think this is impossible, btw.)"/>
			<outline text="So, which way will it be? Cross-platform or Mac-specific runtimes? Of course the answer is that we'll try it both ways. Someone will do a rich Mac-specific runtime environment for Java. There may be more than one implementation. This is a good thing. Let the market decide the question. No edicts from Apple, please. "/>
			<outline text="Even Sun's Java Runtime acknowledges that there are special features in the Mac OS. As soon as Java connects to the scripting world, the path will have been created, and lots of stuff will happen in Java on a Mac that can't happen on Unix and Windows. So much for an orderly evolution! All hell will break loose."/>
			<outline text="And no doubt there will be an implementation of Java that's totally cross-platform. What will its apps look like? I don't think anyone knows."/>
			<outline text="If you can add any information, please send mail."/>
			<outline text="***Java has an opinion"/>
			<outline text="Java is going to run everywhere. In every API, in every app, in every database, in every client, in every server. You'll write PhotoShop plugins in Java. You'll see CGIs, XCMDs and OSAXs written in Java. OLE, OpenDoc, SOM, even COBOL will come with Java connections. Some of the connections will be gratuitous, adding nothing. We'll get tired of hearing about Java support. Java is going everywhere that C has been. More money is going to be thrown at this new language than was spent in getting a man on the moon."/>
			<outline text="It's a good modern language. They factor out the dead-ends. Their philosophy is &quot;You can't do this! Trust me. You don't want to.&quot; And they're usually right about their assumptions. The limits of the Java language match my coding style, which I evolved after many years of commercial software development. I have very few objections to the calls the designers of Java made."/>
			<outline text="Java has an opinion about the future. Unicode is built in. A clean framework for objects. Threading and resource management are at its core. It makes the right calls, most of the time, favoring code maintainability and correctness over the perceived performance advantages that C allows. It's harder (impossible?) to write dangerous code in Java. "/>
			<outline text="But... APIs designed in Java will only be as good as the designers. It may be nirvana, but it isn't a panacea, and thankfully, the promoters of Java aren't saying that it is. (Who needs another programming language that's perceived to be for non-programmers? -- Thank you!)"/>
			<outline text="The designers know Unix, but clearly don't appreciate the culture of the Macintosh. Being a former Unix geek myself, I like seeing these ideas show up on the Mac done in a way that also works on Unix. Now it's time to take some of the ideas invented in the Mac space, and make them work on Unix. Let's return the favor. It'll be coool."/>
			<outline text="***Of Mice and Menus"/>
			<outline text="It's 1996. There are millions of programmers. They all need something to do. Everyone loves a new language and a fresh start, and a chance to be the Steve Jobs of a new platform. It's going to happen so fast it'll make your head spin!"/>
			<outline text="The world must look mighty strange to Bill Gates. All the pieces Java needs, he already has. And the wierdest thing is, it appears it's going to happen anyway!"/>
			<outline text="This time around we get a chance to see a market evolving a new GUI instead of it coming out of a R&amp;D lab. The Unix culture meets the desktop. Will Sun have a clue how to evolve a new platform? Maybe. How quickly will Microsoft move their source base in front of the flood of new Java system software? Will the Mac community get organized and do something elegant and low-tech in time to make a difference?"/>
			<outline text="There surely will be a subset of Java that's portable, similar to the ANSI libraries for C, but designed around modern computers with larger disks and lots of RAM, fast CPUs, graphic displays, mice and menus and windows. And there will be adaptations of Java that are no more cross-platform than C was. Both approaches will co-exist. Then concepts will port. We'll see Apple Event-like things on Windows and Unix. Java would be a very good vehicle to deliver these capabilities to other platforms. [But we need to ditch the Apple-centered name for this technology.]"/>
			<outline text="Finally, if you dis the Mac, you miss the point. Unix is an even smaller market than the Mac. Java started on Unix. On its path to the mass market it will stop in the Mac market and pick up some new ideas. We have some stuff down that the Unix guys don't factor in. We'll have fun - again!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I have Sun's Java Runtime installed on my Mac. Send me pointers to apps I can run! I'll prepare a web page of pointers. It'll be fun."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Purists will object that C is not implemented the same on all platforms. They'll point to the confusion over the number of bits in an int. Got it!"/>

			<outline text="***The Godfather"/>
			<outline text="I wish DaveNet were a TV show so I could show you a clip from one of my favorite movies, The Godfather, starring Marlon Brando and eighteen other great actors doing their best work. "/>
			<outline text="I'd show the peace conference between Don Corleone and the other Mafia bosses. They've been at war. The Don is recovering from bullet wounds. His oldest son is dead. Another son is in exile. Don Barzini's son is dead. Their businesses are in ruin. It's a sad conference. "/>
			<outline text="Why the war? Why couldn't they get along? Because Don Corleone wouldn't share his senators. The other kingpins wanted to get into a new business, and they needed a feature from DC. He said no, I won't work with you. He had his reasons. But in the end, the war could have been avoided if he had found a way to work with the other Mafia bosses."/>
			<outline text="Another great scene, the opening scene of the movie. The Don is holding court on his daughter's wedding day. A local businessman wants revenge after the police have let him down. "/>
			<outline text="I'll give you money! the businessman says. The Don says -- buono sera (I think this means good day). Buono sera, or get out of my face! If you came in friendship, then on this day when I can refuse no honorable request, your enemies would be mine, and I wouldn't rest until you had your revenge. You offer me money! Offer me friendship instead. Buono sera. Buono sera."/>
			<outline text="If nothing else, The Godfather is about respect. In that way it's just like the Mac business. If you don't respect others, you don't get respect in return. There's no such thing as world domination. None of us get to call the shots. Not even Apple. "/>
			<outline text="Ater all we've been through together, can we finally respect each other for our accomplishments? Can we draw lines, implement APIs and get our products working together in new better ways? I continue to believe that we can. "/>
			<outline text="Can you see me? Can you hear me? Good. "/>
			<outline text="Can we work together? Sure! Will we? We'll see."/>
			<outline text="***MacHack"/>
			<outline text="I'm rehearsing for the MacHack conference. I'll be the keynote speaker when the conference opens at midnight in Ann Arbor on June 22. "/>
			<outline text="They made me an offer I couldn't refuse! "/>
			<outline text="What do I want to say about being a Mac developer in 1996? There's a huge mess at Apple to clean up. That's Amelio's problem. But there's also a huge mess in the developer community. How can we clean that up and get back on track?"/>
			<outline text="And that's where Respect comes into it. Listening to Mac developers, what's clear is how much they want respect. Look at my thing. It's soooo coool! With rare exceptions, none of our peers take note. We are all focused on Apple. Get a deal with Apple. Then come back to MacHack and be a real jerk!"/>
			<outline text="So, at the opening of MacHack I'm going to show a clip from The Godfather. Then I'm going to pick a developer at random from the audience. What do you do? How does your software work? What are you excited about? To everything he or she says, I'm going to say thank you! Thank you for making great software. Thank you for investing in the Mac! Then I'm going to ask if there's anything I can do to make their software work better. I'm going to listen and take notes."/>
			<outline text="Then I'll do it again, until the idea sinks in. I expect it will make people uncomfortable. That's good. "/>
			<outline text="Can we work together? Sure! "/>
			<outline text="Will we? Why not?"/>
			<outline text="***Picky Crabb"/>
			<outline text="Check out Don Crabb's editorial on the MacWEEK website. He calls on Apple to create opportunities for developers. In our market! He fails to mention that Frontier already fills the bill. I think I can hear Crabb's colleague, Henry Norr, saying that Frontier is hard to learn. So what! So is Java. So is JavaScript. So is Visual Basic and so is AppleScript. There's a learning curve in all programming environments. The more it does the more there is to learn. This fact of life can be ameliorated by books and magazine tutorials and websites and mailing lists. But if you ignore us, you cripple the Mac platform, because Crabb's blind spot becomes a self-fullfilling prophecy. "/>
			<outline text="PC Magazine is filled with articles about batch programming, macros, and HTML tutorials. Mac magazines focus on wizzy tools. The website authoring market is more and more defined by raw power for the sysop; it's no wonder that the Mac is perceived to be underpowered. The power is filtered out by the editors of the Mac magazines. The software is there. They just won't write about it. "/>
			<outline text="The need for a MacGeekWeek has never been greater. We get no respect from the Java community when they should be learning from us and stealing our ideas. They are happily ignorant of the power of the Mac. Here's a new opportunity to take the high ground and the Mac world is asleep at the wheel, looking to Apple to cook big meals and delegating developers to make sauces and appetizers. What a mess!"/>
			<outline text="Users trust journalists to base their opinions on facts, not perceptions. The perception is that there is no new power in the Mac world. The perception is that we're all waiting for Apple. Too many perceptions. It's time for the Mac press to get with the program, take a fresh look at the market. "/>
			<outline text="We don't need new stuff from Apple, we need a new attitude from the Mac journalists."/>
			<outline text="***Internet Config"/>
			<outline text="Can we trust Apple? Not yet. They will invade at the slightest provocation, without invitation. They kill our sons without even realizing they're doing it. At least Don Barzini respected Don Corleone. But Apple is like the pezzo novante, the white boy politicians who ran Albany and Washington and Nevada. They don't respect us. They probably don't respect each other either. "/>
			<outline text="Hey, they barely know we exist. All their attention is focused on themselves. Can't blame them for it, it's just the way they are. But if we buy into their premise that developers don't exist, we set up a very unbalanced situation, with no room for happiness. No, we can't trust Apple yet. Maybe soon. But it isn't their time yet. Here's a story that proves the point."/>
			<outline text="Never was there a more needed and more innocuous technology than Internet Config. It handles a dirty chore that every net application used to have to handle for itself -- setting of all the user's net options, and configuring the helper apps while living on the net thru a Macintosh. "/>
			<outline text="It was a struggle to sell this idea to app developers even though it made users lives easier. And system managers. If it were universally supported by Mac net developers, it would lower support costs, and increase usage of the net thru the Mac. A good thing, everyone agreed. But it was trouble to implement support for IC. Regardless, most of the apps swallowed their pride, shared their power for the greater good, respected the users, the managers and most important to me, each other."/>
			<outline text="Well, finally, as of mid-1996, Internet Config is mature. It's reached the point of being the defacto standard in the Mac world, and we know that defacto standards are much stronger than edict-based standards. Along comes Apple. They've discovered the Internet! Let's grow, they say. We'll eat our seed corn. Again! Hmmm. Tasty. All our balls are tossed into the air. With no pride, we Mac developers shuffle our feet, well of course Apple is destroying our market. That's what they do at Apple!"/>
			<outline text="If Gil Amelio wanted to get the audience standing in ovation at WWDC he could have opened with the following: &quot;I've been an Internet user myself for two years. I've been using the apps you developed. One of the reasons it's so nice to use the Internet from a Mac is that I only have to enter my email address once, and every app seems to know where I get my mail. I asked Heidi Roizen how this magic was possible. She told me the developers solved this problem on their own without any help from Apple. I just wanted to thank the Mac development community for doing such excellent work, and I wanted to let you know that Apple will build on Internet Config, and all our Internet efforts will be compatible with it.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Keep dreaming Dave. Nothing like that happened. In a public demo at WWDC, Apple showed their answer to Internet Config. No thanks to the developers and no claim of compatibility with IC. A fresh start! If it ships later this year, they will have caught up to where the development community was in early 1995. The Internet moves at blazing speed. A loop back to 1995 is an amazing concept. And it's totally unacceptable."/>
			<outline text="Developers have to learn to say no to Apple and yes to each other. That's what I will say at MacHack. If I have a choice I will always choose to work with a developer. We're peers. We don't come to the table with an assumption of one of us being inherently greater than the other. "/>
			<outline text="If I can't do a deal with you, I can do a deal with your competitor. If there's a reason for us to work together, a market-driven one, I have no doubts that we eventually will do so. People listen to their competitors even if they don't listen to their friends."/>
			<outline text="Mac developers: send Apple back to the drawing board. Make a clear statement that you support Internet Config, and plan to do so forever. Say no to Apple. This problem didn't need solving. Apple can make the Mac filesystem faster. They can fix their bugs, support our standards, and then get out of our way. They can work with us when they show respect. Until then, we're on our own. That's the message that needs to be delivered loud and clear. Do you hear me? Listen!"/>
			<outline text="***What about the users?"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- the ultimate responsibility belongs to the users, for not learning the lesson, and continuing to move where Apple tells the journalists to tell them to move. Mac users can behave like sheep, at least the more vocal ones. They keep searching for signs of innovation from Apple. There has been *some* movement in system software from Apple, but certainly not enough to justify the faith in Apple that the press and some users have shown. "/>
			<outline text="How come Apple's super-expensive R&amp;D division totally missed the worldwide web? If I were paying the bills I'd want to know why. The time for motion was 1994, not 1996. Luckily Netscape did the moving. Apple was in post-helicar denial. Knowledge navigators? People were ready for a modern Hypercard that lived on the Internet!"/>
			<outline text="The dollars live with the users. When they act independently of Apple and MacWEEK, we have all the grounding we need. So if the users buy into Apple as the center of the universe, they get what they deserve."/>
			<outline text="The truth is that users use the software created by developers and let the journalists focus the attention on Apple. This makes the Mac business very inefficient. It means that Mac-based developers can't raise venture capital money, and can't do IPOs. It makes Apple's R&amp;D budget more and more the sole hope of the Mac community. A self-fulfilling prophecy that eventually will lead to the death of the Mac platform. A diseconomy that Apple could fix in a single press release, but so far hasn't had the courage to deal with."/>
			<outline text="***I will work with Apple"/>
			<outline text="This is a precursor for peace with Apple. We've had some good meetings and exchanged some positive email. But they still don't get it. I'm going to do this in the open. Some developers question whether I want to sell out to Apple. I don't! And I won't. I'm a lightning rod, but some people don't understand what I'm saying."/>
			<outline text="Here are my terms. I'm happy to work with Apple, it's necessary, but as peers, with mutual respect. No more edicts, no more fear and, as I said to Amelio, no more lies. I've looked at AppleScript. It's time for Apple to return the favor. Look at what we've accomplished. Our work promotes their platform. It's time for Apple to acknowledge what we've been doing."/>
			<outline text="More broadly, I want a committment from Apple to tell the truth. If a developer's product defines a market, work with them, support them, and stay out of the way. Tell the journalists and investors to stop looking to Apple for all innovation. Teach them how to look to developers. "/>
			<outline text="Position developers as leaders and we'll attract more leaders. And create new leaders. Develop complementary features in Apple's software. Get down to business, get out of the clouds. Help us turn the corner with the press. And let's help the users find their grounding. Then the platform can grow."/>
			<outline text="I keep doing this because I know that I won. I can't believe how long it's taking for the lightbulb to go off in the rest of the community that they can be winners too. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I wrote this piece yesterday morning, 6/6/96, but decided to wait, to check the assumption that Apple is hosing Internet Config. I sent email to two Apple execs and to three Mac mailing lists. The results are inconclusive. If Apple is embracing Internet Config, it's a positive sign and I will say so in a future DaveNet if it turns out to be true."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Internet Config could grow. How about global search and replace defaults? Or hotlinking across multiple apps, like cmd-2clicking in IDEs and scripting systems. Cmd-2click on something and every running app gets a shot at hotlinking. I wanted to do this in 1992. Four years later it's still a good idea."/>

			<outline text="***Claris has discovered the web."/>
			<outline text="Yeah! I think this is a positive way for Apple to get into the Internet market. "/>
			<outline text="Claris's move onto the web is positive because unlike software that's shipped under the Apple name, Claris products are subject to competition. There's Eudora and Emailer. FileMaker and 4D. Claris Works and Microsoft Works. Diverse needs are served. Engineering teams are motivated to improve their products, to respond instead of dictate. It's a very different attitude and a much easier one to co-exist with."/>
			<outline text="Claris is a mostly-forgotten controversy of many years gone by. It was started with a tradition of excellence, and as far as I'm concerned it has never shipped a lemon. Quite the opposite."/>
			<outline text="So it's interesting that Claris is the acquirer of the Loma Prieta product, a product that claims to have stolen the cursor from Adobe's PageMill. An interesting faceoff has developed."/>
			<outline text="Watch the Claris website for a free public beta of their new page design product, due at the end of the month. PageMill 2.0 is coming soon too."/>
			<outline text="***Two excellent products"/>
			<outline text="Check out TableWorks from Softtools of Quebec CA. It's a really nice HTML table editor. Does this seem like a niche product? Not to me. Tables are central to page design these days. They give you layout features not available from any other HTML tag. You could design a whole authoring environment around the concept of tables and have a winner. That's what TableWorks is! The marketing suits at the big software companies may not get this. But people who do serious web authoring shouldn't miss this one. It's a valuble product."/>
			<outline text="Another great product is WebPainter from Totally Hip Software of Vancouver CA. In its current release it's designed for doing GIF animations, a kind of content that I don't love. Moving GIFs on web pages are almost as distracting as blinking text. They're OK on directory pages, but they have no place on pages that contain text that I'm supposed to be reading. My eye can't stay on the text."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I've been looking for a small memory, simple to use color bitmap editor that's moderately scriptable and uses GIF as its native file format. I need this tool to edit the small bits of color that I put on my low-bandwidth pages, and as a back-end for my CGI scripts. If WebPainter becomes that program, it could easily become the most popular web-based graphics program. It's available now in both Macintosh and Windows versions. I'll be watching this product carefully."/>
			<outline text="***Back to Claris"/>
			<outline text="Developers complained about Claris at first, but the complaints died down when people realized that Apple would control Claris along with other developers, maybe even more so. "/>
			<outline text="A case in point. MacWEEK reports that Apple is ditching PowerTalk in favor of including an Internet-compatible email client in the OS."/>
			<outline text="I have a question for Apple. On the day they ship their emailer, will Claris's product stop working? Or can I stay with what I use now? "/>
			<outline text="I'd like to know now so I can save time and move my email loop over to a Windows machine or a Unix machine. I can't afford any interruption in service. Imagine what life would be like without email. How will Qualcomm and Claris justify continuing to invest in their emailers when Apple is taking over the market?"/>
			<outline text="Believe me, users and developers ask these kinds of questions. When I get them about my product I want to scream so loudly at Apple: stop putting me in this situation!"/>
			<outline text="***A different legal system?"/>
			<outline text="I'm not a lawyer, but I live within the US legal system. I am subject to its laws, so I have to understand them. That makes me careful about what I say and sometimes how I say it."/>
			<outline text="I took a strong position against the US goverment's attempt to censor free speech on the Internet earlier this year. I stayed within the law. I didn't get arrested. I'm glad! And thankful. I remember that I live in a great country because of its tradition of free expression. I think I understand how the free speech system really works, even if our legislators don't. In the end, they didn't arrest me because I disagree with them. I don't even have to be respectful in my disagreement. The legal system protects free speech."/>
			<outline text="What about free speech for software writers? Is it guaranteed? If a platform vendor tells people not to use my product, are they interfering with my right to free speech? How do laws about fair competition apply to software platforms?"/>
			<outline text="I'm confused about my rights. I don't feel fully free to speak thru my software. I am often penalized economically for implementing my view of the future in my software. I see other developers responding to this pressure, not even trying to solve problems that they fully understand and know how to solve. I see a pessimism in the software world that rings of the kind of surrender that I imagine people who live in a totalitarian societies succumb to."/>
			<outline text="In the software business, everyone struggles for government-like power in their own spheres, and sometimes they attain it. How much of this power derives from the ability to control speech and markets? And how well does that serve our interests as thinkers and consumers and citizens?"/>

			<outline text="Platforms are economies and places where people express themselves. The owners of the platforms have enjoyed extraordinary power, beyond that normally allowed to corporations. I'm not asking for regulation or governmental presence in the software industry. On the other hand, the system that we've used hasn't been very effective in guaranteeing the traditional benefits of being part of a free society."/>
			<outline text="So, looping around, I think the economic and free speech issues of the web are inevitably linked to the economic and free speech issues of the software industry. There's an unprecedented wave of growth in the software world again. We've had a taste of totalitarianism. Are we going around the infinite loop again, or this time around, will free speech and entrepreneurship win?"/>
			<outline text="I also think, and have said many times, that the economics are out of whack for the platform vendors too. It's good business for platform vendors to have rules about how they will compete with their developers, and stick to them. I think it's also good for users and developers to be aware of the issues."/>

			<outline text="***Watching my website"/>
			<outline text="My new web act is really coming together now. A quarter-million page reads at www.scripting.com since May 25. No, it probably isn't one of the highest flow sites on the Internet. But it's mine! It's nice. And there are no pictures of naked women to keep the flow up or to outrage the bible-thumpers who demanded censorship and lost."/>
			<outline text="I was just looking at the log. At night, lots of European domains. In the middle of the night the Japanese and Australians visit. And just now I watched a user from Boeing and one from Lockheed learning how to build websites with Frontier. It's looking like the digging is paying off. Ye-hi!"/>
			<outline text="I'm listening to the Stones this morning. Start me up! I've been running hot. I might blow my top. Cooooooooool."/>
			<outline text="***Mac web server performance"/>
			<outline text="We did some benchmarks and found that (no surprise here) that the Macintosh file system is the major bottleneck that limits the overall performance of high flow Mac web servers. It's the reason that some Unix sysops look down their nose at the Macintosh as a web server."/>
			<outline text="As a software guy I know that there's no reason why a Macintosh couldn't equal or exceed the throughput of a Sun or an SGI or a Windows NT box. The PowerPC chip that the Mac is built on is a screamer. I've seen benchmarks that compare the performance of Java applets on various platforms. The only CPU that betters a Macintosh is a high-end Pentium based system. "/>
			<outline text="The Mac CPU is fast. It's the Mac storage system that's slow. We're taking another look at the problem, from a fresh perspective. Hmmmm. Still digging!"/>
			<outline text="***I was interviewed"/>
			<outline text="A few days ago I was interviewed by an online zine. They asked what I want it to say on my gravestone. I thought for a moment. Here's what I came up with. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Not digging anymore.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="That's it!"/>
			<outline text="***Unfettered speech"/>
			<outline text="It was just a coincidence that yesterday I wrote about freedom of speech and software and at the same time the CDA was being declared unconstitutional. "/>
			<outline text="Thanks to my comrade, Todd Lapin, telstar@wired.com, for two quotes from the decision:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from government intrusion.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Right on!"/>
			<outline text="I love those court guys. "/>
			<outline text="They're my kind of people!"/>
			<outline text="***Time for a walk"/>
			<outline text="I took a long walk yesterday to reflect on the court decision. I tried to get back to where I was in February, immersed in the issues of free speech as it related to this new technology that I love so much. Back then, the discussion focused on children, and our hopes for their future. "/>
			<outline text="I was outraged that the censorship advocates used children as their excuse to shut down free speech on the net. I saw it as the most abusive thing my generation could possibly do to the generation that's growing up now. Protect the children from pornography! they said. But the issue wasn't about pornography, it was much broader. Thankfully, the court agreed."/>
			<outline text="I called it a crime against humanity then, and I still do. The attempt to shut down free speech on the net, which is essentially what the net is about, has left a scar on the medium. We reached a limit. All the fear came up. Some good things came out of the experience; now we must move onward, and imagine what the net would have been like if the threat had never been there."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, nuf said, I say. I'll watch how things change now that we're back on the unlimited growth track we were on before this mess was created. If you want to get an idea of what the discussion was about, start reading at &quot;Censorship Bill Passes US Congress&quot; and go forward from there. My favorite piece in the series is &quot;I Promised My Grandfather&quot;."/>
			<outline text="***Free Speech and Software"/>
			<outline text="I started a discussion with my last piece, &quot;Free Speech &amp; Software&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="To those who disagreed with my premise, I ask, are the concepts of free speech and software totally incompatible? Isn't it conceivable, at least in theory, that a platform vendor could have so much power as to limit the freedom of software developers? Isn't it possible that when a platform vendor interferes with a market that at least part of the purpose is to silence a perceived dissonance in the note sounded by the developer?"/>
			<outline text="I'm a wierd cat, I know it. I write prose *and* software. This makes me uniquely tuned into these issues. I don't see much difference between writing a story and writing some software. In one medium my rights are guaranteed."/>
			<outline text="I see it as a continuum. Start with free speech, I say, move to the Internet, then to a web browser, to content tools, then to a computer, the operating system, to PC hardware. There's a chain here, and free speech is essential at every step along the path or you don't have free speech anywhere at all. My opinion. The discussion continues on the &quot;DaveNet Mail&quot; website."/>
			<outline text="***Email by Amelio"/>
			<outline text="I got a gracious email from Gil Amelio, the new chairman of Apple Computer. He sent it a few days ago, but due to an email glitch I didn't get it until this morning. Here's what he said:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;code&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Dave:"/>
			<outline text="I just read your piece on The Godfather. It was very well written. Having written a book myself, I realize what hard work it is. You have my admiration for doing it well."/>
			<outline text="I hope it is not a surprise to you that I agree with much (but not 100%) of what you said in this issue. We've done a lot of stupid things over the years, and, even though I'm trying to address as many of these as I can, the momentum alone will keep us from reversing course as fast as we'd all like."/>
			<outline text="Relationships between companies are similar to relationships between individuals. Between two people, harmonious relations follow only if both people know themselves well. You could call this a definition of maturity. And so it is with corporations. I am trying to take Apple through a process of self-discovery which will result in a more successful and more mature enterprise. At that point (which I hope is not too far into the future), we will develop more mutually rewarding relations with our partners than we enjoy today. It will happen, just not overnight."/>
			<outline text="Despite some advice to the contrary, I feel we can work with you and other developers. To do so successfully will require both parties to come to the table as mature businesspeople with the past put firmly behind us. Heidi, George, I and many others are at this point. I expect the rest of the organization will soon follow our lead."/>
			<outline text="You and many other developers have been incredibly supportive to Apple and I acknowledge your many great contributions to the total user experience. I have been a Mac user for a lot longer than I've been the Apple CEO. To succeed in enhancing this user experience, it is imperative that we work effectively together (both within Apple and with the developer community) or everyone suffers."/>
			<outline text="Only when we have common goals and shared values does one plus one equal three. I'm committed to making Apple, the business, as great as our finest products. We welcome you to join us in this journey."/>
			<outline text="I look forward to many rewarding years working together."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Apple Embraces Internet Config&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/14/96; 2:55:38 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Picky Crabb&quot;, 6/7/96, I reported on confusion surrounding the innocuous and useful Internet Config system put together by the Macintosh net developer community. There was a serious cloud over its head, since Apple demonstrated similar technology at the Worldwide Developer's Conference, and it was unclear if Apple's technology was compatible with the standard that had already been established by the developer community."/>
			<outline text="In a postscript to the piece I said &quot;If Apple is embracing Internet Config, it's a positive sign and I will say so in a future DaveNet if it turns out to be true.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Apple is embracing Internet Config. It's a positive sign! Very coooool."/>
			<outline text="Earlier today I received an email from Alan Samuel, bluker@bing.apple.com; and Arno Gourdol, arno@apple.com. It was the unambiguous statement I was looking for. It's even more important than it may seem on its face, because it represents an acknowledgement by Apple of the work of Macintosh developers, acting independently of Apple. "/>
			<outline text="It's an embrace, not a fud. It's a good thing. A corner is being turned, it's a very positive turn for the Macintosh world, and Apple deserves the support of every Macintosh developer and user for making this turn, and for having the courage to respond to the challenge of a Mac developer. "/>
			<outline text="The cc list on this email is also interesting: garryh@apple.com, heidi@apple.com, tesler@apple.com, amelio.g@apple.com, vito@apple.com, lauta@applelink.apple.com, dash@apple.com, gable@apple.com, mark@apple.com, rimalovs@apple.com, jpalmer@apple.com, lypham@apple.com, auerbach.m@applelink.apple.com, winston@apple.com, vhunt@apple.com. "/>
			<outline text="Some of the names are familiar, some aren't. But it's clear that a connection was created from the top of Apple down to the troop level. Based on past experience listening to Apple people, this kind of connection has been rare in the past. Another positive sign."/>
			<outline text="So here's the message:"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Dave,"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Picky Crabb&quot; you discuss a technology demonstrated at the WWDC, the Internet Config Expert, and raise questions about how this demonstration impacts the developer community."/>
			<outline text="We regret if the demonstration resulted in confusion for you or other developers. That was not our intent. "/>
			<outline text="The demo presented during this session (Session 107, MacOS 8 Assistance and Help Services) showed MacOS 8 Assistance technology working together with Internet Config.  We did call out the fact that Internet Config was a part of this demonstration during the session. Just to be sure that we didn't forget to mention this, we went back and checked the tapes, and it's there. Apparently we were not clear enough for everyone. "/>
			<outline text="We embrace Internet Config. We acknowledge it has been created by a third-party, that it is a good solution for the problem it solves and that many developers are supporting it. We have no intention of &quot;reinventing&quot; a technology that has been invented elsewhere. We apply here the engineering adage &quot;don't fix it if it ain't broke&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="We want to add value for developers and end-users where we can. For developers, it means being able to assume that the Internet Config API is present in the system. We are working toward this. For end users, it means providing an enhanced user experience to configure Internet preferences. We talked with Quinn &quot;The Eskimo!&quot; before starting our work on the Internet Config Expert. Quinn agreed with us that the Expert would add value to Internet Config."/>
			<outline text="The role of an Expert is to present a secondary interface to accomplish high-level objectives, not to replace a primary interface. It seems that Apple and developers share a common goal: make the Mac OS platform successful. I hope we can trust each other to make that happen."/>
			<outline text="We are embracing Internet Config, and we trust you'll let the world know when we do something right as well as letting us know when we do something wrong.  "/>
			<outline text="We hope you'll be able to take this correction into account."/>
			<outline text="Alan Samuel, Arno Gourdol&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Apple Computer Inc."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="The Infinite Loop appears to have broken."/>

		<outline text="Statements about Scripting" created="6/16/1996;  12:00:00 AM" name="statementsAboutScripting" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Statements about Scripting&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/16/96; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***From: Chris Espinosa, cde@apple.com, 6/13/96"/>
			<outline text="Dave:"/>
			<outline text="Here's the message I sent to the [AppleScript mailing list].  I'd appreciate a careful read and thoughtful reply, because I think it represents a genuine effort to change the way we deal with OSA and AppleScript.  Here's it again:"/>
			<outline text="***First Principles for Apple Scripting"/>
			<outline text="General Business Model"/>
			<outline text="1) We are committed to satisfying our customers--to ensure that they have complete solutions for their needs with the expected level of quality and support."/>
			<outline text="2) We are committed to creating business opportunities for developers, so that they can profitably participate in the complete solutions our customers need."/>
			<outline text="3) We are committed to increasing the shareholder value for Apple by creating distinctly superior user value for Apple products.  This is only possible through satisfying customers and creating business opportunities for developers."/>
			<outline text="4) Our business model is to initiate and perpetuate a cycle of innovation: &lt;ul&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;Working with developers, Apple creates an API for a new technology area and clearly defines the technologies we'll develop and distribute. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;Apple seeds users with the technology to do innovative things with it, creating demand for more and better tools and add-ons. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;ISVs sieze the opportunity to satisfy the customer demand and create complete solutions. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;Broader and deeper use of the technology creates customer needs for improvement. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;Apple and developers address the need for improvement by refining the API and base implementation in a compatible and open way, starting the cycle again."/>
			<outline text="&lt;/ul&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Apple derives revenue at four places:  a) in increased value or volume of platforms that use the technology; b) from packaged soutions of Apple and developer products; c) from licensing the technology for use on other platforms; and d) from derivative products and upgrades in later stages of the cycle.  Apple does NOT extract direct revenue from architecture or enabling technologies, or from licensing to developers."/>
			<outline text="***Open Scripting Architecture"/>
			<outline text="5) Apple's chief value in Apple Scripting to build a large, interrelated set of scripting languages, runtimes, development environments, scriptable applications, and scripting additions that give users choice in creating solutions.  Our primary work is to define architecture and standard behaviors, design APIs that reflect them, and build standard products that implement them.  We will avoid &quot;closed&quot; solutions that are focused on Apple technologies."/>
			<outline text="6) We will pursue customer satisfaction as a holistic goal that can only be achieved with a combination of Apple and developer products.  We defer to developers to satisfy needs that are better met there than in Apple offerings.  We avoid gratuitious overlap with developer-supplied functionality. "/>
			<outline text="***AppleScript"/>
			<outline text="7) The AppleScript language and runtime is centered on a human-language syntax and the beginning to intermediate scripter. Our design center is simplicity of syntax and semantics.  As part of the System 7.x distribution, we trade advanced scripting concepts and features for a low disk and memory footprint.  We defer advanced features to other OSA languages or to development environments."/>
			<outline text="8) Customer and developer feedback has directed that the goal of AppleScript 2.0 is to optimize man-machine efficiency, getting tasks done more quickly.  This implies both machine performance and human understandability."/>
			<outline text="9) For AppleScript 2.0 we will select a scope of work achievable with the resources given in a reasonable period of time.  Other tasks will be deferred to ISV opportunities or to a later version of AppleScript.  When we need to bring externally-available capabilities into AppleScript, we'll use a sensible make vs. buy process to optimize time to market, maximize compatability with existing scripts, and give developers a chance to profit from their innovation."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***From: dwiner@well.com, 6/14/96"/>
			<outline text="Chris:"/>
			<outline text="Rather than play phone tag, I'll try to respond to this and see where it gets us. These are just my reactions. I don't claim to understand your intent or goals. I'm going to react according to my interests and hopefully you will take my comments at face value."/>
			<outline text="Overall, I don't see the change. Apple has always attempted to put itself at the center of this market, and your proposal still does this. I don't see it that way. It creates problems, look at menu sharing as an example, a protocol that should have been in OSA, but Apple wouldn't acknowledge it. So it happened anyway without Apple. There are other examples of cases where we have worked with developers to exploit a capability of Frontier that Apple didn't cover or didn't understand. We continue to do this, I hope to have an announcement next week."/>
			<outline text="I object to the Open in OSA for the same reason. It isn't really an open process. If you want to be open about it, we need to be peers, you need to implement our APIs too. "/>
			<outline text="Another criteria, either stop bundling AppleScript or bundle Frontier too. I'd prefer to see you stop bundling AS. With a net distribution system there's no need to bundle. "/>
			<outline text="The term 'AppleScript' has been bastardized so many ways, AppleScripting, AppleScriptable, AppleScripts; you're feeding the process by calling this &quot;First Principles for Apple Scripting&quot;. I suggest coming up with another title. Apple's name shouldn't be all over this, as it has been in the past. We want Microsoft's support. They could have the same objection. Don't repeat this mistake, it's how we got the awful OSA term."/>
			<outline text="Your message doesn't say that Apple will build on our technologies. Many missed opportunities here. As we move forward the deficit gets deeper."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, overall, my major concern with this is that it doesn't reflect the truth. The Mac scripting market is much deeper than Apple and its APIs."/>
			<outline text="I suggest that someone at Apple do an inventory of capabilities that Frontier has to see how you might help promote wider use of those capabilities in the market. That would really be taking the high road, and serving your shareholders in the best way possible by quickly making the Mac platform more competitive. Software development is a tough business. It took many years to create what we have created. It takes much less time to inventory those accomplishments."/>
			<outline text="I've created an initial draft of that inventory on our AppleScript page. http://www.scripting.com/applescript/."/>
			<outline text="The bottom line: I will go for a peer arrangement, I will not go for an Apple-at-the-center arrangement. I have a lot of reasons for this, among them being the desire to return value for my shareholders, and to pay myself a salary. Enough charity work."/>
			<outline text="As a student of various software competition strategies, I believe this one is clearly an implementation of FUD. We can't move forward until Apple says it's time to move. It doesn't reflect reality, we *can* move forward without Apple. I think an Embrace &amp; Extend strategy would be more appropriate here. I wrote about this in May, not sure if you were on the list in that period. "/>
			<outline text="I think it would be a refreshing change if Apple's statement said something like this --"/>
			<outline text="&quot;UserLand has been doing great work in the Mac scripting market. We support their users, everything Apple does will be compatible with UserLand's technologies. We're working with the people at UserLand to push the scripting capabilities of the Macintosh even further and make it accessible to broader audiences.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I would counter that by saying:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Apple has made a major contribution to the Mac scripting market. AppleScript has helped to introduce the concept of system level scripting to many Mac users. The Mac OS is the best platform for Internet content development and web serving, its capabilities go far beyhond that of Unix or Windows. There's been a major change in direction at Apple, and now we're comfortable making a substantial investment in the future of our technology on the Mac platform. We're working with Apple to push the scripting market into the next generation and make it more broadly accessible.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I believe that pair of statements would trigger an investment in this market by our user base (a very influential group of large institutions with lots of money to invest and creative entrepreneurs betting their futures) and would make it possible for us to raise money from the VC community and perhaps even do an IPO."/>
			<outline text="Otherwise we have to dilute our efforts, us fighting you and you fighting us. It may not be worth the effort. I don't want to sit on the sidelines while other people with less developed technologies go public making hundreds of millions of dollars, while I'm camped out waiting for Apple to dominate us."/>
			<outline text="That's how I see it."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/16/96; 10:21:29 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here's an open email to Heidi Roizen, heidi@applelink.apple.com. "/>
			<outline text="We've been emailing privately, but she doesn't know this public email is coming. I feel like the host of a 1960s game show! "/>
			<outline text="Heidi -- please take a deep breath. "/>
			<outline text="We can have fun -- right now!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Dear Heidi:"/>
			<outline text="I said in an earlier DaveNet that this would be an open process. I plan to stick to that. I believe it helps Apple accelerate its cleanup by doing this openly. But more important to me, I accelerate the cleanup of the Mac scripting market. Either way it comes out, with us competing with Apple at the API level, or working with Apple on future APIs, it's better if it shakes out quickly."/>
			<outline text="***Right Answers from Apple"/>
			<outline text="The Internet Config exercise was a warmup. "/>
			<outline text="The loop could have closed more quickly. I sent an email to Larry Tesler, cc'd to you, on June 6, one day before I ran the piece. I got the first response from an Apple person the next day, but it was inconclusive. I gave them the date, time and location of the session I attended. That was all the info they needed. I answered this question several times during the week. I also got flamed a few times by Apple employees."/>
			<outline text="Apple's response was slow and at first impolite. Then it got serious and respectful. I asked to be excluded from the internal discussion. This request was respected. Then the loop closed on June 14 with a definitive and responsive statement. Total time between question and answer: eight days."/>
			<outline text="Internet Config was a hard-fought victory in the Mac market. Apple's ignorance of it was insensitive. Now Apple is publicly committed to IC. Progress! And the cleanup process was accelerated. "/>
			<outline text="As I said previously, I am pleased that the answer was the right one, in the end. I want more right answers from Apple. Let's get the communication system more responsive, and get the disconnection cycles to be shorter or non-existent."/>
			<outline text="***The Tight Little Box"/>
			<outline text="I feel I've reached an impasse in my discussions with Chris Espinosa about the Mac scripting market. I am being straight with him, but I don't think he understands what I'm saying or why I'm saying it. It's much more important that we get financed than I make Chris happy. And by giving him what he's asking for, I would give him the excuse to ignore the features Frontier has that Apple's runtime environment lacks. I don't believe that serves the interests of either of our companies, but it certainly doesn't serve the interests of mine."/>
			<outline text="We have already embraced your technology. The We Love AppleScript page, &lt;http://www.scripting.com/applescript/&gt;, just scratches the surface. It's time for Apple to acknowledge this, and to return the favor, and acknowledge what makes our product so valuble to Macintosh script writers. A full read of the DocServer website and the Frontier website are required to appreciate what Frontier uniquely offers to the Mac scripting market."/>
			<outline text="We do not fit into the tight little box that Apple has specified for developer opportunities. Frontier implements a much broader vision of scripting on the Macintosh. Integrated database, full verb set, scriptable outliner, editable storage system. Easy access to the file system and Mac OS. Multi-threading and synchronization. Object oriented websites! "/>
			<outline text="The language syntax issue is too distracting. Frontier's syntax is actually more mainstream; it's like JavaScript and Java. Same lineage. AppleScript is carrying on the tradition of HyperTalk, a market which, while large, isn't growing as quickly as the Java market."/>
			<outline text="To ignore Frontier's advantages, as Apple has, is to ignore an important set of advantages for the Mac platform. This is market-leading stuff, Heidi, across all platforms."/>
			<outline text="So, I can't support Apple's official ignorance of Frontier and this raises Apple's ire. That's how I read the impasse."/>
			<outline text="The only way I know to get Apple's attention on this subject is to make an issue of it, and refuse to endorse Apple's direction statement until it reflects the reality of what we've already accomplished. I said &quot;no more lies.&quot; That is what I'm invoking."/>
			<outline text="Based on Gil Amelio's email last week, I believe we will work together. But I also believe it could be a difficult process, as Apple shakes off its assumptions about me and my product and my market."/>
			<outline text="***An acid test"/>
			<outline text="I'm working with Chuck Shotton on a major performance improvement in web serving. "/>
			<outline text="Step one is at &lt;http://www.scripting.com/lab/filesystem.html&gt;. "/>
			<outline text="I would like a quick response. What do your technical people have to say? Will you FUD us, or will you be happy that we can squeeze a 5-to-1 performance improvement for high-traffic Mac based websites? "/>
			<outline text="I think this is an acid test of how we might work together in the future. I'm looking for an embrace, of course. Make good on Amelio's pledge to use the developer's solution where it's available. "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, the purpose of this email is to make sure there are no surprises when I write about our plans for the scripting market in DaveNet, and when Chuck and I announce the new web server software we've been working on together."/>
			<outline text="I feel I've done that now!"/>
			<outline text="Still digging..."/>
			<outline text="Dave"/>
			<outline text="PS: People keep comparing Frontier to AppleScript, and I find this frustrating. It's actually a descendent of Framework, a landmark product shipped by Ashton-Tate in the mid-80s. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: To Heidi: Our presentations at MacHack next week offer a great opportunity to tell the Mac developer community how we plan to work together. Chuck is speaking at the WebEdge conference at the same time. It would be cool if the three of us were singing the same song."/>

			<outline text="The Mac OS was designed for individual users, and in that role it performs very well. But the performance of its file system appears to be a major performance limit for high traffic Mac-hosted web servers. I've mentioned this several times in past DaveNet releases."/>
			<outline text="In late May I decided to run some tests to see if this belief was true (it was) and then I started a collaboration with Chuck Shotton, cshotton@biap.com, the developer of the market-leading WebStar web server software, published by Quarterdeck; and Doug Baron, dougb@chilehead.com, my co-developer on Frontier."/>
			<outline text="We're pretty far along, and hope to release the new technology, some from UserLand's source code base, and other parts using new connection technology in WebStar. It will fit in with both our architectures, WebStar's plug-in interface, and Frontier 4.0's website framework. I believe it will up the flow on high traffic sites by as much as a four-to-one ratio. Something to look forward to! I know I'm sticking my neck out, but I think we'll deliver."/>
			<outline text="Since both Chuck and I have invested heavily in the Mac system and its connection to the web, it made sense for us to connect our stuff together more intimately, to make our competitive position relative to other platforms stronger. So that's what we're doing. We have fun playing together, and I think that shows in our work."/>
			<outline text="Over the weekend, I posted the results of a more formal performance test. It shows part of my contribution to the collaboration. I wanted to include the DaveNet readership in this loop. When we have an announcement to make, which should be soon (maybe at MacHack?) having laid this groundwork will help me to explain what we've done."/>

			<outline text="***33 Percent Market Share"/>
			<outline text="I owe Chris Espinosa, cde@apple.com, a hearty thank you for changing my way of viewing the world. At lunch a couple of weeks ago he said that the Mac has 33 percent market share. I looked at him, puzzled, I wanted to know more!"/>
			<outline text="He said that in the world of the Internet, the cross-platform story is the key. I agreed. Java says it's cross-platform. Netscape is cross-platform. Cross-platform is such a key criteria that even Microsoft has renewed their investment in the Macintosh, and is even considering investing in Unix software."/>
			<outline text="If you value your independence of Microsoft, acknowledge the Macintosh. And if you're Microsoft, acknowledge the Macintosh because everyone else does. I find that the inverse is true. I'm looking for parts of my code base that can be ported to Unix and Windows. Once I started looking seriously, without fear, it became clear that large pieces of my technology can be easily ported, and can easily make a difference on other platforms. "/>
			<outline text="It's a three-way world. Some of us specialize in one of the ways, others cut across all the ways. There are advantages to both approaches, and in the evolving ecology of the Internet, specialization *will* matter. People who can deliver the power of a platform and also support cross-platform technology will co-exist. It'll be better if they share their ideas. Of course."/>
			<outline text="The Macintosh user base specializes in content. Windows makes a powerful, inexpensive client. Sysops think of Unix when they think of servers. Sure the markets slosh around, and eventually it isn't that simple anymore (a Mac makes a great server!) but there's room for three platforms, and actual number of users is a very unrefined way to shape a strategy. Client, content and server, those are the three markets. Windows, Macintosh and Unix, those are the platforms."/>
			<outline text="Right now Java owns the cursor. Its cross-platform potential is its biggest selling point, but also is unspecified. Guess where we'll be digging next? Cooool."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/23/96; 11:49:18 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Lee Gets an A"/>
			<outline text="It's Sunday morning. What a great day! So gore-juice. Phthewwwww. Ah ha and yee-hi! The birds are chirping, the sun is shining, the air is cooool. I'm having a nice day!"/>
			<outline text="Eric Clapton is wailing Lay Down Sally. Rest you in my arms. Don't you think you want someone to talk to? Lay down Sally. No need to leave so soon. I've been trying all night long just to talk to you! Love is all that matters. Won't you stay with me? Don't you ever leave!"/>
			<outline text="It's a bouncy song. La la la. Don't sing this song sitting in coach on a crowded cross-continental plane flight. You'd rock too much. Your space would intersect with the space of another person. A stranger! "/>
			<outline text="Ohhh. Plane trips. My Texas-sized body just doesn't fit into those coach seats. My shoulders cram into my neck. My arms bow. Space is invaded. Oy. I look out the window. All that space! Why so little for me? I think from now on I'm going to spring for the bucks and go first class."/>
			<outline text="I got a chance to catch up on my reading. According to Fortune, Lee Iacocca flunked retirement. A riveting story. Three marriages, two divorces. A big mansion in LA. He misses his friends, and he misses his life. He's an old man, but it isn't over yet. He struggles to find meaningful things to do, but he misses having someone to eat with and to lay down with. People have no sympathy for a man as visible and rich as Lee. He's a sad man!"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to hang with Lee, I'd show him what I did when, as a much younger man, I faced the same problem he has now. It's tough being alone. But that's reality. Each of us stands as an individual. The acknowledgement we look for from others can actually only come from within. When we find love, the light is actually shining from within us. It's only an illusion that it's coming from outside. "/>
			<outline text="Even so, we need friends! Not for love, but to share our love. I give to you, and you give back. The loop closes; that's how we know there are other beings. Look at I what I created! Look how wonderful it is."/>
			<outline text="We're a symbolic species. We show what's going on inside by creating things that other humans can see and appreciate. Iacocca gave us the Mustang and minivan.  If you love them, Lee is happy. "/>
			<outline text="But he gave us much more. He's a teacher. He taught us about strength and courage. When Chrysler was in mortal danger, he went on TV, appeared in his own ads, and told us that he was going to bring excellence back to Chrysler. You could see in his eyes that he meant it. He wasn't scared. And by teaching us to believe in him, we felt good, because he taught us to believe in ourselves. He set an example we could all learn from."/>
			<outline text="Happiness is actually that simple. It's about recognition first. And it's about sharing second. That's why a beautiful sunset is beautiful even if you're seeing it by yourself. Share with yourself first, then you're ready to share it with others."/>
			<outline text="Now Iacocca talks about his fear. No longer the invulnerable resurrector. He's found himself, and he's shocked! Believe me I know what it feels like. No more insulation, nothing to protect you from your aloneness. No wife to not give him the love he deserves. No unions to not get the big picture. Nothing interesting to say to reporters. So he hides in his big mansion, afraid to go out because of the recognition he attracts. He's got a famous face! He can't be anonymous. But that's a good thing, not bad. "/>
			<outline text="My advice to Iacocca -- join the world. Use your famous face to help other people. Use the trust people place in you to make the world a better place. Share your creativity with us, and we'll thank you! Stand alone, share yourself with us, and you'll feel good again."/>
			<outline text="Hey -- that's what he's doing! You can't hide on the cover of Fortune. So I disagree with the premise of the article. He didn't fail retirement. He's very successful! He's learning the lessons, and teaching us that it's never too late. As long as you're alive there's more beauty to share and more lessons to learn."/>

			<outline text="***Keynote at MacHack"/>
			<outline text="At 12 midnight on Thursday morning I stood up in front of an audience of 300 leading Mac developers at a hotel in Detroit, Michigan; the town that Lee Iacocca misses. I told them the story of my life as a Mac developer. The short version. Just a few snippets from twelve lesson-filled and productive years. I gave them an example of a person that's centered on himself, that knows what he wants, and has the courage to ask for it."/>
			<outline text="***What I Learned"/>
			<outline text="I learned that there's a major imbalance in the Macintosh community. Many of our most creative software designers aren't centered on themselves. They're centered on Apple."/>
			<outline text="The counterbalance is there. It's always this way. If the developers who survived the repeated shaking of the Mac community look to Apple for recognition, there must be the equivalent need at Apple to *be* the source of recognition. "/>
			<outline text="Like all dysfunction, it's a lie, it goes nowhere. The people who seek recognition can never get it. The people who hold out recognition as the reward can never give it. If either side let go, the cycle would break, freedom would result, and creativity would return. But that evokes everyone's fear. Hold on. The future is unknown! What ever you do, don't let go!"/>
			<outline text="***Where do you want to go?"/>
			<outline text="Imagine you're riding a roller coaster. You're strapped in. There's a security bar. Hold on as the car goes up and then down; makes impossible turns. Your heart leaps out of your chest, but then comes back in place. Hold on for your life! Death is everywhere. Your fear is evoked. Totally!"/>
			<outline text="Imagine you're riding a roller coaster. As the car approaches the top of the first crest, unstrap your seatbelt. Raise the bar. Unclutch your hands. As the car picks up speed your butt raises off the seat. Your eyes bug out. Your cheeks flatten. Your body whips around, from side to side. Up, down, UP, DOWN, again and again. "/>
			<outline text="On the fifth rise your butt doesn't come down. You look down and see the chain of cars, the people recede below you. You can hear your heart beat, you're aware of your breathing. You thought you were going to fall to your death, but instead you're flying and soaring like the birds with huge wingspans I wrote about last summer."/>
			<outline text="Where do you want to go?"/>
			<outline text="***Freedom"/>
			<outline text="Letting go is the only way to get free. And the truth is that we're floating in space, not tethered down. You have always been free. Security is what you look for when you're scared, but security is a total illusion. You think all you need to be truly secure is one more victory. To lose some weight, win a million dollars, get a new wife or husband, whatever, but all this is an illusion. There can be no security for human beings. Sorry!"/>
			<outline text="Lee Iacocca and the Mac community are in the same place. We've been given our walking papers. If it isn't clear now that Apple can't provide us with salvation, what's it going to take? At this point, to look to Apple to sustain us is totally unrealistic. "/>
			<outline text="The man at the top of Apple knows he needs a thriving developer community. But he's at odds with important parts of his organization which are struggling to find ways to again be the arbiter of success in the Mac community."/>
			<outline text="The developer community contains people who are capable of great independent development. People who have already (for the most part) let go of the need to be acknowledged by Apple. I said in my presentation at MacHack that we can be friends, and this is true. But in order to be friends, we have to be strong. We have to learn to say no to Apple, and members of the press have to learn to recognize our power in saying no. We need to say no, so that when we say yes it will mean something."/>
			<outline text="***War Stories"/>
			<outline text="At MacHack we shared our Apple war stories. "/>
			<outline text="Don Brown, the lead developer at CE Software was looking for recognition from Apple in the early nineties. He drafted a beautiful spec for the scripting interface to electronic mail software. Don's product, QuickMail, was the clear market leader when he made his proposal. "/>
			<outline text="Since I was working on scripting software that worked on the other side of this interface, I was in the loop. I remember the email exchanges that went back and forth between Brown and Apple people."/>
			<outline text="They shut him down, turned him off, told him to go away. Apple was going to dominate email. Don's spec was irrelevent."/>
			<outline text="At the time, I asked Don if we could go ahead with his spec anyway, but he said no, he would bow to Apple's wish that he disappear."/>
			<outline text="Now, half a decade later, the loop has closed, and it's clear that a lot of time was wasted. Now there is a standard scripting interface for email, the one implemented by the Eudora mail client from Qualcomm. Anyone entering this market will be Eudora-compatible."/>
			<outline text="We were mistaken, the world did not revolve around Apple, not even the Mac market revolved around them. Don Brown was already floating in space, but he didn't know it at the time. Eventually Apple failed in the mail market. They never filled the vaccuum that could have been filled by CE Software on one side and UserLand Software on the other. "/>
			<outline text="I argued for independence at the time, but I learned that I had to wait; it wasn't time for the Mac development community to let go. I was pretty certain that the day would come eventually. And now it has."/>
			<outline text="***Internet Config"/>
			<outline text="The old Apple would have ignored Internet Config. The standard would have gone the way of Don Brown's email scripting spec. A forgotten opportunity until it was resurrected by some developer, then Apple would kill it (if they noticed!), and on and on, round and round the Infinite Loop. "/>
			<outline text="But this time the loop broke. Instead of erasing IC, Apple took the high road and embraced it. They let go of a very important way of life. Now the developers can ante up on the other side, and create new standards for Apple to embrace. "/>
			<outline text="So, to Don Brown, and all other creative Mac developers: THINK BIG."/>
			<outline text="All is lost. (It was never there.) So why not have fun? "/>
			<outline text="Exactly."/>
			<outline text="***The Go Away People"/>
			<outline text="Knock knock. "/>
			<outline text="Who's there? A Mac developer. What do you want? Let's have fun! "/>
			<outline text="Go away!!"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- the Go Away People are still running the show at One Infinite Loop. Boy are they holding on. Like the gatekeeper in the land of Oz, all they want from us is for us to go away. Sorry!"/>
			<outline text="Some at Apple have let go, including the top guy, Gil Amelio. Let's call them the Go Ahead People. Good fences make good friends, they say. I like that! Once the fences are up we'll be free to play. And if it gets rough so what? Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I think Arnold Schwarzanegger said that. Or maybe Don Corleone? I don't remember."/>
			<outline text="But Don Crabb, a MacWEEK columnist, says Apple should cook great meals and let developers serve the appetizers. No way Don Crabb. Apple could be a stove. A hot fast file system and net connection and a clean low-tech process manager. The user interface stays constant. No one likes a stove that moves around too much. They tend to explode. Simmer for a while, then turn up the heat, get it right, and then don't mess with it. We'll cook the meals. Tasty stuff! And filling. "/>
			<outline text="Crabb's colleague, Henry Norr, says we have to accept that Apple will pick at our meals and then kick out the cook. A totally vestigial attitude. He's referring back to the system that created the disaster we're digging out of now. Henry, everything in the Mac space must be subject to competition. No more edicts. No one with the power to say Go Away. Even Apple is disclaiming that responsibility. No one is smart enough to say what the market deserves. "/>
			<outline text="The system Norr calls for reminds me of Soviet communism. Planned economies with bureaucrats calling the shots. What a ridiculous prescription for the most dynamic industry of the late 20th century. We tried that approach and it didn't work. You can't hire people to do what independent developers do. All you get is wasted shareholder value, PowerBooks that explode, and dead developers."/>
			<outline text="But you can see the lightbulb turning on elsewhere at MacWEEK. The main editorial in this week's issue points to the competitive market for web content tools on the Macintosh, and repeats a claim I've made in DaveNet many times: we're leading all platforms in web content tools and technology. It seems every week there's a new wizzy HTML tool, a GIF editor, a table editor. They will eventually all work together; some already do. We have a thread that connects BBEdit and Eudora to Netscape, MSIE and WebStar, and thru Fetch and Anarchie to servers running on Unix and Windows and other Macs. We'll keep repeating the message. Market share isn't our Internet strategy. Feeding content creators the tools they need is our business, it's where the growth of our platform comes from. We'll show them how to build dynamic, full-featured web presences. How to capture their readers' interest and hold it. We have a bright future, one that Norr and other Go Away advocates don't understand."/>
			<outline text="The most effective web content comes from Mac users, and the developers are responding to the challenge. When we look back a year from now it will be clear that nirvana happened on the Mac platform. We're there, we just need a few more pipes and more important, we need to recognize each other and work with each other. "/>
			<outline text="Some developers say it's time for Apple to grow up. How true. But it's also time for Mac developers to grow up. "/>
			<outline text="Let's work together. We can be friends. It'll be fun. You'll see!"/>
			<outline text="http://www.macweek.com/mw_1025/opinion_editorial.html"/>
			<outline text="***Trust"/>
			<outline text="To trust, you have to believe that the universe is a user-friendly place. It's a choice, the difference between being a positive person and a negative one. The truth is that I don't know the true nature of the universe. So if I don't know, why not choose to believe it is a good universe? Exactly."/>
			<outline text="It's OK for people to have different opinions and values. I don't have to convince everyone that I'm right. That makes it possible for me to relax and say what I have to say. If you disagree, that's totally OK. We compete and maybe we learn from each other. Free expression. That's what makes the world go round, and that's what makes the universe such a nice place to live in. There's so much space between the planets. We can all exist and have fun."/>
			<outline text="I don't hold on to you, but I touch you if you're open to it. Like Iacocca's Mustang and minivan, I make things I like and hope to make contact with other people who like them. "/>
			<outline text="It's about symbols, but our ultimate act of creativity is ourselves. No one makes us one way or another. The illusion that they do is the excuse we provide ourselves to succumb to our fears and avoid living. So Apple doesn't put me out of business, I do. No point laying blame. Just go where the fun is. That's my new formula."/>
			<outline text="It's fascinating to see Apple struggle with this. Can they trust the developer community to deliver new markets to the platform? They have no choice. What's next? No one knows. Will Microsoft reduce Netscape to irrelevence? No one knows. Will the Macintosh market grow again? No way to tell. Can we do it alone? No. We have to trust each other because we have no choice."/>
			<outline text="***Two philosophies"/>
			<outline text="A clear choice."/>
			<outline text="The Go Away People versus the Go Ahead People. "/>
			<outline text="I know which is the winning strategy. "/>
			<outline text="If you've been paying attention you do too."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I liked doing the MacHack keynote so much I scheduled another one for Sunday July 14 at the San Jose Convention Center, 7PM. DaveNet goes live, one more time! It's free, part of the Mactivity web conference. You bet we'll have fun!"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/27/96; 5:51:28 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good evening! A rare occurrence. A nighttime DaveNet. Yeah. I think this is only the second time. "/>
			<outline text="Tonight we have a guest speaker, Mr. Marc Canter, founder of Macromedia, a leading animation tools company based in San Francisco. He's been doing content for the last few years and is now launching a new venture to do multimedia venues."/>
			<outline text="So I'll turn the stage over to Marc, and add some comments of my own at the end."/>
			<outline text="***The Multimedia Industry: RIP&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="By Marc Canter, marc@mediaband.com"/>
			<outline text="I think it can easily be said that the multimedia industry is dead. No longer do analysts predict the yearly growth of sales or title development. No longer do you find the starry eyed entrepreneurs pitching business ideas to hungry venture capitalists."/>
			<outline text="Needless to say all that action has moved onto the Internet. It stopped off at 3D and wireless handheld devices along the way, and I'm sure the action will find somewhere else to go after the Internet. Perhaps it'll be Agents or Interactive TV."/>
			<outline text="The point is that multimedia was never really an industry. It was a level of personal computing that included all media types, and which enabled developers to create true multimedia information. "/>
			<outline text="Now we're at a new brink of technology. But we're once again talking about a new industry and era as if we didn't learn any lessons from the last set of promises. Multimedia was never a marketplace just like the Internet is not a marketplace. "/>
			<outline text="New technology breakthoughs are added to the list of technology we have at out disposal and the agregate amount of cool stuff just goes up. "/>
			<outline text="Do you remember back when all we had was amber or green text on a black background?  When sound or video was the farthest thing from IBM and the business market's mindset?  "/>
			<outline text="Well that's sort of the way I feel about the Internet today. The bandwidth is so limited and access times so long that it's impossible to demonstrate the potential of hypermedia. "/>
			<outline text="I can't tell you how many times we simulated the future with Director. I'd point at a blue underlined word, in some simulated newspaper of the future and I'd say &quot;In the future you'll be able to click on a word and have it jump to a definition of what that word means.&quot;  That was all back in 1988 and 1989."/>
			<outline text="Now seven years later we finally can click on a word and have your page switch to a definition of that word. But it's only hypertext. We're all still waiting for true hypermedia. I want to be able to click on a word and have it jump to the middle of Citizen Kane or read a column while listening to Aretha Franklin."/>
			<outline text="That's' where we're heading and I don't care if you call it the Internet, Interactive TV, cable modem or broadband distributed multimedia. The fact is that no one technology or trend is going to make up the future and in fact nothing's mutually exclusive."/>
			<outline text="We all still listen to radio and use a telephone. And I for one certainly still carry around a pen and paper for jotting down notes or ideas. "/>
			<outline text="So why are we constantly jumping from one fad to the next, from one earth shattering trend and the next development platform?"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Good question! The advance of technology, underneath the hype, *is* a continuum. A few years ago it was clear that at some point all desktop computers would be connected together thru a global network. But an explosion was needed to shake the industry out of low gear and start it barreling down the mountain as it is now."/>
			<outline text="A couple of years ago we were trying to figure out how to use ISDN bandwidth. Now its becoming commonplace. I understand that you want more, but I'm a text and database guy, not a pixels and audio bits guy, so I'm happier with lower bandwidth. But I understand what makes you tick and I understand why you're frustrated."/>
			<outline text="But, if there had been no Internet euphoria, Compuserve, AOL and possibly Microsoft would be leading the online business. There would be less opportunity for individual independent developers to make a contribution. We'd have to deal with the generation of twenty-somethings, not as entrepreneurs, but as middle-level managers inside huge corporate structures. Been there. Done that. And I didn't like it! (Neither did you.)"/>
			<outline text="But I agree with you Marc. We should always be looking to break thru the bottlenecks. If the Internet has taught us anything, it's that just when things appear to be most stagnant, it's actually the best time to invest. The deeper the rut, the more explosive the growth will be. "/>
			<outline text="In a couple of years, if you're following the pack, break away and take a chance. If something appears intuitively obvious to you, but everyone else doesn't get it, invest!"/>
			<outline text="I've learned that lesson too many times!"/>

			<outline text="I say to an Apple person: &quot;Microsoft is doing a great web browser.&quot; Apple person says: &quot;Office is really great. We want Visual Basic.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hello!"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is making excellent Mac software."/>
			<outline text="Did you hear that? I'll say it again."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is making excellent Mac software. I'm not talking about Office. Honestly, I find Office boring. I find Internet apps exciting."/>
			<outline text="One more time."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft Internet Explorer is a very nice piece of software. "/>
			<outline text="Let's really nail it. "/>
			<outline text="Explorer is the answer to the warmed up leftovers that Netscape has been offering to Mac users. "/>
			<outline text="***Oh Netscape!"/>
			<outline text="Oh Netscape! They say they saved the Mac. That's true. They say they do everything on the Mac they do on Windows. Yes, but later. Will they work with us to make Navigator fit into the new stuff that's originating on the Mac? No. Not really. "/>
			<outline text="So, in my view, Netscape is no longer a friend of the Mac platform, because if net standards can't originate from this community, we don't have a prayer for relevence. We'll be running ported Windows apps and parts forever, and that doesn't leave much opportunity for growth in the Mac developer world. It's actually a formula for our starvation."/>
			<outline text="Andreessen says nice things about the Mac, but they half-implement stuff, leave the bugs in, so we can't build on the features. "/>
			<outline text="They proclaim their love for Apple and ignore the disconnection between Apple and the Mac community. "/>
			<outline text="How quickly Netscape transformed from an outsider to a part of the power structure that tries to keep things from happening. Do they really intend to use OpenDoc as their integration strategy? No of course not. But on stage they leave that impression. That's bad. It's dishonest! My values, of course."/>
			<outline text="***Enter Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="Enter Microsoft with a different approach. First, they gain credibility in the user base and among developers by quietly shipping an excellent Mac-only web browser. They use native Mac development tools. Build on our scripting languages. Support our APIs. We didn't have to sell them on it, we didn't even know they were doing it! Instead of creating a buzz, they implement it. It's respectable behavior. It shows depth and patience, and an understanding of how power flows in this community."/>
			<outline text="They start showing up in public. They know our names. They know what we do. They implement our suggestions. They offer to share what they have. They want to work with us, just like the people who make WebStar, Eudora, Stuffit, Filemaker, Anarchie, BBEdit, and Internet Config work with us."/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm. The answer was yes, of course. "/>

			<outline text="So, if Microsoft is making the right sounds, I want Netscape to listen and learn and grow to appreciate the relationships they can build with other Mac developers. To follow Microsoft's lead, but to develop a unique Mac presence, to add their own Netscape twists to the formula. It may be against their religion to do so, but their religion will change when Microsoft's power in this market becomes visible."/>
			<outline text="Both Apple and Netscape are blind to this right now. They don't have a clue what's going on in the Mac net space. Sooner or later it's going to occur to them. Until that time, Microsoft will take advantage of the vaccuum as only Microsoft can. "/>
			<outline text="When Netscape and Apple wake up it'll be because they'll see a small mountain of interconnected software developed by a dozen or so Mac developers, with Microsoft at the center. And new cross-platform standards, supported by Microsoft, that were quietly brewing in the Mac community."/>
			<outline text="The bottom line: Microsoft sent a listener and contributor into the Mac community. The others didn't."/>
			<outline text="***Apple's fear"/>
			<outline text="I want to walk on two legs because Microsoft is like all huge corporations, they prefer to dominate, but first they must compete. We're all served better if they're forever in the compete stage and never achieve dominance. I think this is actually better for Microsoft too, but it isn't my job to worry about what's good for Microsoft; I come first, of course."/>
			<outline text="As I've been talking with my new friends at Microsoft and my old friends in the Mac net community I've been trying to get a feel for how it will play out. Suppose we give Microsoft what they want? How can we be sure that they will continue to respect us once our software is delivered? Will they be open to new generations of standards coming out of the Mac net community, or is this a one-time deal?"/>
			<outline text="I think I have the solution, but it requires both Apple and Microsoft to accept each other, and to allow the Mac developer community to play its natural role in driving new markets, and to assure that Microsoft's role in this market is no greater than the software and the upgrades they deliver. And the same with Apple."/>
			<outline text="Publicly and privately, the Microsoft spin is that they try to work with Apple, but Apple always blows them off. Apple says you can't trust Microsoft. This animosity serves neither company. The rules of the software industry have changed. Both Microsoft and Apple are struggling to retain relevence. They have the same problem. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has realized that it makes sense to be serious about the Mac. I want Apple to stand up and acknowledge Microsoft's investment, and define the (crucial) role of Internet Explorer in the Mac net world. It's an interesting story. It supports Apple. It's time for Apple to tell the story instead of ignoring it."/>
			<outline text="Why? Because ignoring Microsoft is a disastrous strategy for Apple. It's the equivalent of Apple's ignorance of Windows 3.0 in 1990. It's probably going to do more damage to Apple than the earlier ignorance did."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, Microsoft must be willing to let independent software remain independent. Owning the standards isn't cool. Working cooperatively to create new standards is the best way to go, for all of us. I understand that this is now part of Microsoft's religion. The actions must agree with the positioning. "/>
			<outline text="To Microsoft: we're going to play with all our toys, and we're going to make new ones. If it shows the Mac to be more competitive than Windows in some areas, so be it. If we let each platform find its own role to play, we won't need to struggle. The truth is that Windows does not equal Mac, and vice versa. Different people, different uses, different strengths. We'll port our standards to Windows. Welcome those standards as you want Apple to welcome you to the Mac world."/>
			<outline text="It's good that Microsoft has stopped looking to Apple to run the Mac market. There was a time when this was so. But now, if we invite Apple to play a responsible role in the Internet apps market, a role which I think they are capable of, I am looking to Microsoft to let it happen, and more important, to be part of it."/>
			<outline text="And, to Apple, I would like to help Microsoft deliver great new technology to the Mac platform that works incredibly well with software created by other Mac developers and delivers new exciting reasons for people to use a Macintosh. How do you feel about this?"/>
			<outline text="***Apple's power"/>
			<outline text="Apple doesn't trust Microsoft. I think it's correct for Apple to not trust a dominant Microsoft, but they can carefully use their power in the Mac market to assure that Microsoft doesn't dominate. Skillfully expressed, Apple's power is as great as Netscape's."/>
			<outline text="Do they have to worry about Microsoft's dominance? I don't think so. There are two powerful counterbalances: Netscape Navigator and the Mac development community. Apple doesn't need to do anything to stimulate Netscape, Microsoft will take care of that. "/>
			<outline text="What Apple can do is help to reduce the vulnerability of the Mac developer community. We're thick on technology and thin on cash. The standards of this community can be purchased for pennies. "/>
			<outline text="There's a ton of value in the Mac net apps market, expressed in source code that works and brilliant people who choose to make Mac net apps. Here's the perfect opportunity for Apple to kick back for the next couple of years, heal its wounds and let developers drive the market. Microsoft appears to be ready to be part of the community. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft and Netscape facing off in the Mac market can stimulate growth and investment in our world. This is a very good thing for Mac developers and for Apple shareholders. The faceoff should be encouraged by Apple. It's total win for the Mac platform. A paradigm shift may be necessary at Apple, but I believe they're capable of it."/>
			<outline text="There are new pieces to be created that this market needs. We're creating them, building on stuff we already have working, and making new connections. Java plays a key role in all that we do. New content tools and new server architectures. A relevence for the platform that keys off its strengths. No parity, where parity makes no sense. We'll work with other Mac developers to strengthen the platform and to promote new net standards. We'll port the key components to Windows and Unix. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has stepped up and offered to be part of the process. We say yes. Apple can say yes too."/>

			<outline text="***Apology and Retraction re Netscape"/>
			<outline text="I stepped over a line in the last piece, &quot;Microsoft in the Mac Market&quot;, and wish to retract my statement about Marc Andreessen's honesty. It wasn't fair. I apologize to Marc and the people at Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="I don't like the fact that Netscape has aligned itself with Apple's Cyberdog-at-the-center vision of the Mac web client world. But let's assume Andreessen knows what he's doing and is being straight with us. "/>
			<outline text="I don't like it when people question my honesty, and I like it even less when I do it! Sorry Marc and thanks for taking the high road."/>
			<outline text="And many good things came from that piece. I got a call from a project leader at Netscape, and an invitation to have lunch with their Mac team to talk about how Netscape can connect up to other Mac-based net clients and servers and content tools. I returned the call, of course. I'll report on progress in a future DaveNet. Thank you Netscape."/>
			<outline text="***Negative Energy at Apple"/>
			<outline text="A rumor is running around Apple that I want them to cancel AppleScript and replace it with Frontier. Not true! I wish they'd check with me first. "/>
			<outline text="I haven't even offered to license Frontier to Apple. The question has come up and I've asked to wait a couple of months to discuss this. I want to wait until management changes settle at Apple before discussing something as important to me as the licensing terms for Frontier. I also have some more technology I want to deliver before locking things down."/>
			<outline text="No one likes to be painted as a villain, or have their opinions misrepresented, me included. Maybe Apple should cancel AppleScript? I don't know. I probably wouldn't like it because people would look to me to fill its bill. I'm not ready to do that. "/>
			<outline text="AppleScript serves the needs of many people who are casual about scripting. I prefer to work with people who are passionate about scripting. AppleScript is a useful filter. I want to connect with people who have a real business reason to set up automatic processes, especially people who are doing web content. So I like the way things are now. No need to change anything. I hope that clears it up."/>
			<outline text="I'm still interested in authoring tools for writers and graphics people. I have lots of experience in this area, check out MORE, a product I did in the mid eighties. It's a very interesting tool for building object oriented websites! It was a little ahead of its time. Actually a lot."/>
			<outline text="And to Apple, more professionalism is called for, please! This rumor has been spread widely, but no one bothered to check with me. Hopefully Apple management will make it known within the company that a developer's reputation is not something to be treated casually. How about a little benefit of the doubt? "/>

			<outline text="***Web Energy at Apple"/>
			<outline text="I like it. Hey -- I had a meeting on Wednesday with 24 Apple webmasters and sysops. Yes, they have good web energy at Apple. I knew it. I respect those gals and guys."/>
			<outline text="The meeting started with a demo of Claris's Home Page. Nice product! What a great combo Home Page would be with Frontier. Their clip art gallery is the perfect user interface for macros and smart web elements. As soon as they're ready we'll get this working. It'll be very cooool."/>
			<outline text="Then I showed them Frontier's templates, macros, the glossary, object oriented websites, connections to standard apps. They loved it! I was so happy. Still am!"/>
			<outline text="Hey - even in a company that has its share of negative energy, the web people at Apple are like web people everywhere. Open minds. It's the nicest thing about the web. It attracts clean-energy people who respect the work that other people do. I can spot a web person anywhere. A smile. They stand up tall. They respect good work. Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="Breathe deep, take it all, it comes cheap. Wheeeee! Suck it up suck it up suck it up fill it up."/>
			<outline text="***The nature of the web"/>
			<outline text="We're still learning more about the web. It's not a wizzy medium like page layout was. It's the opposite of wizzy, instead of What You See Is What You Get, it's actually You Have No Control Over What They'll See."/>
			<outline text="So wizzy editors come up short. It doesn't matter what you see on your screen. It probably has nothing to do with what the reader sees. "/>
			<outline text="That divides the market into two parts, products like PageMill, Home Page,  Front Page et al, that try to give you a fully wizzy editing environment, and products like BBEdit and other text editors that give you great text editing tools like multi-file search and replace (with grep!) and connections to scripting software and databases."/>
			<outline text="I've believed in the non-wizzy nature of the web for some time, and built my software accordingly. I experimented with easy to use website builders, and found that I always wanted to customize and control and flow things in ways that aren't supported in wizzy environments. "/>
			<outline text="Eventually I gravitated to BBEdit, because it's powerful and because its author Rich Siegel, siegel@barebones.com, is a friendly guy who likes to put features into his product to connect with products like mine. So personality is an issue. The wizzy guys try to do it all themselves. Eventually they will realize (I think) that they can hook into web flow systems, and that this will truly make it easy for the writers who develop web material and the sysops that support them."/>
			<outline text="MacWEEK has an excellent piece on this subject in this week's issue. Everyone who's involved in web development, on any platform, should read this piece. It's a milestone. I believe they got it totally right. Yay! "/>

			<outline text="***Who does Microsoft fear?"/>
			<outline text="I've been meeting with venture capitalists. It's fun! I don't wear a suit, but this is Silicon Valley. Yeah, I just wear my jeans and a black jacket and a white shirt and soft brown shoes. I carry a PowerBook and bring a printed business plan. I tell my story. I listen, and sometimes I hear an interesting story. Here's one."/>
			<outline text="The VC asks who does Microsoft really fear? Name two companies. It's a puzzle with an interesting punchline. Think about it."/>
			<outline text="Netscape? No. They think Microsoft thinks that eventually they'll wear them down. It's just a matter of time before the Microsoft browser is truly ubiquitous, and then content developers will be compelled to support the stuff that Microsoft has put in their path. I think it's a little more complex than this, but I went along."/>
			<outline text="Apple? Well, of course not. They read the papers at Microsoft. The battle with Apple happened in the early 90s. It's over. No fear of Apple at Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="OK. Answer number one. Intel. Microsoft can't afford to let Intel out of its sights. They can't compete with them. There are no challengers in sight, and conventional wisdom is that no one can catch Intel. It costs too much money to set up a manufacturing operation like the one Intel has. Even the US government couldn't catch up with Intel."/>
			<outline text="But here's the surprise. The other company that Microsoft should fear is Cisco Systems. Cisco? Really? You drink too much!"/>
			<outline text="It's a puzzle. I'll explain it in the next piece. In the meantime think about it. Interesting stuff! Guesses are welcome."/>
			<outline text="***Hancock"/>
			<outline text="Apple announced on Tuesday that Ellen Hancock is the new top development person at Apple. She starts on Monday. We've had a lot of time to think about Ms. Hancock in this position, since she was rumored to be Amelio's choice for a couple of months."/>
			<outline text="The New York Times report was an interesting case study in how the world doesn't appreciate what's right and wrong about Apple. They decry the loss of innovation at Apple. It's true, the whole original Mac team is gone now. But they've been gone for many years. The energy that created the Mac was dispersed in the mid eighties. When people look to Apple to provide the spark of creativity, they point our attention at the wrong place."/>
			<outline text="Turn your heads 180 degrees. Today's developers have much more in common with the original Apple, the one that produced MacWrite and MacPaint, than today's Apple does. Look on your hard disk. Where did your net apps come from? Content tools? Servers? Hmmm. It wasn't Apple."/>
			<outline text="Hey - they've been hiring out of the general talent pool of Silicon Valley for twenty years. They've been operating as a conventional corporation and professorial R&amp;D house for many years. No entrepreneurial incentives. They've been focused inward for many years. To expect them to wake up and invent a new paradigm that's relevent is as unrealistic as thinking that OS/2 was going to displace MS-DOS in the late eighties."/>
			<outline text="So Ellen Hancock, the ex-IBM executive, seems to be exactly the right kind of person to lead Apple's development. She says that she can wear jeans too. But... Hmmm! That's not the right answer. We need more suits at Apple. People with sharp pencils who ask Why? or Who wants this? People who can teach Apple to be responsible and accountable. More than anything, Apple needs to grow up and to lower the volume. Great breakthroughs can't come from Apple. Stop dreaming. "/>
			<outline text="Apple's challenge is to make the trains run on time and get out of the way where ever possible. To make a profit at whatever level makes sense, and to allow developers to take risks and drive and serve the new markets that are growing so quickly. Then Apple's profits will come back, and their price-to-earnings ratio will soar to net-stocks level. "/>
			<outline text="Apple people who want to spark new markets with great ideas should start new companies, write business plans, raise venture capital, and compete in the market. Apple itself can't afford to take the creative and technological risks. The economics vastly favor small independent developers. "/>
			<outline text="They're inches away from the right answer now. John Markoff at the Times seems to be yearning for something he can't have. He remembers too much. Let's set realistic expectations for Apple. If you really want an alternative to Windows it's the only way to go. "/>

			<outline text="If you're interested in the Internet (duh!) and Microsoft (they're interesting) check out this week's Business Week cover story written by Kathy Rebello, katreb@aol.com. Rebello details the transformation of Microsoft from a PC software company into an Internet software and content company. According to the story the big transformation happened at the beginning of 1996."/>
			<outline text="I have two comments. They still have to make the transition. My stake in the ground: the day every Microsoft employee has their own web page, accessible to the public, with pointers to all the people they work with, inside and outside of Microsoft, that's the day when Microsoft will be fully committed to the net. The nature of the net is cooperative work, and connections between people that cross company lines. It's not in Microsoft's nature to be so out of control. But to be truly big in the net your presence has to be felt on an individual level. Then your tools will be truly relevent, and your people won't miss the rapid change, that really hasn't begun yet."/>
			<outline text="Every year, we think it can't get bigger. But you ain't seen nothing yet. The world is still pretty much as the world was. When this is finished you won't recognize the world. Sure trees and flowers will still be great. We'll need them! because our understanding of people is going to be totally revolutionized. We're in for quite a ride. I'm just seeing that now."/>
			<outline text="Second comment. I get an I Told You So. I was writing about this stuff in 1994, while Microsoft was still battling to get Windows 95 out and battling the Justice Department and placing their big bet on Microsoft Network. Check out the early DaveNets, especially &quot;Bill Gates vs The Internet&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="***Cisco Systems"/>
			<outline text="In the last piece I asked which two companies should Microsoft most fear? I even answered the question. The first one was Intel. The second is Cisco Systems. I found this surprising, but Ian Bell, ian@sutton.com, a webmaster from Vancouver, didn't. Here's what he said:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;It's not surprising at all. The two companies are like Amtraks on a collision course. Why?  Simple. Cisco makes software for networking, and wants to make tools for content. Microsoft makes tools for content and wants to make software for networking."/>
			<outline text="&quot;When you buy Cisco you get a black (or blue) box. Take it apart and have a peek inside: standard components. Go down to Fry's (I can't, I live in Vancouver) or Merisel and you can buy PC parts and basically build your own Cisco box in your garage. The key is the software. Cisco makes bullet-proof software for telling packets where to go and how to get there. Increasingly though, they're moving into telling computers what kinds of packets to serve and how. They are a software vendor. The hardware platform is moving towards them. The web is the next step."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Windows NT wants to become a ubiquitous solution for being an ISP; a content vendor; etc. At the same time they're really keen on moving towards routing and switching and subnetting because they have to in order to be a complete solution. The Normandy project is all about this. Microsoft thinks they're competing with Sun, but soon they won't be."/>
			<outline text="&quot;I look in my rack and there's an NT server, on top of which is a Cisco 2514, on top of which is a 4700 with a bunch of ISDN BRI ports and 100BaseT. All of that hardware is the same stuff, but the core OS on the Cisco product is not DOS. What happens when Cisco wakes up tomorrow (perhaps they have) and realizes that the reason their product is so expensive is all the hardware they have to buy and build and support. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;You sell one router and it costs you $400 to make. You sell 100 routers and it still costs you 400 bucks per unit. With software, economies of scale means you can spread the cost over thousands of sales. Eventually, $2700 retail worth of software cost you $7 you make. Use somebody else's hardware! What better than the Intel platform? NT and Novell have done them a favour by putting Intel PCs at the centre of LANs worldwide."/>
			<outline text="&quot;I heard Cisco has black boxes that serve web content. It's clear to me they're working on the software. Cisco-labelled routers are the testbed, not the solution. They're poised to move the hardware out from under NT just as NT is maturing, and they have the power to do it because they have the brainspace and the trust of network managers; and because they make awesome software, and even more awesome amounts of money."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Microsoft will has an advantage, though, in content. As an avid Mac and NT webmaster, I know that the key to these platforms is not the server software itself, but the software that runs on the machine that complements the server software and adds value to its content. Cisco has a lot to replicate if they're going to try to maneuver in this marketplace -- especially now that server-side ActiveX controls have so much promise."/>
			<outline text="&quot;I'm not crazy but I do drink too much. Cisco is driving lots of low-level technologies through the IETF right now in an attempt to retain control of routing, moving toward IP v2.0. Compare the number of RFCs submitted by Cisco to those submitted by Microsoft and it's pretty clear who's Amtrak is going faster.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Ian. You are so right. A clue can be found on their website. They have a dynamic page that lists all their recent acquisitions. They're moving fast. And some of the stuff they've been acquiring includes the server and content software you talk about. "/>

			<outline text="***A Sad Note, for Me"/>
			<outline text="Friendship is a great thing, I don't know how to live without it, nor do I want to try. A few months ago I said something very real to my friend Bernie Dekoven. I said, Bernie we're getting into best friends territory here. Someone had tried to enter my space thru Bernie, when the appropriate thing to do was to come straight to me. Bernie said what I hope all my friends would say -- no. I thanked him. And I realized that I could trust him to protect me, even if I wasn't there to protect myself. Real trust, that's one of the things that turns a normal friend into a best friend."/>
			<outline text="So many friendships in Silicon Valley are based on what one person can do for another. I am lucky because I have friends who just like hanging out and playing and sharing what we can create together. These are the best kinds of friendships. Best friends! Cooool. I'm lucky to have a friend like Bernie."/>
			<outline text="I love hanging out with him, we get giddy together. We rant in Texas accents. It's funny! Bernie is a funny dude, a game designer at birth. An open and vulnerable man. I can relax with him. We've been taking twice-weekly walks for the last couple of years. I imagine we look funny, laughing and talking loudly as we walk thru the woods. But who cares cause we have fun!"/>
			<outline text="Well, there's sad news, but not bad news. Bernie is moving to Los Angeles, to become a full-time game designer for Mattel. This is good news, because it's what he wants. I know, because I listen to him. He wants a steady job. And he's tried lots of other venues for his loving fun, and game design seems to be the best fit. "/>
			<outline text="So look for some great new concepts built around Barbie, Hot Wheels and Cabbage Patch Kids and other Mattel properties. The fun will be deep and profound, no doubt! And subtle. Listen for the Texas twang. "/>
			<outline text="I wish the best for him, because I know that's totally what he deserves. He puts so much of himself into his creations. That's what makes them so coool. It's just sad because he's moving so far away, so no more walks. "/>
			<outline text="I will miss Bernie, in fact, I already do. "/>
			<outline text="***A New Moon Mission!"/>
			<outline text="Hey - it's cool that I get to write. I've definitely been holding onto that one. Glad to let it go, so now I can have more fun. Yeah. The yin and yang of life. A big tree falls, that creates new space for seedlings. Many of them. Which one will grow to touch the sky? It's hard to say. But it's easy to love the potential of any of them."/>
			<outline text="A great new cause came into my life yesterday. It's a political one! And financial. I get to work with some of the best webmasters in the world. We'll hold hands like we did back in February; we'll learn a bunch, and raise some hell for a good cause. "/>
			<outline text="We'll use our communication power to make the world a safer place for creativity. We're already starting to set up the databases and computer networks. It's like a moon mission! Lots of new toys and friends. They asked what kind of hardware I want. I said get a few Macintosh 9500s with lots of RAM. They didn't bat an eyelash. I like this!"/>
			<outline text="***A New Tactic"/>
			<outline text="These days it's harder and harder to have a discussion about software without someone asking if it's wise to invest in the Macintosh considering the continuing stream of bad news from Apple Computer. "/>
			<outline text="I'm trying a new tactic: give them what they want. "/>
			<outline text="OK. You're right! The Mac is a hopeless cause. Pretty soon Apple will go Chapter 11. Hey - let's pick a day. How about September 1? So what will we do on September 2?"/>
			<outline text="It's funny, when I say this, there's an imbalance. I'm propping people up. I guess they figure as long as *someone* invests in this platform, it'll have a life. How would you all feel if there was no Mac? If you care about software, you have to care about this. So what are you doing about it?"/>
			<outline text="More important, what is Apple doing about it? Have they been willing to take any losses? Maybe. They've surely been willing to pass losses onto their shareholders. $740 million last quarter, plus a projected $100 million loss this quarter. A $600 million debt offering a couple of months ago."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="And they pass their losses on to the developers. A Cyberdog-centered Internet strategy, that crowds out the new stuff, and creates the expectation OpenDoc-based nirvana is just around the corner. "/>
			<outline text="Have the individual employees at Apple been willing to accept their share of the pain? Look at the orgchart. It gets fatter. For the most part, the same people are running the show. The same old philosophy that can't find a way to work with Windows and Microsoft, or other Mac developers. No creativity, just fear. A blanket called Infinite Loop that now has lots of holes in it. A sleep that's uncomfortable. Soon the blanket will disappear, and all the sleeping people will have to wake up."/>
			<outline text="***Why OpenDoc?"/>
			<outline text="Would someone at Apple concisely and respectfully explain why they continue to invest in OpenDoc? Are they still viewing Windows as competiton? What will it take for them to let go of this idea? Realistically, there's no chance that the Macintosh will displace Windows as the dominant desktop operating system. We still have a strong position in content tools. But if Apple insists on competing with Windows, we may not have that position much longer."/>
			<outline text="They're mighty picky about where their software comes from. There's magic in the Mac development community. Stuff that's shipped first here, but the world continues to ignore it. The Windows developers are catching up, albeit slowly. Infoworld writes about their products, not ours. Even MacWEEK runs web server benchmarks without our software."/>
			<outline text="I do what I can to shine the spotlight, but it doesn't work as well as I'd like. People may enjoy my writing, but they miss the point. Apple surely doesn't help - when they state their Internet strategy, it's as if my software and much of my friends's software doesn't exist. "/>
			<outline text="***We're an Outpost"/>
			<outline text="Keeping the customers busy with new software is a good tactic. Instead of pushing what we have, Apple is pushing what we don't have. Their booth at MacWorld Expo in early August will be filled with science projects not software. "/>
			<outline text="What's the game plan? Why OpenDoc? Isn't it just like Publish and Subscribe? Did that make the Mac platform stronger, or was it a waste of developer resources? What's the difference? So much coool stuff is happening in the Mac world. But it doesn't fit Apple's view of the world, so you won't see it at their booth. They're still very, very picky."/>
			<outline text="Apple's view seems to be: We're better than Microsoft. OpenDoc is killer. When it catches on, we'll have an insurmountable advantage over Microsoft, and growth will return. We'll keep our jobs, and our view that Apple is the center of the world will be preserved. Be patient, nirvana is almost at hand. Wait. Wait. Wait. Just wait! You'll see."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, they argue with me about whether or not I want to kill AppleScript. Amazing. This is such small potatoes! Hysterics when sharpness, professionalism and creativity are called for. While Cupertino is burning, they're worried about whether the forks go to the left or the right of the soup spoons. No we won't eat cake! There's no time. "/>
			<outline text="We're leading in web content tools. That's where the growth is. Scripting itself isn't a market. It might have been at one time, but not now. Having great scripting tools won't make the platform grow. Making powerful websites happen on a Mac could. "/>
			<outline text="It's time for Amelio to intervene and send an unmistakable message to Apple employees, there's no time to waste. They aren't getting the message when it's presented calmly. The Mac world is on its death bed, and Apple is the reason why. Get with the program Cupertino. The glory days when the Mac was the only graphics platform are over. "/>
			<outline text="We're in a niche, it can be a leading niche, but Microsoft is here to stay. They're not a temporary aberration. They're real. We're an outpost, like Japan or Cuba. Microsoft is a superpower, like Intel or Cisco or Netscape."/>
			<outline text="[Emphatically and parenthetically -- making NT machines is not an acceptable strategy. The day that happens, the Mac developer community will be totally undermined. It'll be Ice Nine Time.]"/>
			<outline text="***They remember too much"/>
			<outline text="Stop looking backward, stop looking at what we lost, and see where we are. If we were growing to the position we are in, instead of shrinking to it, would we be doing a boring technology like OpenDoc, or would we be building a diverse base of market-leading software products and teaching people how to use them?"/>
			<outline text="We don't need evangelists, we need sales people who use software and effectively sell it. A steady stream of press visits, showing the latest new stuff. The developers are cash starved, we can't field a sales force. So the evangelists need to be trained, and then hit the road. Too much focus on Cupertino, not enough focus on the outside world which is starved for real good news from the Mac community, not the slurpy stuff you see at always.apple.com. We're not happy.clams! We're struggling against extinction."/>
			<outline text="The execs running development at Apple appear to remember too much. It's unrealistic to expect them to change their attitude. Say goodbye to the past, and look to the future. A postwar Japan-like strategy is called for, not a superpower strategy. The current development chiefs at Apple act as if they have nuclear weapons when the supply lines aren't working. It's even worse, the air force drops bombs on our own troops! They still do it. Unreal."/>
			<outline text="Apple is so far from a game plan that makes sense, they keep eating their seed corn, now there is no more to eat, no more cash cows to feed their ineffective and untimely R&amp;D. They're going to learn the lesson the hard way, it's way too late for a gentle transition. The numbers are irrefutable. If there ever was a strategy at Apple, it's failed. Isn't that totally clear now?"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to believe it'll still make sense to ship software for Macintosh users, but the doubtful voice inside me keeps getting stronger and stronger."/>
			<outline text="***Seasons Greetings"/>
			<outline text="To the rest of the software world, it's time to consider the possibility that Apple is really going to tube this time. Are you going to stand by and let it happen? Could Larry Ellison really be our salvation? (Doubtful!) What stake do you have in an alternative to Windows? What will the world look like if there is no Macintosh? If you don't like this idea, what are you doing to prevent it from happening? Are you still telling Apple people what they want to hear? Or are you telling them to make the changes now?"/>
			<outline text="I've tried to be patient with the new management at Apple, but the changes, if they're happening at all, are happening too slowly. If Apple management doesn't have the guts to say this, I'll do it for them. A much smaller Apple is called for. That means people will leave and that large previously-sacred projects will be cancelled. "/>
			<outline text="Unless something really changes really soon, it's safe to assume that Apple will disappear. Where will we go from there?"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/16/96; 10:24:42 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Sometime this week"/>
			<outline text="Good morning! "/>
			<outline text="Sometime this week Apple will restate its Internet strategy. It's hard to tell when it will happen, because the Apple website, www.apple.com tells you who, what, where and why, but they didn't say (maybe I missed it?) when. So I imagine Larry Tesler's presentation is either happening today or tomorrow. Whatever. It might be happening right now."/>
			<outline text="Whatever words Tesler actually uses, I bet the message will come down to this. First, we're doing really cool stuff at Apple. And we're sensitive to the needs of developers and we're trying to support them. This means that even though we will compete with developers, we'll only do it when it's in our interests to do so. We won't compete with developers in order to punish them or limit their growth. And we will provide compelling technical and business propositions to developers. We can't do it all."/>
			<outline text="Macintosh web sysops will sit in the audience and wonder what the future holds for the software products they depend on. Developers will wonder if others will follow Apple and try to fit in. The press will report Tesler's remarks against a backdrop of even more financial misery in the Mac market. Venture capitalists and large customers will continue to stay away in droves. "/>
			<outline text="Another step on the road to decline and irrelevance of the Mac platform? Yes, but an unremarkable step, because now there's very little belief in the larger world that this platform is moving in any direction at all, much less moving in the direction of growth and profits. Let's fix that!"/>
			<outline text="***Where I'm Coming From"/>
			<outline text="I'm a Macintosh-based Internet developer. I've shipped shipped seven major releases for the Mac in twelve years, the most recent one in May of this year. I've got a stake in the Macintosh Internet strategy. "/>
			<outline text="I've started two software companies. I have experience dealing with investors, board members, customers and employees, and have done partnership deals with all sizes of companies, from Microsoft and IBM to Bare Bones Software and Aladdin Systems. I've been doing the software company thing for seventeen years. "/>
			<outline text="I've been the CEO a medium-sized company. The investors in my first company made 15 times their money off a $1.25 million investment in six years. I know what it feels like to win. I vastly prefer winning to the alternatives."/>
			<outline text="I've made it my business to develop working and personal friendships with all the leading net-based Mac developers. Realistically (I'm not bragging) I'm a leader in this community. "/>
			<outline text="That's where I'm coming from."/>
			<outline text="***The Macintosh Internet Strategy"/>
			<outline text="These ideas are nothing new, but it's the first time they've been put in writing, or stated publicly. "/>
			<outline text="We, the Macintosh net developer community, have a plan for the evolution of all aspects of the Macintosh Internet world. "/>
			<outline text="Great content tools are the center of our strategy, because that continues to be the center of the Mac market: writers and creative people. "/>
			<outline text="We're building on WebSTAR and compatible server products, to provide access to Mac-based LANs thru the web. It doesn't matter what Apple bundles, we've made our choice, WebSTAR defines the standard server APIs on the Macintosh. If Apple does their own server, it must be compatible with WebSTAR in every respect, in order to preserve the investment that the community has already made, and to encourage continued investment. We will work with Chuck Shotton and his team to define the evolving web server standard for the Mac platform. It's an exciting future. Shotton's role, on a personal level, is central to this process."/>
			<outline text="We will also work to develop easier and faster links from content tools to FTP clients such as Fetch and Anarchie, to make it almost as easy to serve web content on Unix and NT servers. The choice will be with the sysop: serve some or all of your content on other platforms. Always use the right tools and systems. We encourage sysops to be smart, to design the most effective server systems for their authors and users. Our customers are the smartest people, they know what's right. We listen!"/>
			<outline text="Frontier will be enhanced to be easier and more welcoming to AppleScript users, and Perl, tcl, Java, JavaScript and VB Script, and users of any other scripting language that gains a popular following. A proposal is circulating among developers thru the Macintosh Scripting mailing list."/>
			<outline text="Connections between Frontier and content tools such as BBEdit, Globetrotter, PageMill and Home Page will be enhanced, allowing people who prefer to work in a wizzy environment to be part of the system management features in Frontier. Our goal is to make the Mac the most powerful environment for all aspects of website management, from the written word to delivered page. We'll keep digging!"/>
			<outline text="In partnership with other Macintosh developers we will move Internet Config into the next generation, to support more shared information between applications, and to act as the persistent storage system for all activities on the Macintosh, not just net-related activities."/>
			<outline text="We will develop standard APIs for controlling net based protocols from all levels of software, from C applications to scripts. There's been too much re-invention going on in this market. FTP, HTTP, Telnet, Gopher, etc. are standard protocols that must be supported at the shared library level, and accessible to all software running on the platform."/>
			<outline text="In terms of market share, we want to at least hold the approximately 20-percent share that the Mac platform enjoys in the Internet world, and increase the share in this space by five percent in the next year. This is a good financial strategy because the growth in the net is much greater than growth in other market segments. Profits are available here that are elusive elsewhere."/>
			<outline text="Perhaps most important, we will develop versions of all our standards for deployment on Windows and perhaps Unix. We will offer this software to Microsoft for distribution with Windows. Having listened carefully, I believe Microsoft is open to supporting standards that come from the Mac development community. "/>
			<outline text="It's clearly in the interests of the Mac community to see our ideas become broadly popular, not just for Mac users. I believe, with Microsoft and other's support, cross-platform web standards can come from the Mac community, as they have come from the Unix community. The benefit for Windows users is that their world grows more quickly, as unique know-how flows from the Mac to other platforms. "/>
			<outline text="If we can develop this flow of standards, more developers will be able to raise money and do public offerings. This is really important, not just for developers; Mac users will benefit because the flow of new stuff on the Mac will continue, and in some important areas, the Mac platform will lead Windows, and that lead will be understood and respected and acknowledged by the press and large customers. That's the only way to stop the erosion in sales and market share. We require public confidence to return to growth."/>
			<outline text="It's a new attitude. Let's take ourselves seriously. That will encourage others to respect us too. We define ourselves. We do great stuff on this platform! No more waiting for Apple. Apple's role in this world is clear -- sell computers that run our software. Fix bugs. Make it faster. We will offer Apple compelling business and technical propositions. They will choose to listen or not. We'll go ahead in either case."/>
			<outline text="To developers, qualified venture investors, platform vendors, Microsoft and Apple -- do you support this plan? If so, send me private email and a URL and I'll start a page of pointers. "/>
			<outline text="It's all negotiable. If you'd like to see changes, or if I missed anything, let's start a discussion. Step one is to get into agreement. Step two is to get the money flowing. And step three is to ship wonderful new software. Let's go! It's time..."/>

			<outline text="***Buzz about the New York Times"/>

			<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/0722soft.html"/>
			<outline text="The usual caveat applies about the Times on the web. You have to supply a password. I hope you have one, because this article is worth reading, if only because everyone I've talked with this morning is talking about it."/>
			<outline text="There's nothing new in the piece. We've known for at least a year that the influence of the web on PC application software is complete. Every tool is being adapted to be web-aware. All apps will export to HTML. Even better, view HTML as your native file format. "/>
			<outline text="Our computers are connected. If a document has web-based multimedia capabilities, that's just being competitive, not revolutionary. The web is the platform we write software for. Not Windows and not Macintosh. Microsoft, very wisely, is adapting to this reality. Smart move. Is it insidious? No way. Is it revolutionary? Hmmm. No. The trend may be revolutionary. Microsoft's courage certainly is remarkable. "/>
			<outline text="***Influence"/>
			<outline text="In the last couple of weeks I've gotten messages from officers of two very large companies saying that I'm not making them happy. People are taking my stuff personally. They're not liking it. They want me to stop."/>
			<outline text="The answer is no. Most of my readers don't work for these large companies. Many of them are small developers or webmasters or people who work at other large companies that use technology products. Hey -- some of my readers are just people who have computers. They deserve to know what's going on. A frank unwashed discussion of one person's opinion is my job. That's all it is."/>
			<outline text="My stories are just stories. My point of view. Occasionally I make personal comments, and I always regret doing that. So I'm more careful, but sometimes they sneak thru. In these two cases, people were reacting to pieces that contained no personal comments. So taking the comments personally is not appropriate."/>
			<outline text="People may be casual about these comments, they have the right to do that. The warning may be couched in friendship, but they are not seen as friendly comments."/>
			<outline text="They raise an interesting question -- am I a journalist? Should I be accorded the same tolerance as a writer for the Times or the Wall Street Journal or the Palo Alto Weekly? Yes, I think so. "/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates writes a column for the New York Times where he speaks his mind, and presumably doesn't have to make anyone happy but himself. Stewart Alsop is now a venture capitalist, but his editorials still run on the back page of InfoWorld, where he used to be editor in chief. They're still worth reading, even more so, because both Alsop and Gates are entering new territory. I'm interested in what they have to say, not despite of their other jobs, but because of them."/>
			<outline text="Our world is in flux. Even a small developer can have a big voice. This is cool! It levels the playing field. I feel, that as long as I stay true to what I believe, there's value in what I write. As soon as I start trying to achieve an effect at one or more large companies with my pieces, they would lose their relevance. "/>
			<outline text="Some people ask whether they're meeting Dave Winer the journalist or Dave Winer the software entrepreneur. I say there's only one Dave Winer. I'm a software developer who writes, or viewed from the other side of the coin, I'm a journalist who develops software. If I have to grapple with this, I can definitely understand the confusion with people I work with. So I treat business conversations as off the record. And I object when, during a business discussion, someone whines about something I said in DaveNet not being flattering enough."/>
			<outline text="Being an independent developer and an independent writer are similar things. The ethics of one are just like the ethics of the other. People, by default, seem to respect journalists, or at least fear them; and sometimes that seems like respect. I've also learned that many people judge developers by the size of their companies, not by the quality of their work. I hope to change that. "/>
			<outline text="If you respect my writing, I hope you take my software seriously. To do one without the other is to miss the point."/>
			<outline text="If I criticize Microsoft, Netscape or Apple, or you -- that's because what they're doing is important or interesting enough to be examined. "/>
			<outline text="I speak for no one but myself. I've had my opinions lumped in with the opinions of other people, and I don't like that. "/>
			<outline text="If you don't want to be looked at, get off the tree. As Jean-Louis Gassee says, the monkey who climbs to the top of the tree runs the risk of having his butt visible. It's hard to cover your ass when you're on top. If the buck stops on your desk, be thankful, lots of people want what you have. Take the heat, or as someone said, get out of the kitchen."/>

Every time I do one of these I want to do another. Put a mike in my hand. An audience in front. I roll up my sleeves. Turn on the tunes. I move into the audience. We chat. It's cool. We talk about personal stuff without getting personal. It's animated. Multimedia! No one reads the newspaper. I can do this. And I like doing it."/>
			<outline text="So, I know where I want to do the next one -- at Stewart Alsop's Agenda conference in September in Palm Springs.

I know John thru my association with Symantec, we were both on its board of directors in the late eighties. He's backed lots of successful high tech ventures, including Sun, Compaq, Lotus and Netscape. John is intense! He takes risks, and sticks his neck out. Doerr has focus, and sometimes this frustrates people who work with him. But watch out when he focuses on something, because something could happen. "/>
			<outline text="He talked, I listened. Politics! A proposition on the November ballot that threatens to completely change the rules of operating a corporation in California. It will make the lawyers more powerful. Much more! It would cripple the high tech financial system. It'll be impossible to manage a company, not just in California, because the prop covers all companies that have shareholders that live in California. Only fools will expose themselves. Only fools will invest. Make sure you're broke before you go public. Hmmm. How does that work?"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Spider Web&quot;, 7/12/96, I wrote about this as a new moon mission web project. A chance to develop new collaborative technology. A successor to the 24 Hours of Democracy project. Holding hands in cyberspace. "/>

			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/strikesuits/"/>
			<outline text="Anyone who cares about technology should read the articles. Anyone who owns stock in any company with a presence in California. Any journalist that covers business or cares about jobs. "/>
			<outline text="It's a revolutionary proposition, designed to establish a new high growth branch of the legal profession -- lawyers who wait for a stock's price to dive, then attack, and get their go-away money. "/>
			<outline text="Freedom is something everyone must enjoy or else there's no freedom for anyone. Money counts. I want growth. I want people to keep their jobs. Anyone other than the attack attorneys should want this too."/>
			<outline text="On the positive side, this is an opportunity to organize the resources of the web, the high flow sites and individual home pages, small companies and large ones; and cover this story from every angle. The web is already opposed to the proposition. There's huge support from the companies Doerr has invested in, and he's working on organizing the venture capital community, and the companies they support. It's already a very big project, and it's just starting."/>
			<outline text="It's a no-brainer for me, this is a cause I support, and I like it because it will help make web energy flow in new ways. New technology applied to guaranteeing the right to make new technology. Makes sense to me."/>

			<outline text="***Jim Gable on OpenDoc"/>
			<outline text="I saw your DaveNet about OpenDoc and obviously felt I should respond. Here it is. The reason why we're doing OpenDoc is to make it easy to put software together. The benefits are direct for Mac users regardless of what Windows does."/>
			<outline text="This doesn't necessarily include a professional programmer like you. Dave Winer can sit down and fire off a script to do incredible stuff. And if that doesn't work, Dave Winer can fire up Metrowerks and write a great app. The vast majority of users can't. Hell, I can't! But I can add Netscape plug-ins to a Clarisworks document by dragging them in. I can add a Java applet (or Bean!) by dragging it in. I can add other OpenDoc parts. OpenDoc is like a universal plug-in system for the Mac OS. That's cool."/>
			<outline text="Professional developers certainly can take advantage too. Digital Harbor is working on a product that is going to have lots of Internet connectivity built-in but they did very little of the Internet coding. They just include Cyberdog and other Net parts. But it looks like one product. The next version of Clarisworks will be very Net savvy, but again without as much coding. Apple will be offering a lot of Internet features in our next release of Mac OS and many of them will come through parts. Some of these parts may come from developers outside Apple, but it's easier for us to integrate their work now. It gets us away from re-compiling thousands of lines when we only need to upgrade a single feature. The end user doesn't even have to know. That's pretty cool."/>
			<outline text="In house developers (and this means schools with Macintosh at least as much as big companies) are extremely interested. It's easy to build an information 'dashboard' with OpenDoc parts and Java applets and other elements. After showing this to a group of analysts from one of the major corporate consulting firms, they simply said, &quot;You can't do anything like this on Windows.&quot; We have demo pages from schools and businesses that show the progress. You'll see it at MacWorld. Some people are even talking about building custom applications for given markets or even specific groups. That's quite cool."/>
			<outline text="Like all projects, we have wins and loses. I don't mean to say that everything is perfect. Implementing parts is too hard unless you use the OpenDoc Frameworks (ODF). Denali will help some people a lot with a visual tool for building parts. Implementing containers remains too hard. Claris is helping by making their library available. That will help. Our team is working on easier versions as well. Like any software project, you get it shipping and you make it better as you go."/>
			<outline text="I know OpenDoc is not your favorite project, but there are hundreds of developers working on OpenDoc today and over 2,000 firms have joined ci Labs. They're not all nuts. There is good technology here. SOM (the System Object Model from IBM) allows developers to use parts written in different languages and offers insulation between version releases. A document using OpenDoc parts will typically be vastly smaller than a similar document using OLE parts. It works well for moving components of software across the Net. The Windows version just went Beta. Things are happening!"/>
			<outline text="I don't pretend that a short note will change your opinion, but I hope after MacWorld you feel safe concluding that it's got interesting angles. At least!"/>
			<outline text="***A few comments"/>
			<outline text="First, thanks Jim for participating in this discussion."/>
			<outline text="I can already see what will happen at MacWorld by talking with my friends in the developer community. They're trading booth space for Apple's support. As often has been the case, Apple has made enticing propositions to developers. My concern is bigger than OpenDoc, I believe Apple should be listening to enticing propositions *from* developers. "/>
			<outline text="I also think that developers who trade features for booth space are taking the short view; such expedient development should not be encouraged. My community, script writers, webmasters, content developers and sysops, haven't been offered any booth space by Apple. It was pretty clear. If we want Apple's support, get busy implementing OpenDoc. When we look back a couple of years from now, I think we'll see the folly of this. Delivered software counts more than technology demos. But I could be wrong! So..."/>
			<outline text="I'm glad that Apple is finally making the big pitch for OpenDoc to end users. This is it. Either it works or it doesn't. If the market doesn't develop in a reasonable amount of time, we can hope that Apple will stop hogging the PR channels, quiet down and let developers make new markets happen, as we have been, whether or not we build on Apple's latest developer framework. This OpenDoc stuff is quite distracting, at a time when we need to focus the press and customers on what really is being accomplished in the Mac development community, OpenDoc has been a summary of what has not yet been accomplished. That's changing. I'm happy!"/>
			<outline text="Another perspective, while OpenDoc was in development, Apple went from being a leader in the desktop computing market to being something other than a leader. OpenDoc may be better than OLE, I don't know, but that isn't the issue anymore. OpenDoc seems to have been usurped by the web browsers, Netscape, Microsoft, and others. "/>
			<outline text="Is OpenDoc/Cyberdog more exciting than Nashville? Microsoft is porting Nashville to the Mac. (John Markoff, take note!) What does Apple think of this? People like Nashville. I say it's time to put religion to the side and for Apple to apply the elegant Embrace and Extend tactic that Microsoft uses so effectively."/>

			<outline text="I was talking with a veteran reporter from a major business pub last week. He's covered every major industry event and trend since the early 80s, sometimes on an exclusive basis. He's respected, a thinker, an amazing rolodex. He's a lightning rod, an assimilator of facts and opinion, but like all reporters that attain his stature, he's an industry leader in his own right. He decides what direction he wants the industry to turn. His pieces are signposts. They redirect traffic. "/>
			<outline text="These are very powerful people, don't miss that. I've seen reporters go after companies and then see the companies go away. They can waste time with technological dead-ends that they find intriguing. And they can support revolutions like word processing and the Internet because they directly impact the reporters lives. It's no mystery that they cover what they understand. They're heavily influenced by their experience."/>
			<outline text="Many reporters use Macs. So they pay extra attention to Apple. They had expectations. They still do! Where's the Apple of days gone by? When will the spark return? We all loved the first experiences we had with Macs. What a lovely idea it was, back then. Can we have some more?"/>
			<outline text="***Remember"/>
			<outline text="Pause for a moment and, if you use a Mac, or used to use a Mac, remember how it was for you when you first used one. I remember very well, walking into the Mac building at Apple in 1983 and getting my first glimpse. &quot;This machine is for me.&quot; The thought just formed in my head. "/>
			<outline text="It did something that no computer did in the past. It asked you to love it. Before that computers were loveable, but they weren't cute. The original Mac fully accessed our Inner Mommy, I've written about this before, it's the spot inside of us that adores bright-eyed little things that are trying."/>
			<outline text="Oh the first Macs were trying. 128K memory. 400K floppies. No hard disk. But you'd have to pinch yourself as you move around the windows and pull down the menus. &quot;Am I really doing this?&quot; Amazing stuff. It gives me goosebumps to recall the feeling of presence and excitement I experienced."/>
			<outline text="When the machine shipped it was like a festival of love. I was young. There was nothing but blue sky. We found home."/>
			<outline text="***Now let that go"/>
			<outline text="We transferred the joy we felt about the machine to the creators of the machine. The people weren't as generous as the little machine, it turns out. But they're gone. They're not young anymore. It never was Apple. It wasn't the people who did the machine. It was us, it was the times, whatever it was, it's gone."/>
			<outline text="It's gone, if it ever really existed. Breathe deeply. It's gone. Really feel it."/>
			<outline text="It's gone. We aren't going back there. The joy is gone! "/>

			<outline text="I've written pieces like this before. They usually happen while I'm patiently waiting for my ISP to believe me, and then do something about it. My server, www.scripting.com is back on the air now and appears to be healthy. This piece was written a few hours ago when things weren't going so well."/>
			<outline text="***Oh man"/>
			<outline text="Network problems! All over the place. As of 8:11AM on 7/31/96, my website is off the air. It's been a comedy of errors. Laurel and Hardy meet the worldwide web. In the month of July, my Internet Service Provider (ISP) has thrown all my cards in the air twice, both times scheduled, and both times without notifying me that they were going to do it, and both times they dealt with me unprofessionally when I contacted them for help getting back on the air."/>
			<outline text="The latest outage started yesterday at 1:30PM. I sat down to check my email and noticed that my server hadn't responded to a hit in an hour. I checked my email. No connection. I connected to mail.well.com thru a modem connection, avoiding the Internet, signing on the old fashioned way. It worked. The Well is on the air. "/>
			<outline text="I called my ISP, Internex, at 408-327-2200. After five minutes wading thru their voicemail menus, I got a network status report. If you're connecting thru the Palo Alto POP, please be aware that we're off the air for five hours due to planned maintenence. "/>
			<outline text="I knew there was no point in calling them until 5PM. I took a walk. Returned some phone calls. Took a nap. At 5:30, my server started getting some hits, but far too few. The domain name server was still down so I couldn't check my email. "/>
			<outline text="I've seen this before. Their router is broken. I don't know what it looks like from their end, but it's unmistakeable from my end. Been there before. One more time around the loop."/>
			<outline text="***It's a rough ride"/>
			<outline text="They can't keep the ride smoothe for me. They throw every excuse at the problem, everything other than taking responsibility for keeping my connection constant."/>
			<outline text="Typically I have two or three ISP emergencies every month. Each time it happens, I have to stop everything. My server is off the air. My customers and partners can't get the software and information they need. DaveNet is silent. My software development halts. So does business development and friendship development. I *use* the net. I've built my professional life around it. My time is expensive. It costs me large amounts of money when I lose the connection. I also lose my perspective. "/>
			<outline text="It's true, in the last couple of years I've learned a lot about networking from all the outages. I've learned how to read a whole new set of tea leaves. Given a few more years of this hell I'll really understand what's going on. But I don't want to understand all the gory details. I want to invent my own gory details."/>
			<outline text="Every time I get stuck in this position I shrug my shoulders, and say that this is just the way it is. Then, this morning, almost 18 hours after the outage, and my world is *still* not working, I realized that this is the wrong answer. Don't accept this. Much better is possible. Use DaveNet for a good cause. Let's define a business opportunity. A place where the buck stops, where there's professional system management and customer service. You pay a premium for it, but in return for the premium, you get great service. "/>
			<outline text="***The Internet is a Platform"/>
			<outline text="The way the net works now is no good. Imagine if the same applied to the computers we use. I wouldn't be able to always write software in the language of my choice. Sometimes my scripting software would break, requiring me to use a C compiler to dig out, to rebuild my world. And sometimes the C compiler would break too, forcing me to use an assembler. I don't even own an assembler anymore!"/>
			<outline text="We've come a long way in desktop computers. They usually work. If they don't, hop in the car, write a check and bring home a new computer. You're never down for more than a few hours if you have good backups and if money isn't the object."/>
			<outline text="This is not true in the ISP world. The norm is outages. Companies growing too fast for their customer's good. A lack of organization on the other end. Lack of good testing procedures. The system is cobbled together. The wires are exposed, they're always tripping over them. Their monitoring software doesn't detect the problems, so customers have to. And often the customers don't have the expertise to explain why the system isn't working. Tech support reps won't treat people like adults (or customers!) unless they speak the jargon. Now I do speak the jargon, so I can see clearly how unacceptable the current situation is."/>
			<outline text="***Compaq"/>
			<outline text="In 1984 I ran a small software company. We made products for the IBM PC and compatibles, mostly. We were also in the Mac business, but it was a small part of what we were doing. The focus was on PCs. We had a hodgepodge of different brands of computers in the office. We were having the same kinds of problems then that we are having now with ISPs."/>
			<outline text="Then came Compaq. In my opinion, they commercialized the PC, made it work, and supported the product. When we had a problem, we called them. They solved problems, even though they were growing fast, they were selling something we wanted -- uptime. We could stay focused on what we were doing, we could build on the PC platform, because our PCs worked most of the time, and when they didn't we could easily get them back in order."/>
			<outline text="We standardized on Compaq. All new machines purchased by the company had to be Compaqs. When we made this choice, the service got even better."/>
			<outline text="***The Compaq of ISPs"/>
			<outline text="All the battles over standards, Java, ActiveX, etc are moot if we don't have reliable network service. There's an opportunity out there. I first wrote about it in 1994, in a postscript to &quot;Mark Stahlman Gets Real&quot;. Ironically, you can't read about it today because my server is off the air, and at this moment I have no hope of getting it back on the air. If I struggle enough, hey, it will come back. But they'll knock it out again in a few weeks or days and I'll have to do it all again."/>
			<outline text="I yearn for the Compaq of ISPs. The no-brainer choice. The one that everyone else is going with. A large capacity net from day one, so I don't have to feel their growing pains. A plan for expanding so that service doesn't degrade when they grow to the next level."/>
			<outline text="I would help someone bootstrap such a service. But only if they're really serious. There's a huge need. It can't be filled by a fly-by-night approach. This is the one area where we want and need a boring non-innovative player. Make the net work for people who don't want to deal with all the gory details."/>

			<outline text="***Standards Bodies"/>
			<outline text="Over the last week I've been invited to participate in two standards bodies. I've never been part of one before but I've certainly read about them. I come from the personal computer software business, where standards are proprietary, even if they're open. Yes, I do see the irony! Coool."/>
			<outline text="A friend from the Sun Unix world has a different perspective. &quot;Get a room,&quot; she said, &quot;have a BOF meeting.&quot; Only a Unix person would think of the world this way. At the Expos at the Comdexes and WWDCs, there's no opportunity for ad hoc collaboration. It's all orchestrated to simulate collaboration. The press can't tell the difference. "/>
			<outline text="Big press releases spoken about on gigantic stages with huge screens, which usually means that one big company strongarmed a bunch of less powerful companies into giving them a piece of their future for the price of space in a tradeshow booth. "/>
			<outline text="***A bone for Netscape?"/>
			<outline text="The net teaches us how to work with other people. Microsoft is releasing source code for things they want to be standards. I gulped when I heard about their plan for ActiveX. How unusual! How brave. How different. I guess I have to release some source code too? How much? Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="And Microsoft complains when Netscape tries to claim a proprietary lead. I understand why Netscape moves quicker than the standards bodies, and I think I understand why Microsoft complains when they do. Netscape started in the Unix world, where open standards are the norm. Microsoft grew to become the PC software industry where they were not. Now an amalgram is happening, a mix, a bit of the each is washing off on the other."/>
			<outline text="Netscape is hiring out of the Silicon Valley talent pool. They're getting introspective like Apple. They're young, inexperienced, idealistic leaders. Microsoft has seasoned execs, they live for battle. Netscape gave them one. And it appears it's a fight to the end. Netscape is in the unenviable position of needing to defeat Microsoft. But why does Microsoft have to defeat Netscape?"/>
			<outline text="I wonder if Microsoft could acknowledge Netscape in some meaningful way. It's clear that Netscape led Microsoft into the net. I'm sure that Microsoft would acknowledge that. Does Microsoft see any value to having a healthy growing Netscape? Is there any place Netscape can move that Microsoft won't move to also? This may not be possible for Microsoft. But, if it is, we can all win. "/>
			<outline text="We want Netscape to grow. We also want them to learn. Microsoft can be an excellent teacher, and can help Netscape and others compete more effectively. But is there any area of specialization that Microsoft can look to Netscape to lead in? If not, the complaints will continue. How can Microsoft expect Netscape to play fair if Microsoft doesn't grant Netscape the right to exist?"/>
			<outline text="These are funny times. Microsoft is investing in the survival of the Mac platform. This will become clearer next week when a new standards body is announced and Microsoft's role is evident. I've been over it with the Microsoft people ad infinitum. I'm convinced that their motives are what they say they are. Gates and his execs look at a world without the Macintosh and they don't like what they see. So they're making an investment in being sure that the Mac gets back on track."/>
			<outline text="Surely the same reasoning that led Microsoft to invest in the Mac can lead them to see Netscape as a positive force, even when they're fudding Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft, throw Netscape a bone. Make it a big one. And maybe we can all work together even more effectively."/>
			<outline text="***Advice for Netscape"/>
			<outline text="I spoke with Eric Hahn, ehahn@netscape.com, a Netscape exec, who's working on standards for net-based collaboration software, and working on his own collaborative software. He was the founder of Collabra, which merged with Netscape in 1995. I had some advice for Eric. In the spirit of openness I'd like to share that advice with my readers."/>
			<outline text="First, make a decision. Maybe it's OK to *not* support open standards all the time. Reading the tea leaves, it seems that sometimes Netscape doesn't. Be precisely truthful. Resolve the contradiction that I, and others, see. "/>
			<outline text="If Netscape always implements the open standard in synch with the standards bodies, where's the opportunity for Netscape to win and deliver value to their shareholders? This is not the University of Illinois, this is the PC software market. The politics here are bigger and even more intense."/>
			<outline text="Finally, the best advice possible -- hire Steve Ballmer. Give him 20 percent of the stock in your company. Marc and Steve would be an unbeatable combo."/>
			<outline text="***Laurel &amp; Hardy on the Internet"/>
			<outline text="My last piece, &quot;The Compaq of ISPs&quot;, got an unprecedented response. It seems I'm not the only one who sees an opportunity to improve Internet access for smaller net users. Here's what I heard..."/>
			<outline text="Service is too shaky, professionalism is too hard to find. But there are exceptions, services that are focusing on excellence first. I think this is the right way to go. We're in the period when reputations are being established. The initial rush of enthusiasm for the net is settling down and people are recapitulating and deciding how they want to go forward for the next few years. I know that's where I am. "/>
			<outline text="What do I value most? Uptime, throughput, and (get this!) personal relationships. I want the people at my ISP to get to know me. Visit my website, watch my News page. I want them to learn that I often get it right. I want them to trust me, and I want them to help me. Get rid of the glitches, then work with me. Suggest ways we can do better. Get to know how I'm using the net and develop services that are complementary. There are lots of collaborations possible. "/>
			<outline text="An example, I'd like to have a upstreaming arrangement, where once an hour, a faster server, upstream from me, polls my server for changed files. I want the convenience of a LAN-based website, but the performance advantages of serving static pages from a dumber server. The dynamic pages stay close to home. The ones that don't change gravitate upstream. This requires cooperative ISPing. "/>
			<outline text="Outages. There should be a financial penalty to the ISP for every one. The penalty should percolate up the chain. A guarantee of uptime, or your money back. That would be a welcome policy for people like me. I would pay more for such a guarantee."/>
			<outline text="Scheduled outages require notification. If a scheduled outage happens without notification, the penalty should be much greater, like a year's free service. I would believe that kind of a promise. Acts of god don't count, but some ISPs don't even *attempt* to tell users when they're going down. Newsgroups and web pages don't count. At least email notification is required. A voicemail message would be cool. [You can automate voicemail. PacBell does it. Ask them how.]"/>
			<outline text="Net access providers who provide great honest service, admit their mistakes, remember that the customer is always right, pay for their sins, and truly care about their customers and their businesses, will be the ones that survive the shakeout. Let's make sure that's what happens. Let's take some positive steps."/>
			<outline text="Let's put a system in place where we can share info about who the best ISPs are. Think of it as the Connoisseur's Guide to the Internet. Let's look at the Great ISPs of the world. Show us what an ISP looks like on the inside. Review them like we review software products."/>
			<outline text="***I received so many replies! "/>

Even when the staff were at the IETF conference they were available and were able to fix a small problem."/>
			<outline text="Before Zocalo we'd been through a number of different Internet providers to offer our web pages (since fall of 1994) and none have performed like Zocalo -- so far they come closest to meeting the performance requirements that you speak of in your rant. They are not large, but because they limit their business to serious businesses it is much more managable.

And they only support high-speed connections --- frame-relay, fractional T1, etc. No modem accounts, etc. They don't have ISDN because they believe frame-relay is a better deal (fixed cost, no per minute costs)."/>

My current solution, although, not quite yet the &quot;Compaq of ISPs&quot; is a little company based in Berkeley called DNAI (Direct Network Access, Inc.).

My home ISDN is from Russian Hill in SF through PacBell (of course) and then to them (they use Ascend's Max 400s, so if you have an Ascend ISDN box you get both B channels and proprietary 4:1 real time compression as well -- which feels every bit as fast as a private T-1 -- real throughput of 300+K/sec).

Look for me and Sally Atkins at the House of Blues in Cambridge. I'll be the guy wearing the Cybersmith t-shirt. I might even step on your toes!"/>
			<outline text="I'll be in the World Trade Center, at Booth #5328, sharing space with Akimbo, Bare Bones, Clearway, Maxum, Metrowerks, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Starnine and other net-based developers. With a little luck, I'll be demoing our threaded web-based bulletin-board system. I first wrote about this software in &quot;The Interactive Website&quot;, 6/8/95. It was too early then, I believe it's just the right time now. We'll see!"/>

			<outline text="There's a major announcement being made today. A new body focused on creating standards from the great client, content, serving and scripting tools that only run on the Macintosh. "/>
			<outline text="I believe it's important that we export our standards to other platforms, much as German and Japanese cars run on American roads, our technology will play on Windows and Unix. I believe this is critical for us to be effective on the Mac platform."/>
			<outline text="A platform is a lot of things. I want the Mac Internet platform to be a place of growth. And I want to participate in that growth."/>
			<outline text="The Macintosh Internet Developers Association. MIDAS. The press release is going out over the Business Wire right now. It's being talked about at the keynote at the Hancock Center, going on right now. And coming to you live from the Expo floor, via DaveNet, you get to be part of the announcement."/>
			<outline text="***Macintosh Internet Developer Association"/>
			<outline text="Formation of Macintosh Internet Developers Association (MIDAS) Announced at MacWorld"/>
			<outline text="Group to Act as Clearinghouse for Macintosh Internet Client, Content and Server Standards "/>
			<outline text="Boston, MA August 7, 1996 --MacWorld-- A consortium of Internet software developers for the Macintosh, representing the entire spectrum of commercial, independent, and educational developers, announced the formation of the Macintosh Internet Developers' Association (MIDAS) at MacWorld Boston. Among the members of MIDAS are Akimbo Systems, Aladdin Systems, Apple Computer, Inc., BareBones Software, Clearway Technologies, Cornell University, InterCon Systems, Maxum Development, Microsoft Corporation, Netscape Communications Corporation, ResNova Software, Stairways Software, the StarNine division of Quarterdeck Corporation, and Userland Software. "/>
			<outline text="The charter of MIDAS calls for a forum in which Macintosh developers devise and refine standards and techniques for Mac-based Internet software, publish Mac-related standards proposals and documents, and coordinate activities with other standards groups such as IETF and W3C. MIDAS will also work to sustain and grow a robust market for Macintosh Internet software."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The Macintosh provides the best platform on the Net today for integrating scripting environments and content tools,&quot; remarked Dave Winer, president of Userland Software. &quot;MIDAS's collective effort will ensure that the Mac continues to lead in this area and that important standards such as Internet Config are carried forward and ported to other important platforms.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;We think MIDAS will help the Macintosh reach its fullest potential on the Internet, both as a platform and business opportunity for developers,&quot; commented Chuck Shotton, Fellow at Quarterdeck Corporation. &quot;MIDAS provides the perfect venue for us to work closely with other developers to refine web server standards for the Macintosh.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;The Macintosh Internet community has worked together informally for years, producing such standards as Internet Config, command-clicking of URLs and the GURL AppleEvent suite.&quot; said Peter N Lewis, CEO of Stairways Software. &quot;MIDAS gives us a way of continuing this effort.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;MIDAS has an important role to play both in creating a common context for Macintosh-based Internet innovators to leverage each others' work, as well as to offer the benefits of their insight to the broader Internet standards community which builds on all platforms,&quot; said Martin Haeberli, director of technology at Netscape Communications Corporation. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;As a MIDAS member, Netscape plans to work with MIDAS and Apple to help build consensus on the adoption of open internet standards such as common Java Runtime APIs and IPv6 and thereby drive internet-based business opportunities for the Macintosh developer community.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Among the first orders of business MIDAS expects to take up are discussions about web server standards, including the CGI standard, WebSTAR API, and server-side Java and developing standards for tighter integration between different types of Internet tools, including content creation tools, scripting environments, and browsers, such as BBEdit, Cyberdog, Frontier, Globetrotter, HomePage, Internet Explorer, NetCloak, NetForms, Navigator, and PageMill. In addition, MIDAS will examine proposals for providing system-level integration of basic Internet client services such as HTTP, FTP, and Mail. The current GetURL Apple event, FTP, and the Embedded HTML for Macintosh pictures standards will also be reviewed."/>
			<outline text="&quot;MIDAS applies the open process of Web standard introduction and evolution to the Macintosh.&quot; said Don Bradford, general manager, IPTD Crossplatform, Microsoft Corporation. &quot;It offers a focused venue for Macintosh developers to introduce opportunities, discuss challenges, propose solutions and disseminate information. We welcome this opportunity to participate.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;MIDAS will help us ensure that the recently introduced 'Virtual T1' technology is compatible with the full range of Macintosh Internet tools.&quot; commented Mark Kriegsman, president of Clearway Technologies. &quot;It's good for our business, and it's great for our customers.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;The Mac Internet Developer's Association sends a clear message: the vibrant entrepreneurial community that has driven Apple's position on the Internet is continuing to focus on making the Mac the leading 'place to be.'&quot; said Heidi Roizen, vice-president of developer relations at Apple Computer, Inc. &quot;There's tremendous brain-power represented in this group and we are thrilled to have them focusing attention on the Macintosh.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Developers interested in joining MIDAS can do so by sending e-mail to midas@biap.com with a subject of &quot;subscribe.&quot; More information is at the temporary MIDAS Web site: http://www.biap.com/midas/."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/12/96; 7:21:04 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Boston, then Blackout"/>
			<outline text="I woke Saturday in Boston. It rained at night, it never does that in California in the summer. Big thunderstorm! Wow. I've said it before, I miss the drama. You never get it in the west, but it's common in the east."/>
			<outline text="I took a long walk on Saturday morning thru the heart of colonial Boston. I was reminded that our country was founded in revolution. These people were idealists. They believed in an educated and armed populace. They lived under the tyranny of mediocrity. People vested in the way things were, far away, out of touch, holding onto the past. Their creativity longed for expression. Many of them had to die to be free. I forgot that."/>
			<outline text="In California we're far away from the spirit of independence and revolution that our country was founded on. Maybe they are in Boston too, but they can't be quite as far because the reminders are everywhere -- on the statues on Commonwealth Ave, in the slogans on the post offices and courthouses and libraries. This country was founded on an ideology. You can't miss it in Boston. At least this tourist couldn't."/>
			<outline text="Later that day I flew across the country. It was an uneventful flight until we got to San Francisco's airport. We're on the runway. The pilot comes on the speaker. &quot;The main terminal is experiencing a power outage.&quot; Wow. That's never happened before. Someone on the plane has a radio. Seven states are blacked out. Wow! Yah. Takes your breath away."/>
			<outline text="Two hours later, they roll a set of stairs to the back of the plane. Entering the terminal, it's dark and empty and quiet. Hot and lovely. The speaker sytstem works, an anxious and impressive recorded female voice warns of security breaches. Rounding a corner, a scene from a third world country -- a few thousand angry people -- they've been waiting a while. These are the people who want to leave the airport via an airplane, not via a car as I do. I stop and talk with a few people. What's going on here? They're hot and not happy. "/>
			<outline text="I thought of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a book I read and was impressed with as a teenager. In her story, the world economy collapses because the people who hold it up get tired of the whining of the politicians, and decide to disappear. The book has incredibly graphic scenes of the collapse of civilization. It's a naive premise, but there's an element of truth that remains with me as an adult. Someday the system may collapse as Rand said it would. It could get ugly. This airport scene reminds me."/>
			<outline text="I made my way thru the crowd. People pushing and shoving. Children screaming. Parents screaming! I wondered."/>
			<outline text="Do we understand how high we have climbed? Do we understand what we have left behind? What are our principles? Do we stand for anything? Do we stand for each other? A hot day on the west coast can knock out all our technology. If our airports and computers stopped working tomorrow what would we be left with? Do you know the people you think you're close to? How long has it been since you've listened to them? What if you had to depend on them for your survival. Could you? Do your friendships, your relationships, mean anything?"/>
			<outline text="These are the questions that floated thru my mind as I drove back to my dark and hot house on Saturday evening."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;pc&quot;&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; Computing, Inc."/>
			<outline text="Hey -- there's a bright spot in the Mac world. Power Computing was everywhere at MacWorld Expo. Their T-shirts are incredible. A picture of a tough determined punkish little kid, an old-fashioned one, saying &quot;Let's Kick Intel's Butt!&quot;. Yeah! Why not? They claim to have the fastest desktop computer in the world, a 225 megahertz MacOS system. I want one! They say &quot;We're fighting back for the Mac.&quot; Ye-hi! Me too."/>
			<outline text="They were everywhere. A big noisy fun booth. A 225-foot bungie jumping tower across from the World Trade Center. T-shirts everywhere. They're having fun over at Power Computing. The little dude that wants to kick Intel's butt deserves our support. Right on!"/>
			<outline text="But I have a question -- where's their laptop? I think a Power Computing laptop would be killer. Where is it? It's amazing that they don't have one. I'd be very happy to hear from people at Power Computing. Comments are on the record unless you specifically state otherwise."/>
			<outline text="***Wall Street Journal Checks In"/>
			<outline text="I was aware that Lee Gomes of the Wall Street Journal was working on the story of Microsoft's efforts to boost the Macintosh net developer community. I saw him doing his work at an Expo party, but he asked that I kick back and let him do his thing. &quot;You have a shorter lead-time than me,&quot; he said. &quot;True, but I've already written this story,&quot; I said. &quot;Many times,&quot; I thought to myself."/>
			<outline text="The article is in today's Journal. It's great! &quot;Microsoft Corp. has launched a quiet but ambitious effort to help small software companies write Internet programs for its struggling rival, Apple Computer Inc.&quot; says the Journal."/>
			<outline text="I support what Microsoft is doing. If Apple decides to provide meaningful support for net developers I'd welcome it too. Same with Netscape and any other investor with deep pockets and an interest in the Net. "/>
			<outline text="There are bargains to be had in this community. We're deep on great technology that wants to happen. OpenDoc may be relevent in 1998, if Apple survives 1997. Today's Mac technologists want to hit home runs with stuff that's already working and supported in the app base. No new software needed, just the will to succeed and a little money. Where else can you buy that so cheaply? Nowhere. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is smart. We keep learning that lesson. It's coool! Many thanks to Don Bradford, donbrad@microsoft.com, and his chain of command, for believing in us. One developer says he feels like he's making a deal with the devil. How ironic. Microsoft is much less the devil than Apple is, even though Apple's rep is cleaner; but this is undeserved. As has been amply reported in DaveNet, Apple screws developers routinely. With rare exceptions, they've been doing it since 1980. And they still do it, at a time when they need the goodwill of developers more than ever."/>
			<outline text="In the Journal piece, Ellen Hancock, Apple's CTO, complains that it's not fair. To Ms. Hancock, with much respect, start treating your developers like the accomplished hardworking professionals they are, and you'll find that you can have an important place in this community too."/>
			<outline text="I am always disappointed when Apple choses to compete with developers, especially in diverse markets like web servers and web content tools. Apple is anti-diversity, when they move into a market, the developers go out of business. We've been around this loop so many times. Ms. Hancock may not know, because she's new at Apple. It doesn't matter if she gets it or not. Apple keeps betting on the wrong people, on a super-expensive R&amp;D system that produces little timely or useful software. "/>
			<outline text="Same old same old. Apple remembers too much. They can't compete with Microsoft, yet they keep trying. They have to let go of that one before they can move on."/>
			<outline text="We aren't waiting for Apple. Cooool. Many thanks to Microsoft for helping to make that possible."/>
			<outline text="***BeOS"/>
			<outline text="Another company that believes in the power of the Macintosh community is Jean-Louis Gassee's Be Inc. I reported, briefly, in the last piece that they had ported the BeOS to Macintosh hardware. I saw it! It sets my mind spinning. What if... What if! I love this."/>
			<outline text="Could the BeOS run Macintosh applications? If so, let's call it System 8 and be done with it. A modern OS that supports multiple processors. An emphasis on fast storage and multimedia. A natural fit for Mac web developers. What a great web server the BeOS would make. What a natural leader Jean-Louis would make. "/>
			<outline text="To other developers, keep your mind and options open. Make a deal with Apple today with your eyes open. There are other possibilities. Let your mind play with this one."/>
			<outline text="All the mottos apply. Let's have fun! Still diggin... Go with the flow. Gambatte. Ye-ha. I'd add a new one, it comes from Winston Churchill, I think (I'll be corrected, for sure)... &quot;We must all hang together or we'll all hang separately.&quot; Maybe it was Patrick Henry?"/>
			<outline text="Seeya later!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Chuck Shotton, cshotton@biap.com, asked me to tell people that his server at ww.biap.com is off the air due to an electrical storm in Houston. This means that the MIDAS mailing list is off the air too."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Before It Gets Too Hot&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/13/96; 9:58:01 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="This has to be a quick one. I've got a bunch of work to do today before it gets hot. Man. Yesterday was a scorcher. Today will be too. So I'll write quickly."/>
			<outline text="***I actually laugh when I write these things"/>
			<outline text="A few people, following up after meeting me in person at MacWorld Expo, remarked that I don't talk like I write. Wrong! I talk exactly like I write. Sometimes I even talk out loud while I write. Sometimes very loudly! I learned this when I tried to write a DaveNet piece on the plane to Boston last week. It doesn't work. People want to know what that man thinks is so funny! So if you can't hear me laughing while I write these pieces, then you're hearing someone else's voice, not mine."/>
			<outline text="Some people assume I'm writing about AppleScript when I write about Apple putting developers out of business. I am not. That's a long-gone struggle. I forgave them and moved on. I did it publicly, in &quot;Let's Have Fun!&quot;, 4/26/96, a week before my fortieth birthday. Before you question my intent re AppleScript, I ask that you read that piece. It was a milestone for me, and unless you understand what I'm saying in that piece, you can't understand my position on AppleScript. Then read &quot;We Love AppleScript!&quot; for proof that the words now have actions behind them."/>
			<outline text="Further, if Apple is kind to Frontier and its developers and users they need never be an obstacle to the growth of its market. Maybe someday we'll be able to get a business going around Frontier on the Mac. I'm hopeful. But my eyes are open too."/>
			<outline text="***It's happening right now"/>
			<outline text="No, the latest victim of Apple's fear is the strongest standard we have in the Mac web market, Quarterdeck's WebStar web server product. There's a community here that's being undermined. It's happening right now. And it's not too late to stop it, so that's why it's a good idea to discuss this now."/>
			<outline text="The Mac web server community looks to Chuck Shotton, cshotton@biap.com, WebStar's chief developer, for leadership. His leadership is a demonstrable fact. Chuck's not perfect, but he is responsive. A competitive market is developing in web servers, with some excellent entries from ResNova and others. We're ready to go to the next stage of maturity in this market. But Apple is planning to bundle a server from Maxum, a fine company with an excellent reputation. But Maxum is not the leader in this market. Don't be misled, Apple cannot be just another vendor in this market. Their move divides the market, undermines Chuck's leadership, but more importantly, it undermines the standard, and our ability to move it forward quickly."/>
			<outline text="It would be hypocritical for me to stand by and say nothing. I hated being out there on my own when Apple chose to take over my market. Now, one more time round the loop, they've found a developer who will give them what they want at the expense of the community. "/>
			<outline text="That's why I quoted Benjamin Franklin (not Winston Churchill or Patrick Henry) -- &quot;We must all hang together or we will all hang separately.&quot; To other developers, make your deals with Apple, but be aware that you'll lose some of your trust with other developers."/>
			<outline text="I stand for independence and choice and diversity. Did you hear Colin Powell's speech at the Republican convention last night? He's in favor of affirmative action and is pro-choice. He got a standing ovation! Hey if the Republicans can handle diversity, why can't the Macintosh market?"/>
			<outline text="And I don't hate OpenDoc! -- but I do dislike it when people say I do. I choose not to invest in OpenDoc at this time. It's my money, not yours. I could be wrong about OpenDoc. It's happened before."/>
			<outline text="The best solution, when in doubt, is to read the words. Listening is hard work. Inference and assumption are dangerous things to do. Please take people at face value, including me. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft is not the platform vendor in the Mac market"/>
			<outline text="I support Microsoft's presence in the Mac market, without any qualification. I do this with my eyes open. There's no point sending me email explaining Microsoft's track record in the Windows and DOS markets. This is the Mac market. They are not the platform vendor here. They don't control what's bundled with the operating system. Listening to Microsoft people, I can hear how much they want to work with Apple, and how much it hurts them, on a personal level, when Apple blows them off."/>
			<outline text="An Apple evangelist asks: &quot;How would you characterize what Microsoft is doing to Netscape? Netscape makes money selling web browsers and web servers. So Microsoft gives browsers and servers away. How is this different?&quot; I respond: &quot;OK. Microsoft is mean to Netscape. So what? I'm not talking about who's nicer than who. It's about winning. Apple loses too when it wipes out growing markets. That's the real point.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Or if you don't like the pragmatic approach, try the moral one. Two wrongs don't make a right. "/>
			<outline text="***Wall Street Journal, revisited"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I liked yesterday's Wall Street Journal article because for the first time, a major business publication considered the possibility that new software that makes the Mac a healthier platform can come from developers other than Apple. Finally! "/>
			<outline text="Now it's time to roll up our sleeves and deliver the software that connects to what Microsoft is doing. Microsoft welcomes us, they don't tell us to go away. We respond by getting closer. This is business. It's the right way to do it."/>
			<outline text="I think the Journal got a lot of things right. Here's an example: &quot;Microsoft is hoping that the innovative tradition of small Mac programmers will create exciting Internet programs that will keep people attracted to the Mac.&quot; Right on!"/>
			<outline text="The Journal also reported that the new Microsoft group is building Mac-specific code. That's also true, and very important. Mac users deserve the best we can create, Microsoft is saying. This stands in sharp contrast to other developers (including, ironically, other parts of Microsoft) who view the Mac as a porting opportunity. The more developers that create software specifically for the Mac, the more reasons there will be to use a Mac. Microsoft has chosen to zig and zag at the same time, to cover both bets -- thru ported apps and thru native apps. They're big enough to do that."/>
			<outline text="But, a couple of things need to be cleared up. I can help with one, but the other one has to come from Microsoft. The Journal says &quot;[Microsoft] has told Macintosh software companies that it stands ready to help them in numerous ways, possibly including no-strings-attached cash grants of as much as $100,000.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I think this is wrong. No strings? That's not the way business works. It would be great if it did; as long as I got the free money, and not my competitor. If it were happening I think I would know. I don't see it. "/>
			<outline text="The Journal theorizes that Microsoft is investing in the Mac market to avoid the scrutiny of US government's anti-trust attorneys. Maybe so. We all have our theories why Microsoft is here. But Microsoft has no statement I can refer you to. So here's an invitation to Bill Gates, Brad Silverberg, John Ludwig or Don Bradford at Microsoft. Why are you investing in the Mac platform? What are your hopes? What role would you like to play? If Microsoft will issue a statement, I'd be happy to run it in DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="And to other technology leaders -- what are you willing to do to assure that there's a healthy climate for small Macintosh developers with big ideas?"/>
			<outline text="***About Power Computing's laptop"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I asked where Power Computing's laptop is."/>
			<outline text="The answer came from Marc Gonzales, markg@be.com: &quot;I was at the Mac clone panel on Wednesday when this issue came up. As  you know, Apple's clone strategy currently depends upon Apple licensing  their hardware designs and chip sets out to the clone vendors - mainly because the MacOS cannot be separated, currently, from the underlying custom hardware."/>
			<outline text="&quot;In the case of PowerBooks, the issue is even worse, with the hardware and software being extremely intertwined. The Apple fellow on the panel confirmed this and said it was a major problem they are trying to work on. Power Computing, for their part, made a public plea for Apple to hurry up already, and this was seconded by the other members of  the panel."/>
			<outline text="&quot;So, it's not really Power's fault - they're waiting for Apple. And they  can't base a portable platform upon CHRP because they're waiting for Apple to ship a MacOS version for CHRP. So they're stuck right now. They really want to do it, but can't.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***The DaveNet BBS"/>
			<outline text="There's a new web-based bulletin-board system for DaveNet readers (and Frontier users) to comment on pieces, read other people's replies and to comment on them. "/>
			<outline text="The URL is http://www.scripting.com/bbs.welcome.fcgi. Help me get the ball rolling. If you have a comment, please log onto the BBS, jump to the DaveNet section, and enter your comments. Other DaveNet readers will read them, and a discussion can happen. It'll be fun!"/>
			<outline text="***A Hot New Company"/>
			<outline text="Have you heard about Marimba Inc? I've been following this company since its inception; I first wrote about them in &quot;Web Energy&quot;, 1/26/96, before they had a name or an office or a payroll. Marimba is the group that split off from Sun to do Java-based software for net applications. I want their Mac software to shine. To do this, they need to get the very best Mac people. They're hiring now. If you have deep MacOS experience, and want to win, it could be a win for you too."/>

We don't have any more complex goals than this. We just want to provide the fastest, smallest, most functional, most robust Mac Internet software possible. We want to integrate with other Mac software well so that Mac users have a great experience. We think we have achieved these goals with Mac Internet Explorer 2.0;  we think we will start to pull away from the pack with Internet Explorer 3.0 for the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="As for some of the allegations about our motives in the Wall Street Journal, they are completely unfounded. We don't spend time thinking about Mac marketshare; Mac marketshare is Apple's issue to wrestle with, we don't believe that Mac Internet Explorer has any significant impact one way or another. We don't offer payments to ISVs to work with us as a regular practice. Like every company, on occasion we will have strategic business relationships with a selected few number of partners, and sometimes cash payments will be a part of these relationships, but this is the exception, not the rule. "/>
			<outline text="We do intend to work with partners broadly in the Mac software marketplace just as we do in the Windows marketplace. We know that our software is more valuable when it interoperates well with the large variety of other solutions out there, we will continue to invest in working relationships with all the players in the Mac software marketplace. "/>
			<outline text="I hope this clarifies our goals. To reiterate -- our goal is to provide the best Mac Internet browser product on the market, supporting our overall goal to be a leading vendor of Internet software. "/>

			<outline text="Irma Thomas is a famous New Orleans R&amp;B singer. "/>
			<outline text="I first heard Irma sing about the smoke filled room when I was an undergrad in New Orleans in the 70s. I was a very young man. She made a huge impression. Her eyes so clear so intense so totally honest. Her voice so clear, she looked right at me, and got right in there, into a spot I didn't know I had. "/>
			<outline text="She comes into a smoke filled room and suddenly she's face to face with her old lover. She feels a flood of emotion, like a wave, it rolled on thru. It takes her back to yesterday, when love was all she had for him. It was good enough she thought, good enough for him. "/>
			<outline text="The smoke burns her eyes, it's like the rain from a troubled sky, but she isn't crying over him. Tears from a smoke filled room. "/>
			<outline text="He's locked in another girl's embrace. She can see the way she looks at him. She knows the feeling because she used to be in her place. She's tough. She can stand the pain. She's choking, but it's not from some old flame. No, it's just the smoke filled room. "/>
			<outline text="Hmmm. Soulful. This is the ideal, what a woman should be. Tall and proud. Clear as a bell. Strong but vulnerable. "/>
			<outline text="Here's to you Irma, where ever you may be. Today you're on my mind and on my sound system, and I'm singing right along. "/>
			<outline text="So is the world."/>
			<outline text="Read on..."/>
			<outline text="***Mark your calendars"/>
			<outline text="Mark the week of August 5, 1996 on your calendars. It's when the business press re-discovered the independent developers of the Macintosh platform. A dozen calls from business reporters at all kinds of pubs. They're listening respectfully. Asking followup questions that reiterate the premise. We're in agreement. This is different. In the past, talking to reporters, I'd always have to argue with their premise. &quot;Why are you paying so much attention to Apple?&quot; I'd ask."/>
			<outline text="I wail to no avail. People only hear what they want to hear. What they're expecting. They want to hear that Apple is dead, and they want to take the Mac down with it. "/>
			<outline text="Well, the world has changed, we've grown, you just watch. This piece will resonate. They'll pass it on. You'll remember this one. The world is coming together right!"/>
			<outline text="Many thanks to Lee Gomes of the Wall Street Journal and Don Bradford of Microsoft. Each of them became a lightning rod this week. Soon I hope the controversy will settle down and people will remember that cool stuff is happening on the Mac. That's the real message. Microsoft's role is clear. They make some of that stuff. "/>
			<outline text="And Bradford is a good man, his heart is in the right place, but he got caught with his foot in his mouth. That's the truth. Life goes on. Still diggin!"/>
			<outline text="***Win-wins"/>
			<outline text="People ask, again and again, if Microsoft is buying the loyalty of Mac developers. No. I thought some more about this. It's not necessary, and in my case, at least, it's not possible. I'm only into win-wins. So many wins are possible. So why leave value on the table? I want more than money. "/>
			<outline text="Let's share the bounty! Instead of eating seed corn, let's grow a great crop of new standards built on the ones we have. It'll be a love festival, you'll see. All we need is to believe. Apple should be encouraged to commercialize and improve their own technology, and stay out of markets they didn't create and don't participate in. "/>
			<outline text="On the Semper-Fi mailing list people are talking about Apple Internet Graphics -- a hypothetical cross-platform implementation of QuickDraw GX. This idea is interesting. Vector graphics instead of bitmaps. Low bandwidth! Cooool. "/>
			<outline text="So, everyone, Apple included, let's stop crying over lost love! It's just a smoke filled room. Look forward. Let's create new love."/>

		<outline text="Diggin The Times" created="8/19/1996;  8:24:50 AM" name="digginTheTimes" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Diggin The Times&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/19/96; 8:24:50 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I like to read the New York Times. It's a great paper. They cover the world. Now they're running a contest. Remember their print slogan? All The News That's Fit To Print. It's a beautiful reminder, there's judgement in there. But now a days that's an anachronism because the news isn't printed all the time. They want a new slogan. All The News That Fits on their Website. Nahhh. Dig we must! "/>
			<outline text="The Times is great for following the stories of our day. I read about the Unabomber on a daily basis a few months back. A new article appeared on page 1 every day as more was learned of the lifestyle and philosophy of the bomber. I made a point of reading every article from top to bottom. I decided to be informed, and the Times made it possible."/>
			<outline text="I found that there was a lot to admire in the philosophy of the bomber. I was flying into Salt Lake City, reading one of the pieces. Looking out the plane window I could see the impact of man everywhere. Large dayglo colored swatches of water-covered land, in neat modules with roads separating them. A city on the edge of a mountain range. A mountain with a big chunk missing. Kaczynski's message was that this style of humanity wasn't right. I could see his point."/>
			<outline text="Of course it's not cool to kill other people as way to call attention to your argument. So the Unabomber story may have made good reading, but his tactics were not supportable. That made the story even more interesting. Life and death. I like drama, and the Times captured it. Great writing around a great story that unfolded on a daily basis. That's what being a great newspaper is all about."/>
			<outline text="Lately, I've been doing the same with the TWA flight 800 tragedy. After the plane went down I got my Times and read. Every day. It's still on page one. A painstaking process. The investigators haven't got a theory yet, but they've eliminated many possible theories. They're investigating the destroyed plane, the destroyed bodies and the destroyed lives. There's humanity all over the story. The news is a process. Tomorrow there will be another story. All the news that's fit to print. That's what they do. A perfect example."/>
			<outline text="So, as the Times moves into the electronic era, of 10-minute leadtimes, and cumulative pages -- today's Times is a dynamic website behind a password. A bit of holding onto the past. They'll look back 100 years from now and laugh at that little password buggy whip, it's so against the philosophy of the web. Information needs to be connected, to be presented in context. My writing is important even if it isn't part of the Times. They link out of their site, but it is impossible to link into theirs. This goes against the grain of the web. They're holding onto an idea that's obsolete."/>
			<outline text="You can't make a profit off the print press now that we don't need it anymore. The 50 cents they get for the print edition is still a cash cow. But ten years from now it may not be. Certainly not 100 years from now. How many generations will have passed? Will we still be reading the news on processed dead trees? No, I don't think we will."/>
			<outline text="The Times is great because it can afford a 100-year perspective. If the world still exists 100 years from now, it's a pretty safe bet the Times will exist too. But whatever slogan they come up with now is sure to be meaningless in a few years. The web is going to change our expectations. It may feel like it's getting mature, but we're just at a resting point. All our cards will get tossed in the air again. The price of progress. "/>
			<outline text="New kinds of elitism, power flows differently in this medium, we expect more from our news sources, and they'll deliver. It'll be a process of revolution and refinement, over and over, possibly for the rest of our lives. Hopefully! The medium is the message. Who said that? Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="So my vote, as of 8/19/96, is &quot;Still Diggin!&quot; Keep the contest open for a few years. That would be the best testimony to the true nature of the web."/>
			<outline text="***FileMaker"/>
			<outline text="FileMaker, from Claris Corp, is a very popular and inexpensive piece of software. I bought a copy at a local computer store for $99. It's incredible what you get for so little money. It's a fast programmable relational database, it's easy and friendly, has a great user interface builder, and is popular and well-tested. It's safe, it's cross-platform, with excellent versions available for Macintosh and Windows 95."/>
			<outline text="People have been building on FileMaker. Check out the searching function at http://www.scripting.com/search.html. What's running behind that page? A set of scripts, written by a company called BlueWorld, that manages an index in a FileMaker database. Every night at 2AM an agent runs, checking all the new or newly modified files and indexing or re-indexing them. "/>
			<outline text="I can put more stuff on my website, and expect that people will be able to find it when they need the info. Recently I put Frontier's sample scripts on the web at http://www.scripting.com/samples/. It makes for good browsing, but the real reason I put them there is so that the search function would find them. Now, when a script writer looks up a verb, like file.putFileDialog, for example, they not only get a page describing the verb, they also get a sample script that uses the verb."/>
			<outline text="Coupled with the Find command in your web browser, you can quickly locate all the information you need to solve a problem. As my website grows towards 3000 pages, this is becoming more and more necessary. The search engines, Alta Vista, Lycos, Web Crawler et al, don't visit my site often enough. And they aren't selective enough. Each site needs its own index. And FileMaker makes an excellent choice for indexing Mac websites. With some new technology, the same thing could work on Windows too."/>
			<outline text="***Claris"/>
			<outline text="I wonder if the people at Claris are aware of how important their product has become? I wonder because the interface connecting FileMaker to the outside world is old and complicated and unnecessarily slow. With a new visit, in the context of the web and net-based script writers, a new interface could quickly be put together that improves performance and usability by an order of magnitude."/>
			<outline text="This is even more important, as we look to exporting app-level scripting technology to other platforms, because FileMaker is a cross-platform product. We recently used its cross-platform feature in a project we're doing for a leading venture capital firm. The people at the office use Windows machines, but the server is running on a Mac. Not a problem. The office people do data entry on their PCs, shoot the database over to the Mac server, and the new information is deployed on the web. "/>
			<outline text="This is the kind of synergy we're always looking for! The client is happy, and we get to do CGIs as scripts instead of having to write our own database software, and we can use the database that users like to use. Everyone is happy. Thank you FileMaker, for existing, and being scriptable. It's coool."/>
			<outline text="Lots of Filemaker data is being served on the web. It could be faster. With the proper focus, care, and community-building efforts it could easily be as important as Netscape and Microsoft's server products. Seems like that would be worth the investment."/>
			<outline text="With all my respect, I encourage the people at Claris to join up with the Macintosh Internet Developer Association (MIDAS) at http://www.biap.com/midas/ and let's get busy making FileMaker the technology leader that it was meant to be."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft's Internet Services Library"/>
			<outline text="An important story in this week's MacWEEK, on the web at http://www.macweek.com/mw_1032/news_microsoft.html. Microsoft is releasing a shared library of Internet services that will be accessible from C and Java code and from scripts running in Frontier. This is the beginning of something important. We'll be able to do much more from scripts real soon now. "/>
			<outline text="***The best mail system possible"/>
			<outline text="Lots of smart people are thinking about new mail software. I'm ready for it, with hundreds of messages coming in every day, and dozens going out. My conventional emailer is out of gas. No fault. It was never designed to handle the kind of load I'm pushing thru it."/>
			<outline text="I want multiple indexes, cleverly sorted so that I can see all messages pertaining to a specific subject, or from a particular person, or any combination of attributes. An efficient storage system so that messages are only stored once, and not using the inefficient blocking strategy that the Mac file system uses (a one-sentence email message takes up 16K on my disk). The Mac file system was never designed for this kind of load either. "/>
			<outline text="I also want to be able to search my back-email as I would search the web using a search engine like Alta Vista. The new mail for each day is indexed at 2AM while I'm sleeping. This fits my workstyle. Yesterday's messages are indexed in the database, today's messages are presented in a structure of filtered outlines. The ones I need indexing for are the ones I wrote two months ago. I remember who I sent it to, or can think of a keyword, but can't easily navigate to it thru the outline structure."/>
			<outline text="One more big feature -- I want the option of flowing any number of outlines to a website so other people can access them. The rendering for these pages should be done at 2AM too."/>
			<outline text="The key is to reorganize the power of today's machines so they are more effective at serving the needs of intense email users like me, and maybe you too. I'm still digging on this one. Hope to have a release soon."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Another reason for Claris to work with MIDAS -- the open protocols that allow archival and organization of email text are supported by Eudora, but not by Claris Emailer. It's important to get these protocols supported by all popular email clients. It's easy technology with a strong marketing angle. There's a standard. It needs to be supported. Nuf said. (Hopefully!)"/>

			<outline text="***Give your body happiness"/>
			<outline text="I heard this song on the radio a couple of days ago and it's been haunting me since. It's kind of an old corny song, but it's sexy too. Very sexy! It seemed to be about a girl, Magdalena or something like that. I forgot the name but I remembered the sexiness. The song made me giddy!"/>
			<outline text="I learned a long time ago, when Deborah Norville did the early morning news on NBC, there's nothing sexier than a smart female with a clever smile surrounded by old corny males that are in love with her. That's what this song was about. The old guys become coool because they love such a wonderful woman. What *was* her name? Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="Well, happy ending -- I found the song! I was just browsing the CNN website, they had a story entitled &quot;U.S. hears the beat of macarena dance craze.&quot; I checked it out. The picture is of a couple of corny looking Spanish guys clapping their hands and some 60s looking go-go like dancers. It looked promising. They have music. Here's the URL:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9608/22/macarena/ "/>
			<outline text="That's it! Macarena macarena macarena. Ohhhh macarena. Now I just have to find the CD. I know what song I'll be listening to next week. Over and over and over."/>
			<outline text="According to CNN, Diana Patricia, the Venezuelan flamenco dancer who inspired the song, says &quot;They asked me to dance and when I went on the stage, they began to sing, 'Give your body happiness, macarena.'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Uh huh!"/>
			<outline text="I can't wait."/>
			<outline text="***Java in Question"/>
			<outline text="Hey my neck is tight. I must be shipping software. Or is it something else?"/>
			<outline text="Last week was Browser Wars week in the business press. Microsoft is asking people to look at Internet Explorer as everything Netscape is and more. Well, on the PC perhaps, but not yet on the Mac. There's still only one way to get Java on web pages on a Mac -- Netscape."/>
			<outline text="But we're learning that clean design counts. Microsoft's browser has a cleaner look than Netscape. They both crash a lot. I don't know about the PC versions. "/>
			<outline text="I want Netscape to win. I remember what it was like before the web happened. I don't want to go back to the world where everything must wait for Microsoft. Where no company dares grow large enough to show up in their sights. Where no investor will buy into a business plan that could be competitive with Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="So that's why the new Java Fund, capitalized at $100 million and managed by venture capitalist Kleiner Perkins, is good news. I've learned a lot and grown a lot since I wrote &quot;Bill Gates vs The Internet&quot;, back in 1994, where they weren't just VCs, they were greedy VCs. They didn't like that. OK. I've become more comfortable with the role these people can play in moving technology forward. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="Java may be a dream-come-true for venture capitalists. They want to create a new wave of IPOs, maybe next summer, for companies that build on Java as their platform. "/>
			<outline text="***Is Java really cross-platform?"/>
			<outline text="Java's strategy is to create a community that builds software that doesn't care if it's running on a Windows machine or a Mac or something else. Just like the web; it worked once, Java is saying, why can't it work again? So you aren't an Apple developer, or a Microsoft developer, you're a Java developer and you go where ever Java takes you."/>
			<outline text="The mother ship is Kleiner Perkins and the association of companies they created. They're supported by IBM, Sun and Netscape and others. They create warmth, developers create software, Microsoft doesn't run the show; Apple doesn't run it into the ground, and the world is safe for startups."/>
			<outline text="But there's a problem! (Of course.)"/>
			<outline text="Right now, the Java operating environment is very spartan. People may be fixing that, but if so, they're doing it for Windows not Mac. Uh oh. You can't make commercial quality Java code that runs cross-platform. What? I thought that was the advantage Java was supposed to offer. Wait. I'd expect by now that Kleiner, if they're really serious about Java, they would have funded a new company to do a really great implementation of Java for the Macintosh. Maybe I missed something? But I don't think so..."/>
			<outline text="Java is an end-run around Microsoft. But it's missing the piece that makes the end-run possible. Oooops. Should we fix it or wait? "/>
			<outline text="***I hate to wait"/>
			<outline text="I've been on everyone's case, Microsoft, Metrowerks, Natural Intelligence, Sun, Apple, to hurry up and ship a great Java implementation on the Mac. It's not enough that Java runs inside a web browser. It has to run from other environments. We have five implementations to choose from, but so far, none of them have given us a pitch that makes sense."/>
			<outline text="And no one, except Sun, has even shipped a Java implementation that can run apps outside of a web browser. I can't do a lot of building on Sun's stuff, there aren't enough hooks to do it. We have a very simple connection working, but it's nothing to get excited about. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/goodies/java.html "/>
			<outline text="I know that Java is in my future. I'm ready to bet big on it. I want Netscape to win. I want to win too. I've got an environment that would be nirvana for Java developers, if only we could get started. Wait wait wait. I hate to wait! It isn't my nature. Let's go! Come on gals and guys, you'll see we'll have fun."/>
			<outline text="I can't wait, so we're doing a new release of Frontier, digging into email the same way we dug into web content development. Cleaning up the APIs for our database. Creating new open architectures in anticipation of the arrival of our cousins, the Java apps, the ones created by the Java Fund companies. "/>
			<outline text="I can't wait so I'm doing something that may shock some DaveNet readers."/>
			<outline text="***Read this twice"/>
			<outline text="We'll ship a new version of Frontier sometime next month. This will be the last version that only runs on the Mac OS. "/>
			<outline text="The next version, 5.0, will ship on both the Mac and for Windows. "/>
			<outline text="You can expect a different tune from me in the future. I'm energized by being able to think in terms of both platforms. I was a PC developer once. I'm going there again. Hey a lot has changed, but a lot hasn't!"/>
			<outline text="Soon it may be my primary computer. I'm open to the idea. I want to run a Windows-based server. Do content on Windows. I want to experience this world, so I will. Gotta have my tools. It'll make these DaveNets more interesting. I'm not saying goodbye to the Mac, but I am saying hello to Windows. I'm looking forward to it."/>
			<outline text="Bob Bierman, bierman@pacbell.net, is working on our Windows software. He and I and Doug Baron worked together at Living Videotext in the mid-80s.

			<outline text="#title &quot;Happy Saturday&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/24/96; 10:30:01 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="It's a quiet Saturday, I have a bunch of details to get out of the way and I want to point you to an interesting new website."/>
			<outline text="***Correction: Apple has shipped a Java Runtime"/>
			<outline text="I made a mistake in yesterday's DaveNet, &quot;Macarena!&quot;, when I said that only Sun's Runtime could run standalone Java apps on the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="I didn't know that Apple had shipped a beta of their Java Runtime. It's available at http://www.devtools.apple.com/mrj/. "/>
			<outline text="My apologies to Apple for not being aware that they had shipped this. I'll be checking it out and reporting on its capabilities."/>
			<outline text="***Correction: Kaczynski is accused"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Diggin The Times&quot;, 8/19/96, I made a beginner's mistake -- I referred to Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber, but this isn't fair. In the US legal system you are innocent until proven guilty. So the only statement I can make, or anyone else for that matter, is that Kaczynski is accused of being the Unabomber. It hasn't been proven. This is an important distinction."/>
			<outline text="We're no closer to knowing how TWA 800 was destroyed. A conclusion (a bomb!) made the front page of the Times yesterday, with a major headline, but today the investigators have said that they still don't know how it happened."/>
			<outline text="***Good vibes on going to Windows"/>
			<outline text="I've gotten a lot of thanks and congratulations for deciding to invest in moving our web and net tools to Windows. Most came from people who are already using our Mac stuff, who believe it will be easier, politically, to deploy and build on our stuff if a Windows version is available. "/>
			<outline text="I was also pleased with the reception from members of the PC press. What a difference! It's true that Microsoft plays in some of the areas we will be entering, but it also seems that the Windows market is more open to stuff coming from others. "/>
			<outline text="People may claim that Microsoft is a more aggressive competitor (Apple is pretty aggressive!), but the market may have corrected for that better in the Windows world. "/>
			<outline text="I heard from a bunch of the troops, but heard nothing from execs of either Microsoft or Apple. Here's an interesting common ground for these two companies to collaborate. I offer Frontier as a place where their worlds can meet and connect. A cross-platform Frontier could be a very interesting place. Both Apple and Microsoft could help this happen. I'll work with anyone as long as we can win."/>
			<outline text="***Wanting Netscape to Win"/>
			<outline text="Another clarification -- I said in yesterday's piece that I wanted Netscape to win. I said it twice. This doesn't mean that I want Microsoft to lose. Let's look for win-wins. I hope there is a way for us to have both Microsoft and Netscape making contributions to the web world. I believe a balance serves the interests of developers and users. "/>
			<outline text="With $7 billion in the bank, it's pretty clear that Microsoft isn't going away anytime soon. But Netscape isn't as strong. If you value independence, I think you have to want Netscape to be present in this market for the forseeable future. My opinion, of course."/>
			<outline text="***A question from Gates"/>
			<outline text="As this piece was going to press (so to speak) I got an email from Bill Gates, billg@microsoft.com. He said &quot;I think the readers of your electronic newsletter would be interested to know a little bit about the other subscribers - how many are there? How has that changed over time? What kind of people are reading? Do a lot send you feedback?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Quickly, with more details to come later, the number of readers varies widely.  Some pieces travel much further than others, are picked up by other mailing lists. For example, &quot;The Compaq of ISPs&quot; went *very* far, I could tell, because the responses were very diverse. It hit a nerve."/>
			<outline text="There's a list server at www.hotwired.com that people can subscribe to. The HotWired folks have been very kind in letting me continue to use that server, even though I no longer write for them."/>
			<outline text="I get a lot of email. Some pieces more than others. Until my &quot;BBS&quot; went on the air, I was forwarding the most interesting comments to the &quot;DaveNet Mail&quot; website. I think I'll start doing that again. There are some interesting messages in that site. The BBS is starting to catch on too. I hope people take advantage. DaveNet is now two-way. Please give it a look, and don't be afraid to say something."/>
			<outline text="One more thing, the combination of email and the web is very powerful. I see lots of other software providers moving in this direction. I could see how well these things worked a couple of years ago. I'm going to keep moving, trying out new technology, and doing a few new websites, extending out from where DaveNet is now. Still diggin! (And having fun.)"/>
			<outline text="Finally, I see DaveNet as a combination of software and opinion. Both aspects drive each other. No time to write more about this, at this time..."/>
			<outline text="***The sucksters strike again"/>
			<outline text="A new interesting website from the people who brought you www.suck.com. It's at http://www.placing.com/. Think of it as interactive suck. What does the name mean? Win, place and show. "/>
			<outline text="The products and ideas they showcase aren't the winners. To be at placing.com, you just have to place. OK. It's funny! (Of course.) They're cynics, that's OK. It's interesting, I plan to watch it, maybe even contribute a limerick or too."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/28/96; 7:42:19 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It's bee season here in California. "/>
			<outline text="I sit on the patio by the pool, the usual routine, coffee, a newspaper, music, bees. Look at the trees and swat them away. They're yellowjackets, they don't sting, but they sure are annoying."/>
			<outline text="The first summer here the humans gave in to the bees. We stayed indoors in bee season. I didn't know how to fight back. Now, four summers into living here, the bees are almost under control. The key -- bee traps."/>
			<outline text="I hang several yellow plastic cylinders from trees and bushes or hooks on the side of the house. There are three tiny entrances to each trap on the bottom. They lead up a funnel into a larger chamber that can hold hundreds of bees. It's a one-way trip, bees go in but don't come out. "/>
			<outline text="To lure them into the trap you spread a sticky awful-smelling mixture onto a cotton wad and put it into the trap. Bees love the smell of this stuff. Be careful not to get any on yourself, it doesn't wash off easily, and for the next few hours you'll attract the bees, even indoors. Uck! Been there, done that."/>
			<outline text="I wonder if the bees are philosophical about their condition in the last minutes of life. I wonder what words they have to describe the dilemma. I wonder if mothers and sisters are in there; brothers and fathers. Do they mourn the passing of their friends and family? Do they have bee priests and doctors to provide spiritual context, or to shrug their shoulders and say that nothing can be done?"/>
			<outline text="And how close to the truth could they possibly get when they ask the question we all want to know the answer to: Why? &quot;Why do we live and why am I dying?&quot; the bee could ask in his or her final reflections. I can't answer the first question, but I know the answer to the second one. I kill bees so I can enjoy a nice August afternoon in peace. "/>
			<outline text="We die a thousand deaths in this life. Sometimes I think that all art comes from grief -- the mourning of our own deaths. All victories, attempted ones too, are a denial of our mortality. Anger is our wish to live forever. Love is our knowledge that life is greater than it may seem. "/>
			<outline text="On down days, I see our planet as a huge bee trap for humanity. Nowhere to go from here. Enjoy the ride the best you can, knowing that it's sure to end sooner than we'd like. "/>
			<outline text="Can we know why we live? No, I don't think so. I think the answer is there, but the terminology and context would be totally foreign to us. We can't understand because we are not beings that understand. At our best, we love and create and enjoy. But we remain clueless to our purpose."/>
			<outline text="I remind myself that I kill bees so I can enjoy a nice August afternoon in peace. I wonder what being I please or not. Who created me and why? When my body feels weak I wonder if some higher being is enjoying his August afternoon at my expense. "/>
			<outline text="I get a phone call from a reporter, but I don't take it. He wants to know why Mac developers are moving to Windows. Why? Why? "/>

Probably the most exciting part was riding the roller coaster. My neck is loose now. Thanks! And thanks to Marc Canter, and his friends, the Preacher Boy band, for the great entertainment. "/>

			<outline text="***Bee Stories"/>
			<outline text="I heard more about bees after my last piece, &quot;Bee Season&quot;, 8/28/96. "/>
			<outline text="From Kevin Compton, kcompton@attmail.com, a publicist at AT&amp;T: &quot;Dave, I wouldn't worry about the bees; they're such socialists. I saw a frightening documentary on insects while in college (71ish), where ants would march in a line, get to a stream, and form an ant-bridge with their bodies for the others to walk across (drowning in the process, of course).  I still recall the horror of the closeup where an ant would sink, and another would step right into its place.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="From Dave Carlick, dsc@poppe.com, an ad man at Poppe-Tyson: &quot;David, plant some rosemary, lots of rosemary, in a sunny spot not too close to your patio. The bees will hang around there, favoring rosemary over most any patio comestible, and you won't need to grapple with the meaning of life, leaving you more time to read the paper, write your writings, and nurture the press.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I also learned that yellowjackets are not bees, they're wasps. And people say that they do sting, but, as I reported, I've never been bit."/>
			<outline text="***Frontier &amp; Windows"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Macarena!&quot;, 8/23/96, I reported that we're moving our web development tools and server operating system to Windows 95 and Windows NT. Reports are starting to come out in the trade press, and while accurate, they're leading some people to conclude that we're abandoning the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="It's not true. We're working on Frontier 4.1, a new release with major new features that will only be available on the Mac. At the same time, the core technology underneath Frontier, the object database, is being ported to Windows. From there, we are thinking seriously about other platforms."/>
			<outline text="But for the forseeable future (i.e. the future I can see) the Mac platform is our home base. The Mac version of Frontier will be the most powerful version because the Mac OS has a broader scripting culture than any other platform. We'll work to develop the culture on other platforms, but it will take time."/>
			<outline text="In the sometimes perverse world of software logic, our support for Windows may actually help the Mac/Frontier combo, because it makes the Mac a more acceptable web content tool. A Windows version is a growth opportunity for my company, but it's also a safety net for people who build on Frontier. Cross-platform scripts? Yes, that's what we're doing. And a cross-platform verb set, object database, outliner, threaded runtime, and content tools."/>
			<outline text="It's an appealing story. Over the last couple of weeks I did demos for execs at major technology companies. They were totally excited. I don't think these people could have seen it if there was no Windows story. And for me it was refreshing to see powerful people I respect getting excited about my software. That couldn't have happened if it were Mac-only."/>
			<outline text="To the people who say we're abandoning the Mac: How do you know? I can't see how it will turn out from here, so how can you? A request -- please be positive. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to tune into a powerful product that you think you're losing? That could keep you from losing it. We're still aggressively building on the Mac platform. Tune in and use it. Let's have fun guys and gals. That's what it's about. Not gloom and doom."/>
			<outline text="One final perspective, the Mac is not a religion, it's just a platform. The disappointment some people feel these days is related to accepting that idea. It may be a better computer, but it's not a cause. I've always been offended by the idea that the Mac is morally superior to other platforms. That idea led to the mess that the Mac is now. To be competitive, a platform has to grow. Maybe once the idea that it's just a (very good) computer sinks in, the Mac platform can grow once again."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft's Internet Services Library"/>
			<outline text="System people, app developers and script writers, need a programmable foundation to access the Internet through. Neither Netscape or Apple is providing such a foundation at this time. Last month Microsoft announced the Internet Services Library, or ISL. I was briefed on this software in April. It's one of the reasons I decided to work with Microsoft and have been supportive of their presence on the Mac platform."/>
			<outline text="ISL provides all the basic Internet protocols and a low-level stream layer so we can build our own clients and servers on top of their software. It makes it easier to define new Internet protocols, because they develop much more quickly in a scripting environment with its own database. With native performance, scripts run very quickly, keeping up with faster net connections which are becoming cheaper and more commonplace. ISL is more than a breakthrough, it will allow other breakthroughs to happen."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is committing professional resources to this project and building on it themselves, providing the quality we need to commit to developing to their interfaces. And it's interesting that the Mac is leading Windows in this area and Microsoft is doing the development. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is taking a pragmatic step, looking for ways to develop relationships with Mac developers. They got here first. They're providing technology and resources we need. It's a totally acceptable proposal, so we accept it. "/>
			<outline text="We hope to release a test version of the ISL with Frontier bindings before the end of September. Please watch the Frontier website for news. If given the opportunity, we'll work with Netscape and/or Apple or others to assure that the scripting interface for Internet services is uniform across all software and perhaps cross-platform."/>
			<outline text="***More mail from Gates"/>
			<outline text="From Bill Gates, billg@microsoft.com: &quot;One thing I forgot to mention in my other mail: Thanks for supporting Windows. We also believe that Windows and Macintosh are both important platforms.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="That's how you do it. Gates, for all the negative energy people direct at him, is a class act. Actions speak loudly, so do words. It costs nothing to say thanks. Then why do some people refuse to do it? "/>
			<outline text="***Be Story"/>
			<outline text="On the Macintosh Scripting list, a discussion of the relative merits of the Be Operating System and the Macintosh Operating System. From an Apple developer... &quot;Be is going to have a difficult time selling this machine to the masses and developers. As long as they stay small, they can survive, but getting over the numbers hurdle is tough. Apple has a substantial head start and look at how tough it is for them.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="My response: &quot;As many girlfriends have pointed out, it isn't how big it is, it's how you treat them that matters.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I'm aware that many programmers will find this uncomfortable, but as always developer relations is a mating ritual. It's amazing how well the metaphor translates. Jean-Louis doesn't cut corners. He sends flowers. He's patient. A feature many wives and girlfriends, and developers, wish for."/>
			<outline text="***International Check It Out Day"/>
			<outline text="No doubt some people still view the world in terms of labor and management, so I suggest we keep Labor Day a national holiday, but add another one, sometime in early-mid-October, called International Check It Out Day. On that day, you could ask any question of anyone and the person or people could choose to respond in one of three ways: decline to respond, tell the truth, or lie. That's the normal thing. The new thing is that you'd be able to ask anything, without anyone getting angry with you or assuming you're trying to make a point. And maybe you'd get some interesting answers. You'd certainly get more to think about."/>

			<outline text="***They say goodbye to the Mac"/>
			<outline text="Today's Wall Street Journal has another gloom and doom Mac is dead piece. "/>
			<outline text="I'd like to rebut. There are millions of Mac users. Important software keeps coming on Macintosh, much of it isn't available on Windows. They talk about retail shelf space as if that mattered but ignore the fantastic software distributed via the Internet. How many of them visit the websites where innovations are shipping on the Mac? Clearly the Journal hasn't been covering the story where the action is -- on the web. "/>
			<outline text="Apple is at least partially responsible for this. Their home page rarely points outside of apple.com, leading people to think that less interesting new stuff is happening on the Mac. They fear us -- what would happen if they appeared to support what we're doing? They could give it a try. http://www.apple.com/ gets huge flow. Share some of that flow. It would be good for business."/>
			<outline text="Even more disappointing, yesterday an article appeared on ZD Net talking in emotional terms about our announcement that we are porting Frontier to Windows. A quote: &quot;Winer has long been one of the Mac's most fervent adherents. Perhaps only a defection by legendary Mac evangelist Guy Kawasaki could have been worse for Mac morale.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Defection? Huh? No way. Let's clear this up. I'm continuing to invest in the Mac.  My web tools and servers run on Macs. This piece was written on a Mac and shipped via email using scripts that run on a Mac. Today all the software I write only runs on Macs. Someday soon some of it will run on Windows, but it will be a long time, I think, before Windows has parity with the Mac in this area. Sorry Windows users, if you want the most powerful and complete web content tools, you gotta use a Mac, despite what the Wall Street Journal and ZD Net tell you."/>

			<outline text="Some ideas for ODB apps... A fast class hierarchy storage system for Java code. A way to share persistent data thru Java. A new storage system for Internet Config. A replacement for the Mac Resource Manager. A cross-platform Resource Manager! A shared file system for the Mac. (The Mac file system has a plug-in architecture.) A storage system for AppleScript that doesn't require Frontier. A Frontier-compatible persistent storage system for OpenDoc. A database for an email client. A database of web addresses shared between web browsers. A database for an email server. A fast back-end for a web server."/>
			<outline text="All these apps would be compatible, could share data, and they could be powerfully scripted thru Frontier (there's our incentive...)"/>
			<outline text="I'm sure other ideas will come along."/>
			<outline text="We wanted to open this up so that all hell could break loose. "/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***Mac, then Windows"/>
			<outline text="A Windows version of ODB Engine will be available in October. Same terms. Developers who have Macs get first shot at this technology. That includes Apple. Can we sieze an opportunity and make it an advantage for the Mac platform? This is out of my hands. I can make the offer. It's up to others to accept the invitation and build on our technology."/>
			<outline text="Mac developers first: Can we have your support? We'll be making the same offer to Windows developers next month."/>

			<outline text="PS: People ask about source code for ODB Engine. We will be willing to license source if people adopt it. It's kind of a chicken-and-egg thing. I understand that people (reasonably) want access to source. But it will come with restrictions that assure continued compatibility."/>

			<outline text="No one has yet launched a platform with the intent of being kind to its community. Let's imagine a new platform vendor acting as an open distributor, instead of as an exclusive innovator. A financial entity that flows investment into the community instead of concentrating investment in its R&amp;D labs. A platform that's loyal and fair to its users and developers could have a unique place in the world of interconnected people."/>
			<outline text="***What matters"/>
			<outline text="It's communication, not technology, that matters. ActiveX and Java and cascading style sheets aren't the issues. What really matters -- fostering healthy communities of human beings using computers to communicate more effectively. Everything else is secondary. I think this is the big idea, and people who see it as Microsoft vs Apple or Microsoft vs Netscape miss the big picture."/>
			<outline text="There are two sides to this argument, those that say &quot;Let's Be Predictable!&quot; and those that say &quot;Let's Have Fun!&quot; Apple seems to have been founded on the latter principle and has drifted into the former."/>
			<outline text="A new technology company founded on the principles of openness, one that built on the competitive efforts of hundreds of independent entrepreneurs, one that implemented a simple policy, every employee with their own web site, edited by them, saying what they have to say. One that allows power to flow thru the world, instead of just inside itself. Such a company would be in agreement with the world, going with the flow, participating in evolution instead of trying to stall it."/>
			<outline text="Such a company would have a chance competing with Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="***Evolving"/>
			<outline text="Don't look to the &quot;New Media&quot; companies to bring you the future. They're still vested in editorial policies, control of opinion, the sanitizing of people, the lie that the future is knowable or that any single human being can take control. "/>
			<outline text="The nature of computers is a chaotic cacaphony of humanity. When it all looks too neat, too sewn up, it's a lie -- because human evolution isn't really that neat. Familiarity and predictability are best-sellers. But the truth is that we don't know. Where are we headed? We have hope!"/>
			<outline text="We also have many important things to do. It's time to understand how our planet works. It's time to visit other planets. Let's learn how to listen to each other and ourselves. It's time to evolve. "/>

			<outline text="When we let go of the old corporate architectures, not just at a technology level, but at a human level, we'll be able to build more powerful connections between people. The old way of doing things, exec staff meetings, budget reviews; the introspective nature of corporations; is obsolete. This idea has run its course. It will eventually fail at every company, even new ones. We expected greater things from Apple. In the end, they are just another company. We'll get it elsewhere. "/>

			<outline text="When I look up a current news topic I'd find pieces written in the last couple of hours. Limit the crawler to news-oriented sites that are current on a 7-by-24 basis. Refresh the site as often as CNN refreshes Headline News."/>
			<outline text="It's a chicken-and-egg thing. Until such a search engine exists, the value of 7-by-24 sites won't be realized. It's the next level of competition in search engines. I believe that before the November U.S. election, we'll have such a site in place. It'll be total killer, just like Alta Vista was when it first came out."/>
			<outline text="***Got two computers?"/>
			<outline text="Most software assumes the user has a single machine. If you can relax that assumption you can build a whole new kind of software, stuff for users who have a machine they can delegate tasks to. After a half-decade of dreaming about personal agents, I think we're finally ready. I have the need myself, since I receive hundreds of email messages a day, many of which contain valuble information that I'd like to use or refer to in the future."/>
			<outline text="People with an extra computer can have their own search engines. All their written work is filtered, cross-indexed and sorted. If you can make it flow thru email, it can be more useful to you. The other machine, your mail organizing database, is busy categorizing and sorting things while you're writing and reading. This is not beyond the leading edge. We can set up these kinds of servers now, in 1996."/>
			<outline text="Having a second machine can make you more powerful. A software company that specialized in making apps for people with more than one machine could find a niche with lots of fertile ground and could create a following among net users. This is one way of looking at the big new software market that the Internet opens up."/>
			<outline text="***Mail Agent Protocol"/>
			<outline text="The MIDAS process, which I wrote about several times in August, is moving forward. A network of websites is developing. Proposals are being written. The promise is being delivered on. It's coool."/>
			<outline text="Earlier today I posted a protocol for Mail Agent processes. The protocol is already implemented in Eudora and Frontier. With more mail clients coming on the Mac, it's time to document the protocol, creating a platform for mail agent scripts like the ones described above that work across all email clients."/>

			<outline text="Yeah-yeah I'm deep in Docs right now. I feel like a manual writer. I guess that's because this week that's what I am. Can't wait to come up for air so I can start doing business development stuff around this new software."/>
			<outline text="The Windows version of Frontier is coming along. Something will ship by the end of the year. "/>
			<outline text="I have a Windows NT server now. http://ws5.scripting.com/. I've even put a little website on it. Right next to the NT box is a BeBox running its demos and looking very sexy and inviting. Hmmmm."/>
			<outline text="***The Whiteboard Cam"/>
			<outline text="On Sunday, as a diversion, me and my pal Chuck Shotton put up a new thing called a WhiteBoard Cam. It's like a Fishbowl Cam, or a Space Needle Cam, except it points at a whiteboard! Forget about wizzy page editing tools -- this is the ultimate ease in web content tools. "/>
			<outline text="It's just like writing. Duh. Hey you can check it out at http://www.scripting.com/lab/whiteboardcam.html. You can see what my handwriting looks like. Y'all come visit now. Set down for a spell. Good home cookin. Coooool."/>
			<outline text="And if you need a dose of Dave-writing, watch my news page. I'm doing lots of writing, but it's for script writers and webmasters. I hope to be done with this project by the end of the weekend so I can return to entertaining myself (and you!) with DaveRants."/>

			<outline text="PS: I hate docs!"/>
			<outline text="PPS: Microsoft's new Denali server architecture implements something like our Open Scripting Architecture. It's a gooood match. Yeah! Our object database and scripting and page rendering tools will plug right in. Davey likes this."/>

			<outline text="***Does lightning strike twice?"/>
			<outline text="The team that delivered Java at Sun Microsystems and spun off into a separate Kleiner-Perkins funded startup, Marimba Inc, has announced a pair of new products, Bongo and Castanet. "/>
			<outline text="Hey -- if there was ever any doubt if the product naming genius that came up with the Java brand left with this group, the debate is now over. Cast-a-net! Wow. Wish I had thought of that name. Brilliant! It's very powerful. "/>
			<outline text="What about the products, are they brilliant and powerful too? Yes. There are so many holes in the software world today, it's nice to see people taking a chance at filling a couple of very big ones. "/>
			<outline text="Bongo is Marimba's UI design tool for Java code. It extends the Java runtime environment beyond the toolkit that Sun provides, known as AWT. It's guis built by gui. It looks very powerful. It's also aimed at script writers. That's cool too."/>
			<outline text="Castanets are those little shells you hold in your hand while dancing to Latin music. It's also a client and a server, or tuner and transmitter, using Marimba's terminology. If you have an application that can be broken down into components, Castanet will keep the client's version in synch with the server's version of the same structure. This works for Java bits, but can actually be used for any kind of data that's stored in a hierarchic filing system."/>
			<outline text="Synchronization software that runs over the Internet. Nice. I'd like to use it."/>
			<outline text="***The Mac Problem"/>
			<outline text="I had to get a PC to get Pointcast. I also had to get a PC to try out Marimba's stuff. There's no Mac version, just Solaris and Windows."/>
			<outline text="The Java situation on the Mac is confusing. It's clear that Microsoft and Apple are not cooperating. It's also clear that Microsoft is hiring the best talent in the Mac Java world, having just recruited Rich Scorer from JavaSoft and Chris Evans and Rick Eames from Natural Intelligence. Metrowerks has always been a close ally of Microsoft's. Apple may not want to work with Microsoft, but Microsoft isn't giving up just yet. Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="Where is Netscape? They've got their own entry in the Java Runtime sweepstakes. Theirs is actually shipping, in Netscape 3.0. It's the only widely deployed Java Runtime on the Mac. But Java bits only run inside the browser with Netscape, and Marimba and others want to run outside of the browser."/>
			<outline text="Which one should Marimba and other Java developers deploy with? Time will tell. In the meantime it's confusing, and is leading to a bad situation where Java-based stuff deploys on Windows and Sun but not on the Mac."/>
			<outline text="A lose-lose-lose situation. Yuck!"/>
			<outline text="***We're almost finished"/>
			<outline text="We're in the final stages of the endgame on the project that's kept me from writing DaveNet pieces for the last few weeks. I'm really tired! I wanted to get this story out about Marimba and the Mac Java situation. I also want to write about the new stuff we've been doing, but that will have to wait. I have some gardening to do (chrysanthemums are blooming!), and more goodies to ship. I want to wait until my perspective is fresher before writing about the new software in DaveNet. "/>

			<outline text="It's playoff season in the baseball world. A Mets fan sent email asking if I know the spring training schedule. Haha! I'm a Mets fan since 1962. Do you remember what it was like? I do. There was this guy, a sign-maker with a great sense of humor, he came to every Mets game and sat in the front row of Shea Stadium. He had signs that had something funny to say. "/>

			<outline text="Not a problem."/>
			<outline text="***Java Java Java"/>
			<outline text="What the hell is Sun doing with Java?"/>
			<outline text="It's true that they have the world turning around them due to some brilliant (and confidential) license agreements. I've tried to learn what restrictions are on the various licensees of Java. No one will talk."/>
			<outline text="Sun is scared out of their mind of Microsoft. Scared into denial. Microsoft is leaving no room for Sun to dominate on the Windows platform. And there is an incredible anti-Mac bigotry at Sun. "/>
			<outline text="The personality of the Old Apple has found a new home called JavaSoft. The Holy Grail at JavaSoft is Java toasters, Java cellphones, Java running on every conceivable appliance. They don't care about the Mac, but if you say cellphone, boom! action at the highest levels."/>
			<outline text="That's who's running the Java world."/>
			<outline text="***Marcia Marcia Marcia"/>
			<outline text="No, my eyes don't glaze over when I think of Java cellphones. I never bought a Newton. I do own a cellphone, but I use it as a phone, not a PDA. Instead I now have five systems on my LAN all running web servers! I moved into territory that Sun is strong in. Have they tried to sell me anything? Have they ever come to me, on my terms, and offered me anything that makes sense in the world I already understand? No."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has, of course. The NT box on my LAN supports AppleShare. The NT file system is an icon on my Mac desktop. Amazingly, the new web search engine software that I'm using can index a website that's running on my NT machine. It's amazing because it runs on a Mac. That's integration."/>
			<outline text="With DCOM and Denali, you'll be able to run Mac scripts as CGI apps behind an NT server. I find that amazing! A committment to opportunity. A sense of how the world really works. Websites are LANs. Sysops can mix and match brands of hardware to get the best effect. "/>
			<outline text="How could Sun have let this opportunity escape them? If they sold a fast inexpensive Unix box that plugged into my Mac network, I bet I would have bought one by now. But Sun is dreaming about world domination, erasing Microsoft and making smart toasters. Oh those white boys and girls. Earning their fat paychecks and selling their shareholders down the river."/>
			<outline text="It's like The Brady Bunch, which I never watched (I'm from a earlier generation). My younger friends tell me about the middle sister of the bunch who would always say Marcia Marcia Marcia. I say Java Java Java. People hear Marcia Marcia Marcia. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="To be a leading platform, Java is going to have to embrace and work with non-Java apps on all platforms, Mac included. The Java environment is incomplete. Its use as a web content tool is over-rated. The Mac platform has a bunch of technology to help Java, but it doesn't come from Apple. An oft-repeated tune in this column. Think about it. Just think. A little bit."/>
			<outline text="***An offer"/>
			<outline text="Back in the early nineties, a year before Newton launched, I made an offer to the Newton team at Apple, which in hindsight could have saved them if they had gone for it."/>
			<outline text="We were developing a scripting system designed to hook into all the popular apps on the Mac platform. We already had the hooks into FileMaker which was the most popular Mac database (still is). We offered to supply the software that would connect Newton into FileMaker. We could have done this in weeks instead of the years it took when they took the do-it-ourselves path."/>
			<outline text="We offered to do it for them when there was still time. It was what they needed. We needed them to add hooks to the Newton Mac client. They blew us off. Ask anyone who used a Newton why it was so frustrating. One answer: it couldn't share data with their desktop system. "/>
			<outline text="I wrote about this in 1994, in one of the first DaveNet pieces, &quot;How to invest in PDAs&quot;, 10/14/94."/>
			<outline text="Java needs the same thing, connections to the flow of information and ideas on the platforms they are trying to build on. Software is the key here. Data formats. Synchronization and reconciliation. Smart and open connections to desktop apps."/>
			<outline text="I make the same offer to the Java community, at Sun and elsewhere. We can flow your information thru apps that real people really use. Eudora, Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, WebStar, Netpresenz, StuffIt, BBEdit, the Finder, GlobeTrotter, Quark XPress, FileMaker, you name it. We connect to them all. And the Mac OS itself. We can't help you on Windows yet. But we can do amazing stuff with Mac apps. Come have a look."/>
			<outline text="***Frontier 4.1"/>
			<outline text="Earlier this week we released Frontier 4.1. What a labor of love! It was intense. But it's over now. I can tell because I'm typing this on a new keyboard and have a new mouse. Whenever I ship I get a new keyboard and mouse. It improves my feelings about the computer tremendously. I type with authority. I click with real feeling! "/>
			<outline text="If you employ programmers or writers, and want to reward someone for a job well done, send them flowers, of course, and also buy them a new keyboard and mouse. The fresh flowers make a lasting impression. So does the fresh new keyboard."/>
			<outline text="***MIDAS and Frontier-talk"/>
			<outline text="On the MIDAS mailing list, we've been locked in debate over silly syntactic details on a proposal we made about macro syntax for web page rendering software. In the meantime, market opportunities are passing, chaos continues to reign, other standards bodies are working on less adequate solutions, and some are thinking of going ahead without a standard, trying to achieve defacto status thru market muscle instead of informed consensus."/>
			<outline text="In contrast, in the process of shipping Frontier 4.1, we agreed to many new standards for this part of the Mac scripting community. It was an interesting study in contrasts. We can move much faster here because we have a central and relatively benign leader... Me!"/>
			<outline text="I've learned so much about platform management in the last few months. All the complaints I've ever had about Apple were sent back to me. I hadn't been watching what was going on in our community. And some of them weren't watching me. So we collided."/>
			<outline text="Then we backed off and people got back to work. Two new leaders emerged in our world. Preston Holmes is graduate student at UCSD and Brent Simmons is a web developer and software entrepreneur in Seattle. I learned to depend on these guys in ways I used to hope Apple would depend on me. I trust these people. I let them lead. My employees can't cover all the bases. We're stronger because they're here. They don't work for me, but we cooperate."/>
			<outline text="This was what I wanted. I find that you need a different kind of patience. But if they're good people (they are!) it's always worth the wait. We've attracted the very best people in the scripting world, and we want to attract more. I want the Frontier world to be about success. People achieving new stuff that they used to dream about. People who beat their competitors because they build with our tools and runtime. People who make money, lots of it! and have fun, and most important, respect each other. We try to take the high road, look for win-wins, where ever possible."/>
			<outline text="We're also competitive. We make offers to others to work with us. If they say yes, they're our friends. If not, we blast them! Not with words, we're too respectful for that. We deliver the software they dream about. It's a competitive world. We like that."/>
			<outline text="Next week I'm going to help one of my developers launch a new product. It's commercial. It has a pricetag. It's worth every penny. It's fantastic stuff. It's respectful. What a milestone! Stay tuned."/>
			<outline text="***Denali on the Mac"/>
			<outline text="Another thing to watch for is an implementation of Microsoft's Denali web serving technology on the Mac platform, running behind Mac web servers."/>
			<outline text="I was briefed on their plans a few weeks back and I liked most of what I saw. But I saw a collision in syntaxes, the same page rendering problem I mentioned earlier in this piece and in &quot;Midnight Plane to Windows&quot; 9/12/96."/>
			<outline text="We're going to do what Denali does on the Mac platform. Our technology will offer a plug-in architecture for macro syntax. We'll support different syntaxes thru plug-in modules. We need to have cross-platform agreement on how scripts appear in web pages. Everyone's singing a different tune. We need an orderly infusion of technology here. "/>
			<outline text="By shipping a syntax-agnostic framework for adding macros to web servers we provide a platform for experimentation, and for sorting out differences. The Rosetta Stone of web page macro syntax. We're almost ready with this piece. I'll point you to it in DaveNet of course."/>
			<outline text="***Scripts in web pages"/>
			<outline text="I have more to say about scripts that live in web pages. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's Denali approaches web pages as islands separated from other web pages. That's not the nature of the web. Each site has many pages which can contain their own scripts and data. How does a script on one page invoke a script on another page? Here's the object orientation that's coming on the web. A page is a very nice unit. Yes, it has an object hierarchy inside it, but more important, it lives in an object hierarchy called a website. And that's contained within a hierarchy called The WorldWide Web."/>
			<outline text="Imagine a class system that can span the whole web. That's what we've been working on for two years. That's getting pretty close to being ready now. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Many thanks to my programming partner, Doug Baron, for a job well done on Frontier 4.1. We still make shitty software, with bugs. But it just keeps getting better and better!"/>
			<outline text="PPS: MIDAS stands for Macintosh Internet Developer Association."/>

			<outline text="***MacHack and Upside"/>
			<outline text="I wrote about the MacHack conference in &quot;Picky Crabb&quot; 6/8/96! "/>
			<outline text="In July I went to Detroit, Michigan of all places, to be the keynote speaker for the MacHack conference. There I met with Paulina Borsook, loris@well.com, who was covering the conference for Upside Magazine, as part of a piece she was doing about the Macintosh developer community."/>
			<outline text="Her piece is out now, in the November issue of Upside; it's beautifully written, really interesting, so I asked for permission to run it thru DaveNet, and now here it is."/>
			<outline text="***Keeping The Faith by Paulina Borsook"/>
			<outline text="Hegel had it right: First you have thesis (Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., can do no wrong and is the most adorable and infallible computer company in the history of the universe); then antithesis (Apple has hopelessly tanked, can do nothing right and is being abandoned by all sentient beings). But history doesn't stop until you get synthesis (Apple has a little-known resource in its loyal, if unruly, developer community, that will play a key role in the company's turnaround). "/>
			<outline text="In the same way that third-party developer Adobe Systems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., rescued Apple more than a decade ago with the invention of desktop publishing and a natural captive market for the Macintosh, there is still a chance--indeed, even increasing acknowledgment of the possibility by Apple executives--that developers could yet save the company's butt."/>
			<outline text="For the many critics who think the Mac is doomed to become the Amiga of the '90s, remember what the Viet Cong, driven by fierce attachment to their home platform and their spirit of independence, were able to do to France and the United States. Passion can often accomplish what mere business interest cannot. And the motivating force of Apple's developers has far more to do with passion than it does with business."/>
			<outline text="If that force can be channeled and not abused, Apple may very well survive and even flourish, though perhaps in a changed form. Some developers believe that if Apple would get out of their way, everyone's fortunes would improve (&quot;For God's sake, hold thy tongue and let us love&quot;)."/>
			<outline text="It happens over and over again. Two years ago, it was a developer, not Apple, that made it possible for the company to go forward with its strategic new hardware platform. Macintosh toolmaker Metrowerks Inc. of Austin, Texas, released Code Warrior, a developer's toolkit for the Power PC, when Apple had none. Today, Code Warrior is used by the vast majority of Apple Power PC developers, from Adobe to solo practitioners."/>
			<outline text="Developers are a platform's distant early warning system. If they are disaffected, listless, off their feed and reluctant to write for a platform, the platform is doomed. Alternatively, if they are jumping all over themselves to write for it, there is hope. Given this, it is interesting to note that The Programming Starter Kit for the Macintosh (Hayden Books), written by Jim Trudeau, a Metrowerks employee, is selling as well as any guide to the far trendier Java.  It's also worth noting that, as of second quarter '96, Metrowerks, a company that has linked its corporate existence to Apple's since the middle '80s, hasn't had a downturn since its fortunes really began to rise with the debut of the Power PC platform."/>
			<outline text="The relationship between Apple and its developers is best characterized as a loving but screwed-up marriage, or a summer camp where the counselors and the campers swap roles but keep coming back year after year. It is a human ecology with a unique set of drivers that distinguish it from the Wintel or Unix communities. It is a dysfunctional family that can be either healed or split apart."/>
			<outline text="As in any troubled, intense relationship characterized more by love than by pragmatism, complaints are bitter. But nobody wants to leave. Developers often say they love the technology but not the company, which is not very far from saying they love the sinner but not the sin, or the drinker but not the alcohol. It's a fractious, exasperated but engaged extended family. Former Apple employees leave to become developers at Adobe or Macromedia Inc., San Francisco, or even at Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., or form countless startups. And formerly independent developers become Apple employees. Folks change name badges, but they're really just wandering to different parts of the community."/>
			<outline text="The sense of community among Mac developers is inconceivable in the Wintel world. Contrast it with Corel Corp. of Ottawa, Ontario, the graphics market leader in the Wintel world. It decided in the summer of 1996 to release its first Mac software because Macs are where visual-arts types work and play. But if it doesn't work, Corel will drop the Mac market, with no sentiment and no hair-tearing. This is not the attitude of Mac developers, some of whom may, by market exigencies, feel they may no longer be able to offer Mac versions of products but will anguish about not doing so. And they may continue to develop Mac versions in-house, for personal use, because they find the platform so damned sweet and elegant and better to develop on."/>
			<outline text="Amid all the squalor and the bickering there is still tremendous enthusiasm among Macintosh developers for the Mac platform to succeed, despite their current righteous and vocal indignation at Apple's many stumbles and its arrogance. And the company's relationship with its developers, which was improving even before Apple CEO Gil Amelio and Vice President of Developer Relations Heidi Roizen came onboard in the past year, is improving even more quickly under the new regime. The adorable side of Apple still appeals to the faithful, even as the incompetent side has, at times, seemed to drive them away."/>
			<outline text="All unhappy families are unhappy in their own way. Many in the Apple developer community lament the errant ways of the mother ship. Yet many of the offenses developers feel Apple has committed--announcing technologies and strategies that never happen or are very late; competing with developers, often with inferior programs developed in-house; generally being a mercurial and maddening partner--are crimes all computer companies commit (similar transgressions haven't hurt the success of Microsoft Windows). "/>
			<outline text="But feelings run stronger and grievances are deeper with Apple. Perhaps expectations for deportment are higher since a) Apple is family, and while you expect to get screwed over in the Hobbesian world of business, you don't necessarily expect to get screwed in a relationship where you identify or feel a kind of unity with your partner, and b) Apple is the company of &quot;computing for the rest of us.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Where but in the Apple community could there be an institution such as MacHack, the annual independent jamboree of Mac programmers held in Dearborn, Mich.? Going into its 12th year, MacHack has flourished, until recently, largely without Apple's support (although the company traditionally cruises the programmer hoedown for potential hires) and has created a culture rivaling the Net's in richness of folklore, drama, rivalries, villains, geniuses, heroes and catchphrases."/>
			<outline text="The most famous aphorism is, &quot;It's Jordan's fault,&quot; referring to Jordan Mattson, the first Apple employee who made a major but unofficial commitment years ago to participate in MacHack in an active way. Since Mattson, a rank-and-file Apple engineer, was at the start the sole representative of the love thing that MacHackers' loved to hate, he became the object of their complaints and thwarted desires. At first in a casual way, and then in a more official capacity, Mattson tried to bring developer concerns back to Apple. Therefore, as a joke, as hyperbole, all things related to Apple-the-company are said to be &quot;Jordan's fault.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="One MacHack institution is the Bash Apple session, where folks line up in front of a microphone to complain. At the 1996 MacHack XI last June, the Bash Apple session raised questions ranging from the annoying (Why are developer discounts less than what's available through mail order?) to the seriously puzzling (Why has Apple appeared to have abandoned the university market to IBM?) to the philosophical (When is Apple going to stop competing with its developers and concentrate on core technologies?)."/>
			<outline text="The mood among the MacHack Apple bashers ran the gamut, from playful to irate to painfully sincere, but they care enough to want to be heard, and they believe in Apple enough to feel it is worth making the effort to speak up. It is not so much an atmosphere of animosity and antipathy as it is one of &quot;We are all in this together, trying to preserve this thing we love.&quot; Think of a cousins' club argument about the decaying summer house in New Hampshire. It is not akin, say, to fleeced pensioners going after Charles Keating or to pro- and anti-gun-control fanatics screaming at each other."/>
			<outline text="MacHack has formalized its complaint session with a &quot;Top Issues for Apple&quot; ballot, where attendees vote on the 10 issues they feel Apple must pay attention to. (&quot;Raise Jordan's pay,&quot; with the explanation that &quot;It's all his fault, anyway&quot; was one of the sample issues on the 1996 ballot.)"/>
			<outline text="The kind of complaining and snorting accompanied with eye rolling and endless inventories of past grievances and private language bespeaking long intimacy overheard at MacHack is precisely what goes on in any messed-up love relationship. The pain of being together is not greater than the pain of being apart; the opposite of love is not hate but indifference. Mac developers need requiting."/>
			<outline text="Perhaps the most notorious of the disgruntled Apple developers is Dave Winer, who delivered the keynote at the 1996 MacHack. His DaveNet list-serv tells the world what he thinks Apple ought to be doing and reminds his readers how Apple has done him and others wrong. A classic DaveNet rant from October 1994: &quot;A platform is a Chinese household. One rich husband. Lots of wives. If the husband abuses one wife, it hurts all the wives. All of a sudden food starts getting cold. The bed is empty. All of a sudden the husband isn't so rich.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Winer, who made his fortune in the 1980s with More, an outlining program for the Mac, didn't meet with similar success when his Frontier scripting language came out around the same time Apple was pushing its competing and more successful AppleScript, developed in-house. The ensuing debate has become an urban legend on the order of Kentucky Fried rats and black widow spiders hatching in never-washed bouffant hairdos. Did Apple screw over one of its developers by creating an inferior competitive product? Or was Frontier never destined for mass-market success because it was more technologically sophisticated than the average Mac user wanted? Or was AppleScript's success relative to Frontier some nonlinear mix of the two? Whichever, Winer for years has been trading on his misfortune, a prophet without honor in his own country, Apple. But he still expects Gil and Heidi to take his calls promptly and his admonitions to heart. His is a sort of familial pay-attention- to-me-I'm-yelling-at-you-for- your-own-good attitude."/>
			<outline text="Winer's endless scolding is typical of a certain mentality in the Apple developer community. May 1, 1996, DaveNet, re: Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki: &quot;It's coooool. Yeah. Gooood Morning! Hey, Guy Kawasaki is in the Wall Street Journal. Upppfh! He says Apple is a cause. No, Guy, Apple is a company. It's a great computer. But that's all. Apple is a mediocre company. It's made every mistake it possibly could, missed every wake-up call. There's no love for the company because it has no love for us. The community is worth fighting for. But I won't fight for Guy's job. Sorry man.&quot; If it's so awful, Dave, then leave. But nah. As many other developers seem to feel, it's just not the same with anyone else. "/>
			<outline text="In his August 23, 1996, DaveNet, Winer shocked the Mac community by announcing his intention to go cross-platform, something all Mac developers must do to survive in the 1990s. &quot;I'm not saying good-bye to the Mac, but saying hello to Windows,&quot; is how he phrased it."/>
			<outline text="However, times are changing. Mattson, the first MacHack visitor from Apple, is now Apple's business development manager for Internet development tools. Jordon's fault has now become Apple's policy. Even at a place as chaotic as Apple (compare Apple's address, One Infinite Loop, no adult supervision, to Microsoft's address, One Microsoft Way, everyone on Bill's page), the advent of Gil and Heidi has brought a re-emergence of a strategic commitment to developers."/>
			<outline text="At MacHack XI, Roizen arranged individual videoconferences from Cupertino for anyone who wanted one (family obligations kept her in California). Easy access to Heidi, whom the MacHackers trust, signifies that, yes, Apple is really trying to change its evil ways."/>
			<outline text="On the stage of the Bash Apple session this year, facing the questions from the audience, were scores of Apple employees, some of whom had flown in at their own expense. Their responses to complaints ranged from joking to sheepish to concerned to, &quot;Yeah, it's a mess, and we're trying to change it.&quot; Apple's new management wants to revamp its reputation as a 500-pound gorilla with epilepsy: a large, dangerous, semi-intelligent organism inclined to fits and disorganization. It has thus promised several new programs for developers."/>
			<outline text="Promises have been made and broken before. Developers have long complained about having a decent relationship with an Apple employee, program or technology, only to have that relationship go to hell when the employee leaves or goes elsewhere within the company; or when the program is killed in some internecine Apple battle; or when the technology is flubbed, ignored or stalled because of a lack of consistent corporate vision. These developer nightmares may go away once some of the tendency toward city-republics and independent principalities within Apple have been reined in."/>
			<outline text="Still, will solving these nightmares create others? What developers rightfully want and need may be tricky to obtain precisely because the same things that made Apple distinctive also drove it to the perilous straits the company now finds itself occupying. You needed a high opinion of yourself and your originality to want to work at Apple; Apple did innovative stuff because it attracted folks with that personality type and often left them alone. Yet the result was a hermetic smugness and lack of attention to the Great World Outside and an absence of consistent corporate vision. In other words, the place of the Insanely Great has also been the place of the Spent Genius and the I'm So Cool I Can't Stand Myself. If discipline is asserted and some corporate consistency created, will Apple still be the breeding ground for what developers and consumers consider cool? "/>
			<outline text="And Apple must be cool to survive and be Apple. It must keep coming up with its own private and innovative technology solutions. Otherwise, why and how should it continue to exist?"/>
			<outline text="The debate over whether Apple still has what it takes often takes the form of the quandary all lovers face: The stuff you love is the flip side of the stuff you hate; they are two sides of the same coin. Were Powertalk communications technology and GX printer technology (both developed by Apple) examples of the technically interesting, even elegant, stuff that was developed despite what the market wanted (Powertalk has been canceled and Adobe already had PostScript), or do they demonstrate the Apple engineering gift for creating better stuff, which sometimes the market recognizes and validates, and sometimes it does not? Is today's CyberDog Internet technology yet another example of the nifty stuff that Apple is famous for coming up with that can't and won't be adopted by the market? Will Apple's bet-the-company investment in Open Doc (another elegant technology), its object-oriented component-software answer to Microsoft's OLE technology, pay off? With all these technologies, developers ask: Do we need them? Are these examples of the cutting-edge stuff that Apple has historically done best--and why we want to continue to program for it--or are they simply technically interesting rat holes we don't want to get into? "/>
			<outline text="One sign that things may not have changed is Vice President and Chief Scientist Larry Tesler, one of the more controversial survivors of the Apple regime. Yet another guy with noble-PARC-in-its-glory-days lineage, Tesler's involvement at Apple has included the Lisa, the Newton and eWorld. Not a great track record. Tesler historically has not had strong links to the Internet technical community, the most important group of developers today. But now he's in charge of AppleNet, the Apple division responsible for ensuring that products are fully Internet-capable."/>
			<outline text="Like everyone else, Apple's future is tied to the Internet. In Apple's case, maybe more so. For one thing, the Mac probably has far greater market penetration (50 percent or so, depending on whom you talk to) in both Web servers and content-creation platforms than it does in any other industry sector, except for media/publishing/graphics. If Apple can capitalize on this, make nice to the latest generation of Apple developers, who are immersed in internal Web development projects, the company will come out just fine, thank you."/>
			<outline text="But the question of Apple's own Internet development effort is a sticky one. For one, Internet development has gone to a program office, which some folks would say is the kiss of death because, as is typical in most engineering environments, the best stuff is done in small skunkworks. "/>
			<outline text="Apple could even get left behind through no fault of its own. The browser wars between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Inc., Mountain View, Calif., may have an inadvertent pernicious effect on Apple and its developer community if, in an era of Web weeks, Netscape and Microsoft don't simultaneously release Mac versions of their dueling browser upgrades. Even though Microsoft has expressed a strong commitment to supporting the Mac (hiring lots of old Claris and Apple hands, offering to fund interesting Mac developers and simply remaining the biggest seller of Mac applications on the planet), in its push to overwhelm Netscape and own the Internet, it could drive Apple into the ground. "/>
			<outline text="Finally, Apple has not historically been involved with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the standards body determining the technology future of the Net, while Microsoft has. With luck, this may change in December, when the IETF returns once again to San Jose, and Apple should be able to send folks to the meeting."/>
			<outline text="If the company is to survive, developers must continue to be thrilled by the joy of writing for the Mac. That means Apple must continue to develop new technologies, but they must be divorced from Apple's Not Invented Here Syndrome and self-centered conceit, and yet not be estranged from market realities. It's going to be a hard stunt for Apple to pull off, yet a different one from the better-known necessities of getting its manufacturing and financial houses in order. The problem is that no one knows if this will sanitize the noble rot that has made the Mac a platform developers so dearly love."/>
			<outline text="If Gil and Heidi can find that balance, there is hope. Small developers know that the cost of entry into the Mac marketplace is far lower than into Wintel's, and that in all niches of the Wintel marketplace, especially the interesting ones, they will have to go up against Microsoft. Since the prospect of a world without the Mac is so foreboding, many developers continue to hang with Apple, providing the company with its best chance of success."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="A postscript. I hope DaveNet readers have noticed that since the formation of MIDAS, I haven't been airing strong opinions about Apple in DaveNet. I don't know if Apple has any more of a clue about what's going on, or if there's real teeth in their stated intention to stay out of our way, but the net-effect is the one we were looking for. "/>
			<outline text="Our stuff rolls forward, Apple is focused on its own problems. The world looks less and less to Apple to solve the problems in the Macintosh world, and that feels right. "/>

			<outline text="***Attend and Agend"/>
			<outline text="I'm going to Agenda, it starts this weekend. "/>
			<outline text="It's an industry conference. The money comes to Agenda. The CEOs of all the major technology companies. The leading venture capitalists. The business plans and the business press -- the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, the New York Times. It's a festival of judgment! Evidence of the pecking order of the industry. A major argument over who controls everyone else."/>
			<outline text="I always have a fantastic time at Agenda. A few days away from the details. I always come back with my head buzzing with ideas. I envy people who live at this level 365 days a year. My life is filled with details. But for three days every year I get to soar in the clouds, where every dream makes sense, and anything is possible."/>
			<outline text="I'm going to have a fantastic time at Agenda. The human drama, we manipulate symbols that tell a story and hide the fact that we're all trying to attain something that isn't in great supply at Agenda -- respect. Respect comes at the point of a gun at Agenda. Who has the power to push everyone else to the side? Most years it's been Microsoft. Lately it's been Netscape and then the Java community, but I bet this year the pendulum will swing back to Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="Too bad, because Microsoft doesn't embrace most of what's going on in the world, so to the extent that we accept the view that they control our destiny, we accept a limited version of what each of us can contribute. "/>
			<outline text="Ohhh it's Phoenix, it's in the desert, in the southwestern US. I like to go driving in the desert. Like the vistas at Agenda, you can see for miles! Hey, sometimes you're seeing mirages. Uhhh yah. The same visual effect at Agenda. "/>
			<outline text="***Netscape is Visicalc"/>
			<outline text="In this week's PC WEEK, Marc Andreessen says there is no market for web browsers. So where is the delivery on all the deep inhaling the net people were doing last year at Agenda? "/>
			<outline text="Hey, it's still about software and hardware. Add a net connection. Coool. Have the rules changed? Yes! Have Netscape et al embodied those changes? No. They drove right into Microsoft. They couldn't figure out how to zig while Microsoft zags. Java may look like a turn, but Microsoft has put up a roadblock in its way, called a Runtime. Ooops. Think again folks."/>
			<outline text="Netscape is VisiCalc. There's still a play for a 1-2-3. They built a company that looks like any Silicon Valley high tech firm. They're no threat to Microsoft. The real action will come from a new company that's not much of a company at all. One that takes a back seat to net users. Acts as an enabler with no control. A company whose bylaws say that every employee must have a personal website. Such a company would give Microsoft a lot of grief! And that's what Microsoft asks for, so it will get it."/>
			<outline text="Free software is just the first step. Free people is the next one. The owners of this company will be its users. It'll go public in a way that no company ever has. Every day will be a shareholder's meeting. Every day the business plan will be rewritten. "/>
			<outline text="***The center is nowhere"/>
			<outline text="I admit that I often have a superior attitude sitting in the audience at Agenda. I see the speakers engaging in self-promotion, telling us why their vision of the future is the one that will hold; why they will call all the shots. This is such an immature industry, I wonder if it will ever grow up? A few years ago the Net seemed like such a wonderful big world. Everyone could work together, the world was big enough for lots of new ideas. Too bad people felt threatened by it. Now this group of people is back where it started. "/>
			<outline text="We can sell technology and tools. We can arrange for the quick flow of ideas over the net. But thin clients and Java and whatever else (there will be nothing else) that's discussed at Agenda, only hide the truth that the center of this world is nowhere. It can't be controlled. "/>
			<outline text="There will never be an Agenda type conference that concentrates the power of the Internet in one place, because while that's happening a group of young people with no acknowledged stake in the future will be plotting the overthrow of the people who are posturing as the leaders of the net. And their ideas will work. Computers are a powerful medium. It doesn't take much money to make a net phenomenon. It'll be even more that way in the future."/>
			<outline text="Today's Net may look like a vast wasteland of self-important and tasteless and soulless commercialism, but I'm optimistic. I think we're in a quiet period. Things will heat up again, after we flush the system, re-learn some old lessons and then re-tool for the real changes that are coming."/>
			<outline text="***Nursing homes?"/>
			<outline text="Think about bandwidth and define it broadly. How big are the pipes that connect computers together? And how big are the reservoirs at either end of the pipe? I don't think of client machines as water taps, as some people do. In most cases they're more powerful computers than the servers. This is becoming more true."/>
			<outline text="I know it's hard to conceive of things this way. "/>
			<outline text="I remember seeing my first website on the net, and then seeing my first web server in person. There's a tremendous incongruence. How could this little computer have such a large presence on the net? Pay attention to this. The truth is that client machines are bigger computers than the servers."/>
			<outline text="People talk about thin clients, or Network Computers. I think they're super-boring. It's like living in the Wild West, and instead of building great ranches, people want to build nursing homes. Sure some people will get NCs, like airline reservation clerical people, the telemarketing staffs; they have no business looking at personal websites on company time. But remember the power of the back door. That's how Apple IIs got into the corporate world in the early 80s. Can the Internet be a back-door purchase? Yes."/>
			<outline text="Servers are specialized machines, but simple ones. You might  have a server that feeds out 50,000 web pages a day. It has 24 megabytes of memory and 512 megabytes of disk storage. A small crappy monitor. No audio. True, it has some wierd peripherals -- like a Connectix QuickCam. But it's nowhere near the power of a desktop machine. These days semi-serious users get 64 megabytes of memory, a 1-gig removable media drive, an internal 4-gig drive, a CD ROM, 21 inch color screen and music! (Paul Simon is singing about him and Julio down by the schoolyard as I write this.)"/>
			<outline text="The pipes are getting bigger. Irritating animated gifs pulse down the net, building up bandwidth. The reservoirs are getting bigger as RAM prices drop and graphic software wants more memory. In the meantime, chunks of code and data are starting to flow down the pipe. Code and data, as usual, is much smaller stuff than animated graphics. You'll hardly notice the time it takes to download the secure meta-data-mini-apps that will be so prevalent in the future."/>
			<outline text="High level frameworks are cool. Defacto standards are set by people developing quietly out of view of the Agendees. Standards bodies are logjams. Innovation happens out of sight."/>
			<outline text="***Scripting and the Internet"/>
			<outline text="Remember the buzz about artificial intelligence a few years back? Now it's time to go commercial with that stuff. The problem with the AI techniques back in the mid-80s, when they were the focus of Agenda-like conferences, was that there was limited data for them to work against. Take another look at your mid-90s inbox and ask yourself if lack of information flow is still the problem. Quite the opposite."/>
			<outline text="That's why scripting and the Internet are synonymous. The client machines run at hundreds of megahertz now. RISC is commonplace. Customization is needed everywhere. The development environment of the net isn't in compiled languages, it's in dynamic interpreted languages with persistent storage systems and bottlenecks that allow for customization and security. File systems are the past. Object storage systems that integrate with super-high-level languages are the new land."/>
			<outline text="Right now HTML text flows around the net. The next step is bits of code and information that assemble themselves on the client machine and use the rendering and UI engines, installed on the client, according to the preferences of the user, and subject to easy customization by the user."/>
			<outline text="So there are two bets possible right now -- one which emphasizes the power of the server, and one that bets on dumb servers and super coool clients. Go for the latter. It's where the power really is, as opposed to where it appears to be."/>
			<outline text="***No one understands the Internet"/>
			<outline text="I may sound like I think I understand the net, but I don't. "/>
			<outline text="No one does. "/>
			<outline text="The Internet has always been there, ever since the first computer crawled up on land and started serving bits. We ignored the net in the PC industry, hoping that Novell and then General Magic could deliver an orderly and dependable and controlled connected world for us. That only bought us a little time, and that ignorance made a thing like Netscape possible."/>
			<outline text="The same seeds that made Netscape possible make the next thing possible. Head-trips don't work, you won't be able to figure out where lightning will strike next. The only approach that works if you're a technologist, I believe, is to immerse yourself in the technology and try out lots of new ideas, and see which ones work. "/>
			<outline text="Then you go commercial, and hope you hit the window. If you do, take a break, and come back. If you don't, take a break and come back."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/24/96; 12:12:39 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Gooood afternoon and welcome back to California. "/>
			<outline text="I had fun in Phoenix! Saw some old friends, made some new ones, did some listening, did some talking. "/>
			<outline text="The most gratifying part of the show for me was talking with many of the people who read this column and finding out what the experience is like for them. Thanks to everyone for sharing their opinions. It's nice to be so widely and thoughtfully read. Coool."/>
			<outline text="So, there were two big controversies at this show -- What about the Network Computer? and What's the song?"/>
			<outline text="***What's the song?"/>
			<outline text="Let's deal with the song first. I think every conference should have one. The first order of business. Pass the mike around. What do you think? Play some tunes. Hmmm a few bars."/>
			<outline text="At the first lunch, we talked about the song. A bunch of ideas floated around. Then we settled on Everybody's Talkin', the Nilsson tune, the theme for Midnight Cowboy, the Oscar winner for best picture in 1969. "/>
			<outline text="It's a very short but powerful song. Everybody's talking at me! I don't hear a word they're saying. Only the echoes of my mind. People stopping, staring. I can't see their faces. Only the shadows of their eyes. "/>
			<outline text="What a beautiful song! Makes me laugh. He's going where the sun keeps shining, thru the pouring rain. He's going where the weather suits his clothes. Backing off the northeast wind, sailing on a summer breeze, and skipping over the ocean like a stone."/>
			<outline text="But later in the show, we found an even better song. It goes like this... "/>
			<outline text="***Que sera sera"/>
			<outline text="Whatever will be will be. The future's not ours to see. Que sera sera! "/>
			<outline text="It's a woman's song. As a girl, she wants her mother to tell her if she'll be pretty, if she'll marry a rich man, and her mother sings the chorus. Que sera sera! La la la la la la la. Later as a grown woman she asks her husband if there will always be rainbows. A wise man, he sings, que sera sera. The future's not ours to see, silly woman. (A Nilsson song!)"/>
			<outline text="It's a schmaltzy sad but hopeful tune. And it perfectly expresses how I and perhaps others feel about the infinite loop we call the computer industry. As much as (we think) we meet to talk about the future, we also meet to talk about our fear of the future. The software industry is an infinite loop. Everyone is talking, but very little learning is happening. "/>
			<outline text="Our infinite loop -- the condition we fail to test. In the past, have we ever seen the future correctly? No. We forget that every time we've tried to head-trip our way into the future we always get it wrong. The future happens anyway. It isn't ours to see. We joke about the missed calls, the wasted energy; but we still miss the point and keep going round and round the loop."/>
			<outline text="It started, in my experience, with the quest for the killer app for the home. This question was asked over and over in response to the boom created in the business market by VisiCalc in the early eighties. No such killer app was ever found. The best the industry could come up with was a refinement of VisiCalc, which we took as a signal to get sidetracked into the integrated software debates of the mid-eighties. The users failed to follow, spreadsheets matured into a category, and the software industry found other distractions to express its fear of the future."/>
			<outline text="Now everyone agrees that PDAs, object oriented OSs, artificial intelligence, interactive TV and convergence were actually hot air when they were the hot topics. Was anything gained by all the energy and money they wasted? Even Bill Gates admits that he was singing the wrong tune a few years ago. Yes, this is generous of him, but perhaps it's a signal to the rest of us not to be so enamored of the Great Ideas of any year, including 1996."/>
			<outline text="Maybe we give too much power to the icons of our industry? Maybe we fail to see how little control they have? Maybe we are responsible for thinking for ourselves and being responsible to our own interests. Maybe we fail to see what is? We're always trying to break out of the que sera loop, and we never quite manage to do it, and that's how our infinite loop works."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;ellison&quot;&gt;Ellison's honesty&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Never was this clearer than when Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle, took the stage with the conference host, Stewart Alsop. As he explained his concept of the Network Computer, or NC for short, his song said I'm great, you're not, here's my idea, love it or leave it. I'm taking over. Meet the new boss. Me!"/>
			<outline text="Ohhh, the crowd didn't like it. Boos and hisses. The rumblings were awesome. I looked to the left and to the right, forward and back. Everyone is angry with him. Great emotion was swelling up in the audience. I got up, took the mike and asked the question I thought everyone wanted answered. Why would anyone want to use this? Amazingly, Ellison hadn't addressed that point. I doubt if it ever occurred to him that peoples' wants could enter into the equation. To him, it was enough that *he* wanted it. What we wanted was not the point."/>
			<outline text="I got a clear message from Ellison, to shut up and sit down. Ask anyone who was there. He actually used those words! I was not surprised, but I was pleased. As a lab experiment it was perfect. Ellison is a straight shooter, unlike some, who could have deflected my challenge by offering some confusion. Ellison is too honest. He came right at me, said it didn't matter what I thought, or what I was curious about."/>
			<outline text="We like our despots to calm our fears. Everything's going to be OK because I'm such a lovable fellow! Ellison was not being lovable. I think this is how he earned the ire of the audience, not because he was caught with his hand in the cookie jar, presenting a half-baked idea as if it were an accomplished feat. That happens all the time at Agenda. "/>
			<outline text="He failed because he didn't come up with a joke or a smile or bow his head appropriately, or beg Stewart for a better position on stage, or tell us how good it would be for us to have him run our world. Ellison was bold and truthful in his assertions, and in being so bold, he did us an enormous favor. He showed us how foolish our search for the elegant leader has been and continues to be."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;mcnealy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;McNealy is smoother"/>
			<outline text="The next day, Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, presented basically the same idea as Ellison, but he gave us all the props, including stuffed dolls and funky homilies. But he is just as arrogant and clueless as Ellison, just not as easy to expose. He says that all you need from a computer is four commands. You don't need a PC, you probably don't need to store anything. It's not your computer it's the company's. Love it or quit."/>
			<outline text="Well, I've seen Sun's software, and I remember PCs when they were as simple (i.e. feature-poor) as McNealy's JavaOS NC is, and he wouldn't even be able to compete with the software that commercial developers were making in the mid-to-late 1980s, much less the software of the mid-to-late 1990s. So much has been learned since then, and none of this is reflected in Sun's NC OS. "/>
			<outline text="Why didn't McNealy invite us to come play in his ground? As I've written before, Sun barely shows up in my world. I'm a net developer. I've been doing commercial development for sixteen years. I read all the magazines. I get email from all over the world. The message &quot;Sun's stuff is great&quot; rarely reaches my desktop."/>
			<outline text="Maybe I'm missing something and maybe Sun's new system will find a home with millions of users, in the office and in the home, on shop floors and in retail stores. Where ever, or whatever. But McNealy could have made a lot more friends earlier this week if he had come offering to share what he had, enabling our creativity, showing us where we fit in, instead of threatening to destroy us, to invade us, to make us irrelevent. "/>
			<outline text="All the stuffed animals in the world can't hide the threat he was delivering. I'm great, you're not. That may temporarily get him an inflated stock price, but it won't achieve the dominance that he's saying that he seeks."/>
			<outline text="***Gates Gates Gates"/>
			<outline text="It seems that both he and Ellison are motivated on a personal level to displace Bill Gates as the perceived leader of the software industry. The truth is that none of them are qualified to lead us, because that isn't what they do. And Gates is not our leader! He's been appointed, true, by cover stories and homage from his competitors and the venture capitalists (John Doerr called him the chairman of the industry)."/>
			<outline text="We should see them for who and what they are and ask if what we really want is what they want from us -- to be destroyed. I for one, don't want that. I want opportunities. I want to create wonderful new things, to explore the leading edge without losing my senses, and to recognize and revel in the unpredictability of the world we live in. I don't want to impose my will on anyone, and certainly not at the point of a gun."/>
			<outline text="***The High Road"/>
			<outline text="To anyone who wants to lead -- show us software that's fun and empowering, get us interested and excited. Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted. We're at a crossroads now, do we go back to the mess of the past or do we learn to enjoy the que sera of it all, and stop seeing threats everywhere we look?"/>
			<outline text="So much of the energy is about defeating and destroying, so little is about creating. People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans. They forget that no matter how rich and intimidating each leader of our industry is, or would-be leader, none of them predicted the world we live in now, and by extrapolation they are powerless to control the world we will live in in 1997 and beyond."/>
			<outline text="I'll do my part: here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity. "/>

It won the Oscar for best song in 1956. I tried to find the full lyrics on the web, but the search engines I tried came up empty."/>

			<outline text="***Que Sera postscript"/>
			<outline text="I've sat in many dark halls thru my career listening to the kind of pitches that Larry Ellison and Scott McNealy were hurling earlier this week at the Agenda conference in Phoenix. My rage finally came out in a productive way, in the past I just fumed quietly, kept it inside (mostly) and the problem persisted, we just looped and looped. It's frustrating for me, as a commercial developer, because I generally keep my software visions to myself and try to keep the attention focused on what is, because there's enough there to focus on. "/>
			<outline text="Unfortunately, in the past, that made my ideas vulnerable to vaporware promoters. To those that think Bill Gates is the worst offender (I hear that a lot) it isn't true. The most offensive predators, the would-be visionaries, long-gone former industry leaders, would take the stage and dominate markets, without bothering to ship competitive software. These are the real destroyers. "/>
			<outline text="For all the negative things people say about Gates, he has usually been on the right side when the trances begin. I remember sitting in the audience listening to him talk about the object oriented craze that was sweeping the industry in the late eighties. He said &quot;I don't get it.&quot; Gates wasn't declaring his stupidity, quite the opposite. "/>
			<outline text="I don't want to debate the merits of various programming tools, and certainly not with people who don't program. Their arguments tend to miss the point. If you can make better software with object oriented techniques (1989) or Java (1996) -- more power to you. But who else (other than your competitors) could possibly care how you made your software? "/>
			<outline text="And why brag about it? If there's so much value in the tools that you choose, keep it secret. Shhhh. If people are boasting that they use the best tools, you can figure that they can't find any competitive advantage to using those tools, or else they wouldn't be presenting them as a competitive advantage."/>
			<outline text="Yes, there probably are opportunities in the Network Computer space, but the proponents incorrectly tell us that it has anything to do with hardware. That's a lie. Step one is to investigate the software issues. As a designer of end-user software, and an avid net user, I believe the experience could be more enabling and deeper and easier. More highly leveraged. More bang per user-hour, especially for people with high-traffic websites or mailboxes. But first, make it run on standard platforms. Make it simpler and more powerful. Do it again. Then, and only then, talk to us about a new hardware platform."/>
			<outline text="Instinct tells me that new hardware is not needed; that you could do a beautiful job of highly leveraged integrated net access without any change of operating system or CPU or (imagine this) leaving out a crucial bit of hardware, a disk drive. I think it's a fallacy."/>
			<outline text="I also don't think Larry Ellison or Scott McNealy have ever designed a commercially successful piece of software. Then I have to ask, who that I respect as a software designer, works at either of these companies? And are they working on the network computer? If either of these leaders really wanted to sell their ideas, they would have brought a software designer with them to explain what's going on. "/>
			<outline text="I can't imagine a truly creative software person working with Ellison and I can't imagine that McNealy gets involved in the details of what makes his NC work for real users. I'm a hard-nosed from-Missouri kind of guy when it comes to software. There are so many ways to go wrong. These guys don't even start out on the right track. "/>
			<outline text="The moral of the story: when a CEO of a software or hardware company takes the stage and tells you how big it is, it probably isn't that big. As my friend Jean-Louis Gassee advises, let others talk about its size. It's more convincing. "/>
			<outline text="***Looking back"/>
			<outline text="Agenda is a worthwhile conference. But its focus, by definition, is in looking forward. We just got thru Agenda 1997. Next year we'll be talking about 1998. "/>
			<outline text="Agenda could use some tweaks, for sure. I'd get the CEOs off the stage and bring up the people who are closer to the process of defining the future, or more accurately, on defining bets for the future. That's a tough job, picking the people that will define the coming year. No matter, that's not my problem."/>
			<outline text="Keep Agenda, but let's do another conference. It would come at the end of the year, or the very beginning. It would be a review of the year gone by. There would be no pre-selected speakers; how could you choose the speakers in advance? It would defeat the purpose. "/>
			<outline text="The people who speak would be the ones who defined the previous year. They would talk about the highs and the lows. With the rate of change these days, you can be fairly sure that at the beginning of the year, we didn't know that they'd be so important. They had an interesting year. Let's hear about it! "/>
			<outline text="What was it like to be them? Focus on story-telling. Their first Markoff article, CNN interview, PC WEEK first-look. The public offering. When did they get the idea that they were becoming a platform vendor? What would they do differently? What do their parents think? What did they learn about friendship?"/>
			<outline text="No slide shows. No demos. Just people. A beautifully-lit room. It'd be like a picnic or a great New Year's party! The microphone travels thru the audience. The stage contains one or more people. But they wouldn't have had a chance to prepare, or to get nervous, or to have their PR people place stuffed animals on every desk. And just a hunch, there wouldn't be any desks or pitchers of water, or M&amp;Ms or newspapers. But there would be music."/>
			<outline text="Think of Larry King or Barbara Walters as the moderator. Get to the heart of the story, to the heart of the person. The audience is encouraged to be boisterous but respectful. The goal is to get the story, to figure out what *really* happened. Questions would be pointed. If you're scared of the truth, don't come; and certainly don't get on stage! But, if you like to dance or sing or ski, you want to be there. If you like a nervous feeling in your stomach, you would like this conference."/>
			<outline text="What have we learned? What worked? What didn't? This industry never plays Monday-morning quarterback. Winning teams always study the game tapes; successful software companies do too, as do successful industries."/>
			<outline text="***PDAs, Macintosh"/>
			<outline text="Returning to the PDA example, the industry seems to have concluded that PDAs are failures, despite the quality we're seeing. They deserve another look. And even more important, we need to look at why we don't look. If this sounds recursive, it is. Look at how we look. I bet we'd uncover a lot if we did."/>
			<outline text="In this context, with all possible humility and objectivity, I ask you all to take another look at the Macintosh platform, as much as you may not want to. Apple is a total loss. Think DEC, only the defeat will be deeper. Will anything be left after? What will we have learned? When a platform vendor dies, who picks up the pieces? Tune out the Mac zealots, many of whom are disrespectful and offensive in their pleas for the platform. They make the rest of us look bad."/>
			<outline text="The Mac may have as many as 25 million users, and a pile of innovative software developers. Today's Mac users tend to be people who switched when other people were still using character-based systems. These are smart people! A huge concentration of energy. If you're a smart software vendor or system maker, you may want these people in your camp. Don't make them wrong. "/>
			<outline text="Apple's letting them go. Do you want them? Opportunity knocks. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/29/96; 6:47:08 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Saturday night I watched the last game of the 1996 baseball season. The Braves vs the Yankees in game six of the World Series. Before watching the game I checked my hometown newspaper, The New York Times. There's a rivalry between Atlanta and New York. They're taking shots at each other. "/>
			<outline text="Atlanta is the city on the rise. The home of the Olympics and Ted Turner, CNN and the Braves. A baseball dynasty, the Braves have been in five World Series in the nineties. Atlantans think of New York as Babylon (which is actually on Long Island) with a crumbling infrastructure. An obsolete town. Old Media. Grouchy cab drivers and waiters! "/>
			<outline text="New Yorkers like to point out that Atlanta has the highest per-capita murder rate in the country. A tiny city by New York standards, with huge poverty. The Atlantans respond with southern hospitality. Y'all come back now! Then New Yorkers point out that Ted Turner is great, for sure, but he sold out to Time-Warner, a company based in (you got it) New York."/>
			<outline text="Who cares? Both are great cities. I prefer New York. So be it. OK. Let it rest. Well, not quite. At the end of the game, the series over, the TV camera focuses on a sign, clearly from a New Yorker with a New York attitude. He sums it all up. &quot;Y'all Go Home Now.&quot; Ooops. "/>
			<outline text="So much for northern hospitality. Hey I *like* grumpy waiters! Baseball is so cool. New York won. Congratulations to the Yankees and their fans. The Bronx Bombers. I'm still a Mets fan. Wait till next year! There will be a ticker-tape parade down Broadway later today. I wish I could be there."/>
			<outline text="***Is $25 million significant?"/>
			<outline text="What a question! In most contexts it truly is. If someone gave you $25 million it would probably change your life. But if it's the quarterly profit of a $10 billion company, two quarters after a $740 million loss, the answer is no. It's accounting noise, and it's insignificant. So why is the business press reporting Apple's $25 million profit as a sign of a turnaround at the company? Surely they must understand how the system works."/>
			<outline text="Here's how it works. A new CEO comes on board. It's financial house-cleaning time. Lose as much as you can right now. If you can move a loss into the past, the story looks worse now, but not much worse. And it isn't your fault, it's your predecessor's. In the wierd logic of corporations, this is good news. Glad he's gone. The worse the old guy is, the better the new guy appears to be. Onward!"/>
			<outline text="It's a flexible but honest system. If you're losing, at some point you have to report the loss. You can't keep moving losses into the future. If your business is unhealthy at some point the numbers will reflect it. "/>
			<outline text="Check Apple's numbers some time next year for a dose of reality. "/>
			<outline text="***Ellison revisited"/>
			<outline text="I got so much mail from the piece I did on Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, the lonely wolfe of the software biz, on the prowl for chickens and Bill Gates. "/>
			<outline text="Ellison is really out there. In an excellent and revealing piece in the current issue of Fortune, 10/28/96, Janice Maloney gets to some of what makes him tick. The pictures are of a lone man, piloting a huge yacht in San Francisco Bay. An adventurer who last year broke his neck and punctured a lung in a surfing accident. His sexuality is an issue. He says &quot;I like women, no doubt about it.&quot; Maloney and her editors must have thought this was an important part of the Ellison story. "/>
			<outline text="In the Wall Street Journal and on Oprah he says he wants to marry again. Wife number four. He wants an exciting woman, smart, and very good looking. Will he get one? And if he does, what will he do with her? Will he let her pilot the yacht? "/>
			<outline text="Listening to him I'm reminded that business and baseball are often symbolic stages for our sexuality. If you look deeper into what motivates business people (and writers!) you may find, just below the surface, a desire to express feelings that have been supressed. Ellison is fascinating person because he's so open about his sexuality. It's right there, up front, so in your face that you can't help but wonder about it. "/>
			<outline text="All his money must be a barrier. It keeps people away. How many other billionaires are there for Ellison to play with? And is he the kind of man who shares his toys or is he the kind who kicks and scratches and tattles? I want to know what kind of mother Mrs. Ellison was. This  50-year-old boy seems to be hurting, but he doesn't seem to want a hug. What does he want?"/>
			<outline text="People who think that financial wealth is a panacea should look again. Money builds walls that separate people from each other. Inside the walls is not a happy place as many people imagine. Once people attain wealth, they still must struggle with their issues, and since we look more closely at wealthy people, the struggle attains a twist, it's important to hide yourself. Ellison breaks the pattern, he's an open man, he tells you, clearly, what's really going on with him."/>
			<outline text="I look at the pictures, read the interview, and think how much it must hurt to be Ellison. Where's his community of peers? Who else has the power to create this huge yacht and staff it with yachting experts? What woman deserves his brilliance? And what woman will want it? "/>
			<outline text="Against this backdrop, the issues of the Network Computer and Bill Gates and Ellison's potence as a software industry leader seem to be secondary. We're seeing a huge bonfire built of cash, it says Look Here! Something great happened. I'm ready to kick butt! All by myself. No invitation to play, to have fun, just an invitation to admire Mrs. Ellison's little boy."/>
			<outline text="I wonder what would happen if we said yes, we admire you Larry. "/>
			<outline text="Now what?"/>
			<outline text="***Little boys"/>
			<outline text="In reading the previous section I am aware that it might appear that I'm criticizing Ellison for being so open, and for exposing his inner child in print and on TV. Not true! I want to be clear about this."/>
			<outline text="If you can't tell, I have little boy too. His name is Dave. He wants to play! Coool. So, please, it's important to create a safe play space for our little boys and girls; but it's also important to take a chance. Risk is cool. No pain no gain. So, with all due respect, thanks to Mr. Ellison for having the courage to talk about himself in public."/>
			<outline text="***Overhead"/>
			<outline text="Every once in a while I have to, or feel I have to, set the context for this writing that I call DaveNet. This is one of those times. If you are already OK with this stuff, feel free to skip to the next section. This is overhead, I admit it. But you gotta pay the bills, every once in a while."/>
			<outline text="In &quot;The State of the Net&quot;, 10/18/96, I talked about scripting, and how it's become synonymous with the web. I believe that's true. I think the leading software developers would agree with me. Netscape is betting heavy on JavaScript, Microsoft on Visual Basic, Sun and others on Java. Who will disagree with the statement that a website is actually a piece of software? If not, where's the dividing line? I'm a writer and a software guy. I think I see this more clearly than most people do."/>
			<outline text="Even so, I got several comments on that mention of scripting, since in addition to writing DaveNets I am also the author of a scripting system for the Mac platform, and soon for Windows. Some of the comments were sarcastic. (I hate sarcasm!) They all accused me of being unobjective. I'm sensitive to these accusations, as would any writer who takes his or her writing seriously."/>
			<outline text="Every writer has conflicts. Anyone who writes without conflict isn't living a life. We do the best we can to keep the different parts of our lives separate, but it's a joke! Maybe that's where great writing comes from, the struggle to build a personna that's free of conflict, totally objective, with no body, no need for food or love or human contact, no diversity. "/>
			<outline text="Following this to its logical conclusion, the best writer would do nothing but write; would never take a hike, never fall in love, never earn a buck, never buy anything. That would be god. If you want to hear from god, go to a mosque, church or synagogue. Or be with yourself, go deeper, you may find god in there."/>
			<outline text="I am not god. I have conflicts. I am not objective. I aim to learn and teach, to amuse and evoke, and most important to share myself thru writing. Verbal expression is my thing. I really like to write. I take risks in my writing. I expose my vulnerability. Ask anyone! And when I write about scripting, there's nothing casual about it. I believe in the stuff. "/>
			<outline text="I have a choice -- attempt to hide my passion for scripting, and the people who do it, to draw a line that excludes my life as a software developer. Or I could draw the line on the other side and include it (as I have), with the disclaimer that this is one of the major things I do. Understand that my objectivity in this area is non-existent. "/>
			<outline text="Further, I don't have an obligation to tell you everything about myself. It's up to you, the reader, to take everything I say with a grain of salt. To question it, to get the facts, to draw your own conclusions. Think! Respect yourself. And understand that most of who I am is not public. "/>
			<outline text="For example, when I'm focused exclusively on software development, as I was in September and early October, from time to time I get the idea that some facet of the software could benefit from exposure to DaveNet readers. There's a lot of value in a plug in DaveNet. It's a flow-builder. But Dave the editor tells Dave the software developer that this is an inappropriate use of the medium, just as I would tell anyone else that wanted to run an ad in this column."/>
			<outline text="It actually happened once -- someone asked me to run an ad masked as commentary. He is a famous journalist for a famous newspaper and should have known better. It was just as DaveNet was starting and he must not have understood that my integrity is important to me. The man had just written a book. He wanted me to run a review. He even wrote it for me! (and put my name on it). I asked him to send me the book to read and review, if I thought it would be interesting my readers I'd write about it. He refused. I got a speech about what a low form of life I am. I went into a silent rage."/>
			<outline text="Nothing that dramatic has happened since. Nowadays I believe that writers I respect also respect me. I do this because I like to write and share and influence. That's all that's going on here."/>
			<outline text="***Stop That Prop!"/>
			<outline text="If you've been paying attention you already know that California's Proposition 211 is a very important issue in this year's election. "/>
			<outline text="Election Day, November 5, is one week from today. This is the end-game. "/>
			<outline text="It's hard to imagine how we'll do business if Proposition 211 passes. It makes it easier for attorneys to prosecute class-action suits against public companies, especially high tech companies. The lawyers make a lot of money. Shareholders, employees and citizens pay. Big time."/>
			<outline text="Here's how it works. A company reports earnings that are below expectations. The stock price drops. A group of attorneys file a lawsuit on behalf of the shareholders of the company. A judge issues an order allowing the attorneys to access all the company's business records, email, correspondence, meeting notes. The company must comply. The attorneys go on a fishing expedition, looking for anything that makes it look as if the company knew what was coming and didn't tell the shareholders."/>
			<outline text="The complaint grows. Damages are detailed. Were any shareholders actually hurt? It doesn't matter because shareholders pay the settlement price in a successful strike suit. So the money just moves from one hand, back into the other hand. With a tariff, of course. The attorneys in the strike suits are the only ones with a net-positive cash flow, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars every year. It's the shareholders that pay the price, the people these attorneys claim to protect."/>
			<outline text="But Prop 211 takes the current system a step further. An important part of the current corporate system is protection of officers and directors from personal financial liability. If it becomes law, Prop 211 would remove any possible protection. The assets of all officers and directors would become exposed. So what? you say. Get their money. They're all rich anyway. Well, it won't work out that way. They'll just resign!"/>
			<outline text="Now, you might like that system. Only people with zero assets will be able to afford to run a public company. Here's your chance to get rich. Ah ah. As soon as you get some money, they'll sue you! Ooops."/>
			<outline text="I try to imagine how this world would work, and I come up empty. If nothing else, right or wrong, this is a major revolution for the economic system of California. We should consider it more carefully before ratifying it. We should debate thoughtfully. The chaos that will result will put a lot of people out of work. It's dangerous stuff."/>
			<outline text="Plus, companies will have to devote much more energy and attention to defend against these suits. There's the catch, to protect shareholder interest, they have to defocus from the shareholder's interests. It doesn't work. Prop 211 is an irresponsible no-win power grab by greedy attorneys who represent no one but themselves."/>
			<outline text="But it gets even worse because Prop 211 will impact any company that has even a single shareholder living in California. This law will upheave the entire U.S. economic system! Could the voters really be so dumb that they would go for this? We'll find out on November 5. "/>
			<outline text="What to do about it? That's simple... "/>
			<outline text="Please vote no on Proposition 211 on November 5."/>
			<outline text="And tell your friends."/>

Netscape was still a dream for Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark. We were still looking to Microsoft for the source of all new things in the software business."/>

Will the web really free people and their ideas or is it just more of the same? Who knows. I'm feeling less optimistic now than I have in the past.

			<outline text="Apple fell right into the Microsoft trap. They zig after Microsoft zigs, sag when Microsoft zags. Is it too late for Apple? They bought into the mega-company model. They couldn't win with that strategy. It's just about run its course."/>
			<outline text="Be is different. Gasse and his team have gone to school in the art of platform management. He knows there has to be teeth in his statement that he won't compete with developers. The only way to assure that is to put a limit on the size of his company. If their cash model doesn't allow them to compete with developers, then we can be fairly sure they won't interfere, and will probably support developer's products. Impotence is the best insurance."/>
			<outline text="Gasse's track record in this area is good but not perfect. As a top exec at Apple he subscribed to the sell-what-you-have religion, as opposed to usual Apple sell-our-stuff rarified air approach. But Gasse was a member of Sculley's team that let Microsoft have the high ground with no contest. It doesn't matter; I think he learned the lessons that needed learning. I trust him because he understands how platforms grow, and won't make the same mistakes that Apple's management would probably make."/>
			<outline text="***Apple JavaOS?"/>
			<outline text="Another option being explored by Apple is the idea of a JavaOS/Mac. Make a new operating system that combines the best of the Macintosh with the best of Sun's new network computer architecture. It's an interesting idea, perhaps, especially if it were being conceived to leverage the strengths of the Mac platform (it isn't), but it doesn't give Apple a future. "/>
			<outline text="Reading the industry weeklies, it seems that corporate developers are using Java as a way of expressing their dissatisfaction with Microsoft, but it will be a short-lived rebellion. Why not use Microsoft's Java? the CEO will ask. The CIO will either go with Microsoft or get a new job. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has the answer to Java. It's called Java! &quot;Embrace &amp; Extend&quot;. The only way to exist alongside Microsoft is to do things that Microsoft can't do. Microsoft can fully embrace Java. It plays to their strengths, it doesn't harness &quot;Web Energy&quot;, it's a losing strategy. "/>
			<outline text="So what can Apple do? "/>
			<outline text="***The boring strategy"/>
			<outline text="Sorry to the Apple execs who seek glory, but the strongest path forward for Apple is to get much smaller and become boring. Focus on System 7 as if your paycheck depended on it. Drop ambitious plans to integrate Copland with BeOS. Visibly withdraw from System 7-related technologies that you aren't funding, or where you have no hope of competing with developers. "/>
			<outline text="Approach the venture capitalists and find out what it would take to get them to invest alongside you. There's huge cash flowing into new software development, and almost none of it is going to the Mac platform. This is an unacceptable situation. "/>
			<outline text="Apple has negotiating power with the investment community, but isn't using it, primarily because of conflicts of interest. To be attractive to outside investment, the Mac needs Apple to let go of a lot of people. The honest thing for these people to do is to write a business plan that calls for laying themselves off. I doubt if they'll do it."/>
			<outline text="Apple's idea of doing a brain transplant for BeOS, if true, proves that nothing has changed at Apple. My prediction -- if the deal goes thru as it is being currently talked about, BeOS will become Copland, will be managed by the same people that wasted all those hundreds of millions of shareholder dollars, and no new operating system will ever ship. The execs at Apple will hold on to their jobs for one more go-round, and the Mac platform will fade even further into the background."/>
			<outline text="I am opposed to Apple's acquisition of Be. License the Be OS as-is, invest in Be Inc. if they'll let you, but keep Apple's engineers and execs away from it. "/>
			<outline text="***It's Election Day in the US"/>
			<outline text="The only issue I take a stand on in this year's election is California Proposition 211. I still say  &quot;Stop that Prop!&quot; Interestingly, I got some passionate email in favor of 211. I stopped and thought. Maybe I should run some of that commentary? But the writers wouldn't go on the record. "/>
			<outline text="Read the Upside piece, it's still an accurate picture of valley life. Some companies book revenue this quarter and hope that they can make it up next quarter. We've seen this kind of management collapse many times in the past. Remember Ashton-Tate? I think even Oracle got caught with its hand in this cookie jar. Sun had a financial meltdown in the late eighties. "/>
			<outline text="It seems that some of Larach's suits had merit. The SEC is in favor of Prop 211? That's interesting!"/>
			<outline text="Prop 211, if it passed, would force companies to be more careful, to live in the present, to not borrow from the future. The penalties for being dishonest would be much more severe than they currently are. "/>
			<outline text="It's possible that I would support a 211-like proposition if it weren't drafted so heavily in favor of plaintiff attorneys, and if it didn't expose directors and officers to personal liability. I'd like to see these issues handled by the corporations, in the form of new bylaws and procedures. A company could voluntarily adhere to certain rules, and gain a higher rating from analysts. I think it's sound business practice to put some limit on deception by management. It would also head off future attempts to regulate the industry, assuming Prop 211 fails in today's election."/>
			<outline text="I'm glad I took a stand because it got me more educated on the issues. But my position remains No on 211. It may have some merit, but it's not a good law. "/>
			<outline text="***Maggy's website"/>
			<outline text="Every once in a while I get a pointer to a great personal website, one where the author writes from the heart, goes thru the fear, and tells the web what's really going on with them. "/>
			<outline text="So much of the web is Las Vegas-style crap, motivated by a very low opinion of what turns people on. Money can't buy art, and the web *is* an expressive medium. People want the truth. Holding hands in cyberspace is still what it's about, even though that's often masked by animated GIFs and pulsating Java applets. The best sites are the ones that reach into your heart and pull. Hard! They teach you something, about the world, but more important, about yourself. That's art. That's what turns me on."/>
			<outline text="Last week I was browsing http://www.projectcool.com/, and jumped to their Sighting of the day. "/>
			<outline text="It took me to http://infoweb.interaccess.com/maggy/. I started clicking. Read the diary. Looked at some pictures. A woman. She's a cutie! From Rumania. She's young but she has a daughter. Lives in Chicago. She's in love but she's scared. Yeah, just like everyone. My heart goes out to you Maggie! I sign the guestbook. Look at the site log. "/>
			<outline text="In her diary she says she wants a hug. Coool. I sent her email. I believe that people who open their heart in public deserve our support, a connection to their readers. Simple praise based on what was actually said on the site. It's the currency that makes the wheel turn. "/>
			<outline text="Web writing certainly isn't about consolodation or fear of asking questions or doing an IPO. It ain't about money, it's about love. Check out Maggy's site. Spend a couple of hours there. In the end, you won't think I'm very out! Maggy really pours her life into the web. She belts out the lyrics as well as I've ever seen it done. She might be the Aretha of the web. It's cooool stuff."/>

			<outline text="We're reviewing virtually everything in our code base as we take it apart and put it back together as a cross-platform system. One of the things we're seriously considering is dropping our table editor and replacing it with a new kind of outliner. No promises, but we're looking at this very closely."/>
			<outline text="Look and feel issues come up! Oh boy. Look at Windows. The whole thing is an outliner. Look at the Registry. Powerful stuff. Anyway, like the Mac, they have their own idea of what an outline looks like. The + and - leader characters are a throwback to ThinkTank. They worked well then, but I like graphic wedges better nowadays. "/>
			<outline text="I think the vertical split in each Windows outline, where the elements of a &quot;directory&quot; are displayed in another window pane, is a dead-end. Unfortunately all Windows software seems to have gone down that road. "/>
			<outline text="What to do? Should we have a different look for outlines on the Mac and Windows, or have a universal cross-platform look? This is an interesting question, since I think I understand outlines better than the designers of either of these operating systems. Oh. Oooops. "/>

			<outline text="***The Arrogance of the Mac"/>
			<outline text="From www.dictionary.com, arrogance is &quot;a feeling of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner or presumptuous claims.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Flipping thru the 11/05/96 issue of MacWEEK. A full-page ad for Intercon Systems. Black background, white letters. Page 19. "/>
			<outline text="A puzzling headline. &quot;We've created the easiest way ever for Mac users to connect with the world of Windows. Sorry.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Huh? Why are they sorry? "/>
			<outline text="The body text explains. &quot;Despite what you've heard, Windows users aren't evil. They just don't know any better. PC people aren't the enemy, they're simply in dire need of the vast wisdom of the Macintosh community.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="This makes me feel sick. My stomach gets queasy. My hands ache. My neck tightens. What can you do about such nasty arrogance? Of all the things that need fixing in the Mac community, this is the biggest. Windows isn't broken! Of course Windows users are not evil. What an idea. They don't know any better? Oh man. What rock did the jerk who wrote this ad crawl out from under?"/>
			<outline text="The Intercon message is deliberately disrespectful. They paid money to get that message in front of hundreds of thousands of people! Amazing."/>
			<outline text="Try substituting women for Windows users. Or Jew or Negro or Bosnian or Serb. I wonder if anyone has actually done a study. Are Windows users more likely to go to jail for child abuse? Are Mac users more likely to go to heaven? Let's get a life. "/>
			<outline text="If you care, next time you hear a Mac user talk this way, tell them how it makes you feel. Point them to this piece if you want. This arrogance has to stop now."/>
			<outline text="***&quot;R E S P E C T&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Respect means &quot;to show consideration for, avoid intruding on or interfering with.&quot; The dictionary has a lot to say about respect. It derives from Latin, to look at, look back on. To respect someone you acknowledge their existence. To show disrespect is to push away, to simplify, to ignore. To show a deliberate lack of consideration for others. "/>
			<outline text="Let's look at why Mac users should respect Windows users. First, in many ways their operating system is more powerful than the Mac OS. There are a lot of features in Windows that I've wished for in the Macintosh. The logic of Windows is totally open and subject to modification by the user or sysadmin. "/>
			<outline text="But features aren't the most compelling reason to respect Windows and all that it represents. We must respect it simply because it exists. It's a growing platform, they are moving. Windows 3.0 was a shell on DOS, a competent one, but not really comparable to the Macintosh. Even Microsoft people acknowledge this. "/>
			<outline text="Then came Windows 95, and NT 4.0, which brought Windows to parity-plus, and created the opportunity for Windows apps to do the same kind of stuff that the Mac development community had been doing with System 7. "/>
			<outline text="And Microsoft has woken to the web, and is moving their operating system to places that the Mac OS *may* be moving assuming everything goes right at Apple. But at the very best, the Mac OS will trail Windows in important areas. Don't miss this. "/>
			<outline text="The arrogance of the Mac, in 1996, is so uninformed, so inaccurate. Mac users may look to the past for glory, but in the future, you'll have more feature-envy than glory if you have the courage to look. "/>
			<outline text="Even so, I don't admit that Windows dominates the Mac. I don't see anything I can't do on my Mac that I can do on my Dell clone. I don't hit deal-stoppers. As a Mac user I don't feel dominated. Maybe others do, but I don't."/>
			<outline text="The Windows community should respect the Mac because it exists. Millions of people use Macs. There will be reasons to use a Mac for many years to come. The split really serves no one. It's time to heal the wound. So many misunderstandings. So many wreckless people, on both sides. We've got to get them to stop speaking for us. "/>
			<outline text="***I've heard"/>
			<outline text="From people I respect in the Windows community, comes the message that when our web tools arrive on Windows we'll have trouble getting people to look at them because they &quot;come from the Mac&quot;. So the fear exists on the other side too."/>
			<outline text="The truth -- the web is where it's happening -- and websites are LANs. You can intermix hardware and software, choose the best tools for all kinds of applications and users. The limits came down, no one was looking, because everyone was watching the wizzy tools. But today you can mix hardware and software. If you won't look at Mac solutions or Windows solutions, you will lose if your competitors have the courage you lack. "/>
			<outline text="A Windows product is a Windows product. Judge each on its own merit. Lots of great things have come to Windows from the Mac. Certainly there's room for more software on Windows, no matter what platform it originated on?"/>
			<outline text="***From the Java community"/>
			<outline text="It's becoming clear how unfinished the Java environment is. How much it needs our help. But we get the old-time arrogance from many Java proponents. "/>
			<outline text="From an old friend comes the message that I should let him know when all my software has been converted to Java. Wow! Such blind faith in a language. Unreal. My response: if I wait for you to catch up with me, I'll wait five years. And by then my software will be irrelevent. "/>
			<outline text="They lecture us on how to make better software. Where's the evidence that they know how to make commercial software? So far most of the Java stuff I've seen is pretty unattractive or slow or incomplete."/>
			<outline text="Firmly myopic, many Java people have the blinders so totally installed that they can't see the value in anything that's not-Java. This will come back to haunt them. It's a baby community. They need to connect with other communities, not dictating terms, but asking for friendship and offering respect. A little humility, please! Let's be friends. OK?"/>
			<outline text="***Other people"/>
			<outline text="Other people are so religious. They don't know any better. They are not evil, they just need our guidance. We're smarter than they are. We see what they can't. The air we breathe is richer. "/>

I'm just one person."/>
			<outline text="***A retraction"/>
			<outline text="I want to retract a statement I made in &quot;The Arrogance of the Mac&quot;. I asked if we could all agree that all people who use computers are smart. Strictly speaking I can't make this statement and be sure that I'm right, because I don't know what it means to be smart in any absolute sense, so I don't really know if someone is smart or not. I'm not in a position to judge. I like to think I'm smart, but does that make me smart enough to know if someone else is? Well, I can have an opinion, but I can't know."/>

			<outline text="Correct. That's all we really know."/>
			<outline text="In my defense -- I was coming from the place explained in &quot;The Customer is Very Smart&quot;, 9/1/95. I was speaking from my own perspective, as a software developer, and a user being like a customer. I like it when people use computers, in the same way that a Democrat likes it if you vote Republican. I have a stake in this system, and I think that every person that connects with it is doing something elegant. My opinion. You're not wrong if you don't agree."/>

			<outline text="***Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="OK, I have a lot of opinions. That's mah job! I hate arrogance. You see it everywhere in the Mac world; in the signatures of email messages they dis Windows and Microsoft and Bill Gates. They call them Windoze, Microsloth and they question Gates's integrity. It's not uplifting. It doesn't make me respect the writer. I know they're full of it. I've always known it. "/>
			<outline text="For the most part, I say leave them alone. They're miserable people. Not fun-lovers. However, when it interferes with my ability to have fun, I want to do something about it. That's why I ran the last piece. The arrogance asks for exposure. The people who indulge themselves in this silly arrogance don't want to be exposed. That's clear from some of the personally insulting email I've received in the last couple of days. "/>
			<outline text="***How it's really done"/>
			<outline text="Watch a major sporting event like the World Series or the Super Bowl, and check out the locker room interview with the coach of the losing team. Does he say that the winner was an unprincipled inferior team? No way. "/>
			<outline text="We were beaten by the best! When you say that, you can still be great. They were greater. Maybe just a little bit greater? And maybe just for that one day. "/>
			<outline text="As the Mets say, Wait Till Next Year! Yeah. That could be the motto of the Mac community. :-)"/>
			<outline text="In the PC business, like the auto business, there don't have to be many losers. But if we act like losers, people are going to think there's a deeper reason than just that the other guys were a little better last year."/>
			<outline text="So the best thing the leaders of the Mac community could say is Microsoft is great! We love Windows! Bill Gates is very smart. Microsoft is a cooool company. "/>
			<outline text="***Are they?"/>
			<outline text="I've questioned Microsoft at times, and yes, sometimes I don't like what they do. But I've been in the software business for almost as long as Microsoft, and in all the years, I've never seen a company that's more inquisitive and for the most part, respectful. In any company of 20,000 people, there have to be exceptions. But the general attitude at Microsoft is to get involved with things they don't understand, rather than wish that they'd go away. Go back to the dictionary and look up respect. This is what respect is."/>
			<outline text="About the only thing I don't like about Microsoft is that sometimes some people at Microsoft indulge in the belief that the Mac platform is not worthwhile. At the top, I'm sure they know that this can come back to bite them in the future. Elsewhere in Microsoft they prefer not to look at ideas that appear to come from the Macintosh world."/>
			<outline text="***My small contribution"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to make a small contribution to elevating discussions on the net away from the moral goodness of either platform. "/>
			<outline text="Since I am perceived as coming from the Macintosh (I actually come from New York!) I have to start from this place. In fact, I came to the Macintosh via the PC, and before that the Apple II, and before that Unix and before that IBM mainframes. In many ways, I share the same pragmatic view of computers as many leaders of the PC and Unix communities. "/>
			<outline text="To those who claim there's a major difference between a Mac and a PC, here's what I have to say. Macs are powerful computers, not toys. And PCs are graphic computers with mice and great software. "/>
			<outline text="***What is power?"/>
			<outline text="Now maybe we're in a position to define a word that's thrown around very casually sometimes. The word is power. From the dictionary, it's the &quot;ability to do, act or produce&quot;. But there's more to it."/>
			<outline text="Power comes from delivering your message precisely. It doesn't matter if the Mac is a deep platform if the perception is that it's not."/>
			<outline text="It may be inaccurate to think that all Mac users are panic-driven jerks who flail aimlessly. It doesn't matter if it's inaccurate, if it's perceived to be the truth."/>
			<outline text="The people who want to make computers for Moms say that they had the best intentions, that they didn't mean to trivialize middle-aged women. It doesn't matter what they meant if people hear trivialization. "/>
			<outline text="Precision in message-delivery, the way your ideas are heard, is what matters. If you don't care about power, you don't need to worry about this. But if you're frustrated when the world ignores your ideas, you have to understand this equation, and respond accordingly. Messages need to be developed and tweaked, just like the interfaces of easy-to-use software. "/>
			<outline text="There's no winning strategy in painting other powerful forces as evil or inadequate. All it proves is that you've found no powerful response to them; and in declaring the winner to be inadequate, you are saying that you have no idea how to cope with their existence. There's no power here. So people call the show over. The Mac is encircled. No way forward."/>
			<outline text="Among people who develop websites using Macs, I see elegance, depth, maturity and power. To the people who are attracted to the losers, there's nothing I can do, so goodbye. When you want to have fun, say so, and you'll find that there are plenty of people who want to have fun along with you."/>
			<outline text="***Humor in advertising"/>
			<outline text="I've written about humor in advertising before. See &quot;Ain't it the Truth!&quot; 3/29/95. IBM software commercials are funny. Czech nuns talking about surfing the net. You're surprised so you laugh. It's funny because it's true. It reaches inside you in an elegant way to find one of your beliefs, deeply hidden. You feel joy in the connection with another person. You find a new reason to respect them. "/>
			<outline text="Humor has a great place in advertising, but it's very very hard to pull off. You have to start from a place of understanding. IBM can be funny because IBM has a deep long-term reputation for being stuffy. When they let their hair down, they can do it with irony. It's shocking to see IBM having fun. But it's cool."/>
			<outline text="Rodney Dangerfield is funny because he pokes fun at himself. If you want to create humor by putting someone down, make sure the person you're making fun of is you. If you ridicule someone else, many people won't think it's funny."/>
			<outline text="The best technique for humor is to first get the support of your audience. Do something meaningful and respectable. Do it again and again. Now, poke fun at yourself. They'll laugh. You'll win them over."/>
			<outline text="***Who is Intercon?"/>
			<outline text="The Intercon people say that their ad was meant to be a joke. But who is Intercon? How do I know that they're not arrogant Mac zealots? I don't. There are no cues, no smileys on their page. Have I ever seen an Intercon ad before? I don't know. Their reputation is murky. They are not IBM, not even close. "/>
			<outline text="A more appropriate ad would have said something like this -- &quot;Hello. We're Intercon. This is what we do. This is what we stand for.&quot; They need an introduction, many of them. Instead of asking for my support or sympathy, they said &quot;We're Intercon. Look at how nasty we can be!&quot; We're supposed to see the humor in this. I totally missed it."/>
			<outline text="I tried humor in an ad for Living Videotext, in 1987. A fish-eye lens picture of an angry boss. He's very upset. The tagline said &quot;He's got three questions, you've got two answers. You need MORE.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Did it work? Maybe yes, maybe no. I liked the ad! So did all the people who knew us. LVT employees really dug it. So did our most loyal customers. But what about people who didn't know us? I bet their reactions ranged from &quot;Who are they?&quot; to &quot;What is MORE?&quot; to &quot;I don't get it.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The best bet, for small unknown software companies, is to stick to facts and beliefs in their advertising, and leave the humor to entities with large reputations. If you have a joke to tell your inner circle, use mousetype (Apple used to do this very well), or use your website. Use advertising to introduce yourself to new users, and to arm your installed base with facts that help them sell your product to others. A little style, nice use of color, a powerful logo, these are all appropriate things. "/>
			<outline text="I believe it's never wrong to be serious in your ads. It's respectful. It earns you trust. It says you are serious. There's no more powerful message you can deliver."/>
			<outline text="The Intercon ad, if it truly was meant to be funny, missed the mark, widely. I can tell you this much with certainty, I didn't think it was funny. "/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon!"/>
			<outline text="After a week of meetings and interviews and online controversy, it's early Saturday afternoon and I've had a chance to reflect on some of what happened and something occurred to me that can be stated briefly (I think!) and I wanted to share, and ask for comments."/>
			<outline text="***The Web Happened"/>
			<outline text="Oh it's an oft-told story -- but it's worth repeating -- for the lessons we can learn from the perspective of late 1996. "/>
			<outline text="Three years ago, proprietary online services were the norm. America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, AppleLink. Microsoft was getting ready to launch Marvel, which became MSN. Apple was doing eWorld. These services didn't build on the open protocols of the Internet, some of them offered TCP connections (notably AOL) but beyond that, they were totally separate worlds. "/>
			<outline text="The vendors had maximum power. Users had to take what they offered. They were closed systems, software entreprenurs couldn't write server software, content tools, or try out new ideas for clients. "/>
			<outline text="Then the web happened. At first Microsoft barely noticed. Why? I believe it was because they were totally focused on Windows 95. Heads down, focused inward, not looking for new stuff, convinced that the world was theirs. The rest of the online industry was focused there too. Everybody was asleep while Netscape got on its feet, gained a sizable following, became a financial juggernaut. "/>
			<outline text="Things that people were sure couldn't happen... were happening! Netscape officials were making public statements about being the next OS. If Microsoft was listening they must not have given it much credence. Windows 95 remained the focus. The web was smaller than Microsoft, many people seemed to think. This thinking is still out there. It's still wrong thinking."/>
			<outline text="Now, in late 1996, the proprietary systems are gone or going fast. AOL has come down to earth. CompuServe has lost its content flow. Novell is undermined. MSN is becoming a web-based service, ready to lose huge money. Standards apply. Services are interchangeable. Proprietary advantages are irrelevent. "/>
			<outline text="Now many people are looking for a new Netscape. At the same time, all of Microsoft's attention is focused there. Could another Windows 95 be happening? Is Microsoft the broad complex creature everyone assumes they are, or do they have limited focus? Why wasn't the web invented, or at least discovered in their R&amp;D labs? And is the web just the first of a series of new computer-related activities that will happen outside their reach? If so, why is it outside their reach?"/>
			<outline text="Simple answer: they can't see it. Just as when Windows 95 was happening, if something like the web were happening now, they wouldn't understand. And what about all the Microsoft watchers and wannabes, would they see it? No. What about me? Hmmm. I wonder."/>
			<outline text="Things were much quieter, the world was much smaller, the last time something like the web happened. Microsoft took a leading position. It worked. They tried to do it over and over, and stagnation resulted. The web happened. A surprise! Will it happen again? I hope so."/>
			<outline text="***Shhhh"/>
			<outline text="Where will the new ideas come from?"/>
			<outline text="You can't look to the obvious choices. If a new idea has everyone talking, you can be sure it *isn't* going to happen. The power of this industry is largely negative. It's capable of stopping things, not creating new things. "/>
			<outline text="Any widely talked about possible standard, even if it has real merit, couldn't possibly be the next wave. Business plans that say &quot;We are Netscape&quot; won't work. Business plans that say &quot;We are quietly developing enabling stuff that others can build on,&quot; have a much better chance. The key word is &quot;quietly.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="It's a twisty bit of logic, but if you're investing, I think you have to get comfortable with this kind of thinking. In a sense, the less attractive an idea is, the more attractive it is! If a technology projects out into the future, solves a problem that people are likely to have in a couple of years, and if Microsoft and Netscape et al aren't talking about it, it's a good bet. Not a sure thing, just a good bet."/>
			<outline text="Further, if the business plan says &quot;we will be small,&quot; if it sets limits on where the company will go, the kinds of products it will create, the size it will attain, it has an even better chance. "/>
			<outline text="I know this is counter to the thinking of the industry, but I believe it's the only way to zig when larger entities such as Microsoft zag. They inevitably want to own all the standards. A small entity can partner, can link up safely with lots of other small entities. This is the only way to create lasting value in this industry, to bet on the chaos of the market, rather than invest in a plan to control the growth of technology."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/19/96; 8:27:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning! "/>
			<outline text="Lots of interesting stuff and new directions this morning. "/>
			<outline text="***Rainy season"/>
			<outline text="We have two seasons here in northern California. Summer, when it never rains and the days are hot and dry and the nights are cool and lovely. And rainy season, when it's warm during the day, and it rains all the time. "/>
			<outline text="This is my fourth winter in the woods. And even though a full T1 will be coming to my house soon, I'm so hi-tech, there's nothing to be done about power outages. And it seems there's nothing to be done about leaky roofs! I live in an old house. The part I work in has a flat roof and a skylight. Every year we do maintenence, hire roofers, fix the holes, only to find that new leaks sprout. What can I do? Not much. I love the woods, the creek, the live oak trees, the great birds, my garden. A leaky roof seems a small price to pay."/>
			<outline text="Power outages are even more out of my hands. They seem to bunch up at the beginning of the rainy season. During the first few windy storms power outages are a certainty. Trees sway wildly, summer growth that isn't sustainable breaks. It's just a matter of time before one of the branches hits a power line, and boom! out goes the power, and with it my servers. "/>
			<outline text="It happened on Sunday. I was working on a new web application. Tweaking up the HTML. Writing email to people I'm working with, when in an instant, the power goes out. The screens go blank. The fans whirrr down. It gets quiet. I sit there for a moment, stunned. Now I understand why we call these things platforms. The online world is so high. When it disappears, in an instant, I'm left feeling part of the elements. "/>
			<outline text="My first act is one of rebellion. I create a fire in the fireplace. I can't stand the idea that I'm just part of nature. I have to win."/>
			<outline text="Reading a book by  candlelight, heated by fire, listening to the wind and rain instead of Peter Gabriel, I feel disconnected. A few hours later I go for a walk in the rain. I come home, the power is on. "/>
			<outline text="So, if you're trying to get thru to my server at www.scripting.com and can't for a few hours or even a couple of days, you can be sure we're having stormy weather in California. Feel a part of nature when this happens. Share that with me, and know that it's a struggle for me too! "/>
			<outline text="Soon it will be the middle of the rainy season and the power outages will be behind us. I could move the servers to an office? Not this year. Maybe next? We'll see."/>
			<outline text="***Holding on, letting go"/>
			<outline text="The power situation here is nothing and it's everything. Listening to Peter Gabriel sadly sing I love to be loved; it's the same thing. I want power but sometimes it goes away. Your life, mine too, is about holding on and letting go. Back and forth. Over and over. That's where we create our heat, our passion, it's where joy and freedom come from. It's painful. We say hello, we say goodbye, we do it again and again until we die."/>

			<outline text="http://www.minds.com/ "/>
			<outline text="Started by well-known online opionier, Howard Rheingold, Electric Minds raised $2 million from venture capitalists, built a powerful web server and content system, licensed software from The Well, and started a new online community. "/>
			<outline text="Like many well-capitalized startups in the Bay Area, Electric Minds is an experiment, in this case, to see if a growing business can be built around the pure energy of the minds of the people who use the Internet. Rheingold is a natural leader, a man with a big heart and a big mind, and he has lots of friends. I have no doubt that he can make great flow happen on his web server."/>

			<outline text="***Windows outliners"/>
			<outline text="A brief mention of outliners and Windows in &quot;The Arrogance of the Mac&quot; 11/10/96, sparked a bunch of email asking &quot;When?&quot; It seems that some people want a tight fast outliner for Windows. Apparently the suites from Microsoft, Lotus and Corel don't include outliners. I'm surprised by this. People don't enjoy the outliner in Microsoft Word. They ask for something different."/>
			<outline text="On the way to porting our scripting software to Windows, we must produce an outliner because Frontier is built around one. Now I'm thinking of releasing the outliner as a separate product. What do you think? Can we make money in this market? Last time I marketed an outliner, I was told by the industry that it wasn't a category -- that it would be swallowed up by word processors. I don't want to go thru that again! "/>
			<outline text="Please send email if you feel strongly, one way or the other."/>
			<outline text="***BBEdit, CodeWarrior and Frontier"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday the nominations for MacUser's Eddy awards were published. "/>
			<outline text="We made the cut with Frontier 4.1 -- it's a finalist for Best New Development Tool for 1996. I love getting awards... It's the best thing. It takes the burden off of me as a software promoter. You don't have to believe me, check out what they said about us. It lightens the load. And it just plain feeeeeels good. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Our fellow nominees are excellent market-leading products. BBEdit from Bare Bones Software is the best general-purpose HTML editing product, the default web tool in the Macintosh world. Many people who use Frontier for web development started with and still use BBEdit. We've made our products work beautifully together. This is the kind of collaboration I've been dreaming about. A respectful back and forth of ideas and code and trust. The result is harmony and co-existence. It's a nice way to play in the software world!"/>
			<outline text="And Metrowerks CodeWarrior 10 is such a powerhouse. Without CodeWarrior there would be no RISC version of Frontier, and the performance advantage our software enjoys over the competition wouldn't be there. We use both BBEdit and CodeWarrior here at UserLand. They are in no small measure part of the reason *our* product was nominated. "/>
			<outline text="Yay!"/>
			<outline text="***MacWEEK article"/>
			<outline text="I often disagree with Don Crabb, the columnist for MacWEEK. He always tries to solve the Mac community's problems by encouraging Apple to take control of more and more stuff. I think Crabb misses the big picture, that when the platform vendor takes control of a market, the market dies."/>
			<outline text="Crabb has a strong opinion. He evokes my anger. Then I'm surprised when he writes an insightful piece about Frontier and what it does. It's been hard to get the message out that Frontier is a website development system. People understand that Dave is on the web (you do, don't  you?) but people miss the point that my software is here too. "/>
			<outline text="So, thanks to Don Crabb, he got the scoop."/>

			<outline text="***Netscape Constellation"/>
			<outline text="Netscape announced a new technology for &quot;netcasting&quot; called Constellation. It's in the same space as Pointcast, Marimba, Backweb and several others, and embraces technology from Marimba and Pointcast. "/>
			<outline text="Interesting stuff. A hybrid of email and the web. Pushed content that looks beautiful; prettier than email, and unlike the web, it comes to you. You don't have to go get it."/>
			<outline text="We're already working on tools for producing content that flows thru these kinds of channels. If Microsoft and others offer similar technology our tools will be adapted to generate content for them too."/>
			<outline text="It's great for tool vendors when new competing technologies come along, because we can offer choices to developers, hiding the differences where possible, and exploiting the advantages of each approach."/>
			<outline text="***Hancock speaks"/>
			<outline text="Ellen Hancock, Apple's chief technology officer, is starting to speak publicly about Apple and its relationship with Mac developers. In a news.com report she said &quot;We must ruthlessly and relentlessly drive out the 'not invented here' syndrome. Apple is famed for living in its own reality distortion field.&quot;  "/>
			<outline text="It sounds like Hancock is singing the right tune. I'm willing to give her a chance. But..."/>
			<outline text="We heard this sentiment from Apple CEO Gil Amelio in May, in even stronger terms, without historic context, only to have it retracted by Apple vice-presidents and managers and regular employees in the following months. "/>
			<outline text="By the time the Apple organization was finished redefining the Amelio's words, the message had become &quot;Apple will not gratuitously compete with developers,&quot; leaving us to wonder what gratuitous competition is. I asked for an example, none was provided."/>
			<outline text="Then an Apple vice-president said Apple won't compete with developers unless it's in its interests to do so, leaving us to wonder what had changed. In the past, did Apple compete with developers when it *wasn't* in their interest? Why would they do that? "/>
			<outline text="***Does Hancock have teeth?"/>
			<outline text="From time to time, we've heard new Apple execs arrive with a fresh attitude, telling developers what they want to hear, but usually it doesn't last long. In the end, they tell Apple internal people what *they* want to hear, and end up chasing their tails around the infinite loop. "/>
			<outline text="***Does the Mac have a future?"/>
			<outline text="But it's expensive and time-consuming and painful to switch platforms, especially for developers, so a lot of people don't switch and would prefer to believe the Mac has a future even when many people believe it doesn't."/>
			<outline text="Personally, I believe there is a sustainable position for the Mac platform, but the position must be relative to the dominant Windows platform. This is far from impossible, but it requires courage and the willingness to conceive of Apple as a much smaller company with developers playing a much larger role."/>
			<outline text="***Can we have a demo?"/>
			<outline text="So I, and perhaps others, would like to know what Ms. Hancock plans to do to be sure that Apple employees get the message this time. Is Apple willing to promote developer products? Will they lend their brand name and their web flow and FTP sites to let people know that some of the best products in the software world still run only on the Mac platform?"/>
			<outline text="Can we have a demo of Hancock's new Apple? More than words. Give us something that shows that the company has learned, is willing to accept a smaller role for itself, and is willing to acknowledge the power of others. "/>
			<outline text="I want Apple to market and promote our products instead of theirs. I feel they've done enough to promote their own stuff. Now it's our turn. It's pretty simple. We have so much more than they do. Apple must work for us, not the old way, where they assumed (and said so publicly!) that our work was inadequate and difficult, and theirs elegant. The opposite was true. I want to see Apple people have the courage to take a real look."/>
			<outline text="Hancock has committed to undoing the system. There's no time to waste and no shortcuts possible. Maybe Hancock is the right person to make Apple grow up and get real? I'm willing to give her a chance, but my eyes will stay open and so will my options. "/>

			<outline text="I have a new website to announce this morning, and a new development in the web server market to discuss."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft buys a web server"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has acquired two products from a small Berkeley software company, ResNova, http://www.resnova.com/, and hired the development team that was working on the software. "/>
			<outline text="The products are WebForOne and Boulevard, low-end and high-end web servers for the Macintosh. "/>
			<outline text="The Mac web server market is moving quickly. Quarterdeck shipped WebSTAR 2.0 last week, with a myriad of new features, including a built-in Java Runtime, which presents an interesting opportunity for cross-platform Java developers. "/>
			<outline text="The Microsoft deal realigns the flow of power in the Mac web community, and begins what's sure to be a struggle for leadership between Quarterdeck (which is crippled by financial problems) and Microsoft (which is not). Apple figures in here somewhere."/>
			<outline text="Up till now, the clear leader in this market has been WebSTAR, with Apple waiting in the wings with an almost-announced low-end product. Microsoft says that it plans to market the low-end product only, but the dividing line of the feature sets will be interesting to watch as their software evolves. What interfaces will they support or not support? Can we achieve tighter integration with content tools and scripting systems? It seems natural that Microsoft's web server will conform to the Denali spec, and ActiveX will fit in here somewhere."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft continues to hire the best Mac people. Congratulations to Alex Hoppman and and the other Resnovas, I think the move makes sense for them. I've used WebForOne. It's excellent software. I'm sure they'll continue to kick butt now that they work for Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="And, since Microsoft plans to give away the server software, as it does with its client, it clearly must be seen as a strategic move, not a way to gain revenue. "/>
			<outline text="Interesting!"/>
			<outline text="***The Classified Ads Server"/>
			<outline text="On Friday we opened a new website -- a Classified Ads server. It's halfway between a Guestbook and a BBS. It's software that you can use to broadcast your wants. In a civilized way, of course. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="The new server is at http://www.scripting.com/ads/. It's reasonably self-explanatory. While others may focus in other areas (we plan to offer the software for sale), our server specializes in the job market for web developers. So, if you have a job for a web master, designer, author, CGI script writer, Java appleteer, PhotoShop bitboy (or girl!), or some other position related to building and maintaining websites, please post an ad on the server. If you're looking for such a job, you can broadcast your wants too. And if you have a product or service to offer, please check out the Announcements category."/>
			<outline text="The site explains more. It's designed to be easy to navigate, not overwhelming or complex, and visually pleasing. I hope the web community uses this new resource. Ads are free during the startup period. We may charge a reasonable fee for ad placement as the service grows."/>

			<outline text="***Bury the Web, Part II"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;The Little Bird&quot;, 6/26/95, I asked for a time capsule for the web. &quot;I'd like to participate in a quick project to freeze the worldwide web on January 1, 1996, back it up, and bury the hard disk. Transmit the archive to the nearest solar system that might have intelligent life. Isn't this a neat idea? What do you think? I think it's juicy.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I liked the idea then, and I still do. I was reminded of it reading a piece in Friday's New York Times. Two historians in Maine claim the American Revolution wasn't fought for freedom, it was started because the weather in New England had been bad for 15 years. They cited diaries kept by students for the years leading up to the revolution. "/>
			<outline text="Why were all those students keeping diaries? Because Jonathan Winthrop,  a Harvard professor of the day, asked them to, for history's sake! Wow. They had a historical perspective then. We could have one now. Let's do a backup of the web! "/>
			<outline text="We can all back up our own websites. Let's pick a time to do it. Copy your website to a floppy disk, and put the disk in a safe deposit box, clearly marked as being part of the backup-the-web project. Your heirs can pass it down thru the generations. Uncle Dave was a webmaster! Look kids, here's what he did. My disk could become an heirloom."/>
			<outline text="Even better, the web is actually being backed up every day by the search engines at InfoSeek, Lycos, Yahoo, Excite, Alta Vista, Web Crawler, HotBot, etc. A by-product of their indexing of the web is a full text traversal of all the sites they visit. Any of the search engines could take the high ground and leave a trail for historians to follow. "/>
			<outline text="What great PR it would be! Don't underestimate the vision and imagination of people who write for the web. Someday the historians will ask for it. I am sure of that."/>

			<outline text="It seems that Fred must have been involved in the Clinton campaign of 1992. Now his spirit is guiding me as I get interviewed for end-of-year looking-forward stories that other people are writing. The question goes like this -- what's going to be the hot new technology of 1997? My answer..."/>
			<outline text="***It's HTML, Dummy!"/>
			<outline text="HTML -- everyone does it and everyone hates it. It sucks, but it's what we got. Will its ills be cured? No, it can't happen. It's a standard. It's HTML, dummy, love it or leave it. It's The Big One. "/>
			<outline text="1996 was a crazy year! How many websites went on the air this year? How many messes got created? 1997 will be the year we start to deal with the messes. Every organization that went on the web in a big way in 1996 will have to decide in 1997 whether they're serious or not. Some will give it up, and in their angst there will be a tempation to say that the web is over. But it will not be over."/>
			<outline text="1997 will be the year we get serious about the web. Any organization that produces dynamic content for the web is a newspaper or a magazine, and will have to operate more like a publication and less like a software company, car company, whatever other kind of company they used to be. "/>
			<outline text="In 1996 everyone in every organization wanted to get in the act. In 1997 the webmasters will take charge again, institute systems, get the HTML crap out of the way of marketing people and executives, and the web will become the dynamic all-inclusive medium it's destined to be."/>
			<outline text="***Feminine Energy"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Web Energy&quot; is still very much alive! Oh the bright eyes and the optimism. Librarians and secretaries make it happen. I joke with a librarian turned webmaster: &quot;Librarians are going to run the world, right?&quot; A smile. &quot;We already do,&quot; she says. Very nicely done! "/>

			<outline text="***Wizzy site tools"/>
			<outline text="Wizzy tools are here, but they are the wrong approach. "/>
			<outline text="Ask Walt Mossberg, the software columnist for the Wall Street Journal, who says the software industry can't produce truly easy-to-use site development tools. He's right, but it isn't the industry's fault. I swear, there's no way to do a wizzy tool for this thing. The web is not a wizzy medium. Not. Not. Not."/>
			<outline text="Style on the web moves too fast for wizzy tools like FrontPage, HomePage, PageMill, Fusion, etc. to keep up with. Look at how tools evolved in 1996 for a clue. Frames were a fad, every tool vendor took them seriously and invested. At the end of the year they all produce frame-based sites, but no one wants to produce them anymore! Ooops. "/>
			<outline text="No problem, because as a reading medium, writers actually need the same basic tools they've always needed. Text with very little style. No font changes if you want it to be readable. We can make more powerful tools for web designers and webmasters. For artists and geeks we can go deeper. We can give writers better writing tools, that's all that's needed, and all that's possible."/>
			<outline text="The net-net, as much as I love outliners, the structure of a website is not a hierarchy, and therefore outliners are inadequate editors for the structure of websites."/>
			<outline text="***Graphic tools"/>
			<outline text="Tools for producing web graphics, on the other hand, have a promising future. Right now, it's way too hard, and tool developers *can* do something about this. "/>
			<outline text="Most of the pretty graphics on the web are words rendered beautifully with special effects. To produce such graphics you need years of experience using PhotoShop or Fractal, or something like that. A text enhancer with special effects that was truly easy to use could be the killer app of 1997. I'd be the first in line to buy one."/>
			<outline text="***Client-side includes, again"/>
			<outline text="I got a lot of response for my request for web &quot;client-side includes&quot; in &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot;. People suggested I check out various forms of CGI scripting and smart server software."/>
			<outline text="I was talking about client-side includes, not CGIs. A &lt;i&gt;browser feature&lt;/i&gt; that would allow the web client to assemble a page from standard elements located on different servers, without special server software. Like frames without the awkward user interface. It would give web designers more power, and I think that's a good thing. "/>
			<outline text="If I get the time, I'll post a spec for how this could work, but the developers at the major web browser companies know what I'm talking about, so the need isn't really there. "/>
			<outline text="***Law on the Web"/>
			<outline text="Companies that are log-jammed in legal debates over liability for personal websites will lose the race. Give it up. Put a disclaimer on personal sites if you have to. &quot;This page does not speak for the company. We disclaim it. The opinions here are personal.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Legalese on websites -- a clue! Every external link on http://www.microsoft.com/ has a disclaimer. Fear! Makes me want to use Netscape's site instead, where they point without disclaiming. What do Microsoft's lawyers know that Netscape's lawyers don't?"/>
			<outline text="***Evolution"/>
			<outline text="HTML is a very strong standard. It has evolution problems. Lots of people still use Netscape 2.0, and have no plans on switching to a 3.0 or a 4.0 from Netscape or Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="Tables, blockquote, color, difficult font control, animated GIFs, that's the environment we're designing pages for. Will there be a &quot;killer app&quot; for ActiveX? No, I don't think so. Will Microsoft displace Netscape? No, I don't think so."/>

			<outline text="One of the first DaveNet pieces, &quot;How to Invest in PDAs&quot; 10/14/94 proved to be exactly right. PDAs have become peripheral devices for PCs. Motorola just cancelled their Newton and MagicCap products, neither of which worked well with desktop computers. "/>
			<outline text="The new rage is the US Robotics Pilot PDA, which works great and connects to desktops very well. People who love PDAs love this product. Proof that it's a winner: Microsoft is trying to displace it! Yeah-yeah. But working together is the best defense against monolithicism. The Pilot guys are here to stay. "/>

		<outline text="Does Anyone Own Syntax?" created="12/6/1996;  6:33:57 AM" name="doesAnyoneOwnSyntax" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Does Anyone Own Syntax?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/6/96; 6:33:57 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Let's begin this day with a deep and (I think) important technical and legal question."/>
			<outline text="***Does Anyone Own Syntax?"/>
			<outline text="Here's the question..."/>
			<outline text="If you write a software product that implements a programming language, do you own the syntax of the language? "/>
			<outline text="Here's a case study that illustrates the question. "/>
			<outline text="A fictional developer, Kirk McRay, develops a new web server add-on that allows web pages to contain short scripts that are evaluated when the pages are served. It's a simple product, it takes Kirk about two months to implement it. "/>
			<outline text="It's released in early 1995, and the product, which sells for $495, catches on with web developers. His company grows to ten people. "/>
			<outline text="One year later, the market has grown, and Kirk's initial design is looking old and out of date. It's become clear how to move forward, but amazingly Kirk treats the product as a cash cow, they aren't updating it, or adding new capabilities."/>
			<outline text="Other developers see an opportunity to add new features, and to undercut Kirk's price, and want to enter this market. Users have a large investment in pages that contain commands in Kirk's language, so they reasonably demand backward compatibility with Kirk's product, to preserve their investment."/>
			<outline text="So Richard, another fictional enterpreneur, decides to add Kirk's syntax to the smart server product he's developing. He used a &quot;clean room&quot; approach, the same one Compaq used to produce a clone of IBM's BIOS in the mid-eighties, making IBM's PC a standard and leading to the PC clone market. "/>
			<outline text="***Richard's Clean Room"/>
			<outline text="Richard hires a consultant, Paul, to study Kirk's product and write a specification and some test pages. When his work is finished, he passes the spec to Richard, and deletes Kirk's product from his hard disk. "/>
			<outline text="Richard is &quot;clean&quot; -- he's never seen the software he's going to emulate. There was no opportunity to reverse-engineer or disassemble it. If there's any copyright infringement, it isn't of the software or the documentation, because he's never seen the docs, or run the software."/>
			<outline text="Richard modifies his product so it conforms to Paul's specification and correctly processes the test pages. When this works, he releases a public beta of the software and announces its availability on several mailing lists that Kirk's customers read. "/>
			<outline text="Within a few days, Richard receives a letter from Kirk's attorney saying that he has violated Kirk's copyrights on the syntax of the language, and that he must immediately stop distributing the software. Damages are claimed. "/>
			<outline text="Richard withdraws the software, not wanting to have his life run by attorneys, and he can't afford the legal fees."/>
			<outline text="***It happens again"/>
			<outline text="It's six months later and another developer, Laura, sees the same opportunity that Richard saw. Kirk now has twenty employees, but still has not substantially revised his software. "/>
			<outline text="The users are trying out other products now, including Laura's, but they still have to run and update Kirk's software because no one else can interpret his syntax. "/>
			<outline text="So, in response to demands from users, Laura applies the same clean-room technique that Richard used, releases the software, and as before, receives a threatening letter from Kirk's attorney. "/>
			<outline text="***My opinion"/>
			<outline text="By asserting ownership of the syntax, Kirk is making his customers pay a higher price than they ever agreed to. "/>
			<outline text="With competition, his $495 price would drop, but the customers also pay in lost time because of incompatibilities. And they pay in missed opportunity, because new features that would keep their websites competitive were never offered to them."/>
			<outline text="Imagine a different scenario, where Kirk updated his product quickly in response to customer needs. It's doubtful if Richard or Laura would have seen an opportunity. "/>
			<outline text="When a vendor views a market as a cash cow, he must be subject to competition. It keeps vendors honest and hardworking, it incentivizes them to invest. Kirk is seeking legal protection to cover up for a lack of responsiveness. He wasn't being competitive, and he's looking to the legal system for justification."/>
			<outline text="I could understand Kirk's objection if Laura and Richard were much larger companies that were offering an inferior product that replaced his. But that's not the case, their products are broader and stronger, more efficient, and lower-priced. Their only desire is to move the market forward, and to be rewarded if they are successful. "/>
			<outline text="The issues that Kirk is dealing with are as old as business itself. To be a successful businessperson, you have to go thru this, rise to the competition. There's nothing wrong with a challenge. If you're a winner, you win. If you're a loser you call an attorney."/>
			<outline text="Competition is an essential element of our economic system. The same laws that apply to giant companies like Microsoft and IBM apply equally to smaller companies who view their markets as captive and not subject to competition."/>
			<outline text="So, for pragmatic, economic and moral reasons, my answer to the question is No. It's not possible to own syntax. "/>
			<outline text="***This isn't academic"/>
			<outline text="The issue is a hot topic in the cross-platform web developer community. The discussion is about the NetCloak product from Maxum Software, http://www.maxum.com/. "/>
			<outline text="Competitors want to add support for NetCloak syntax to other server software, but they have held back, wanting to avoid a legal battle with Maxum."/>
			<outline text="The question has been raised in court, in a 1991 suit filed by Ashton-Tate against Fox Software over the language implemented in Ashton-Tate's dBASE product. "/>
			<outline text="See http://www.lgu.com/cr37.htm for a discussion of this case."/>

			<outline text="Rain rain rain, yes! Lots of rain. The creek behind my house is so swollen. The earth is swollen too. Everything is wet. I sometimes get grouchy this time of year, but I also get excited. Doing many demos, learning a lot, tweaking and developing, re-exploring various technologies. Watching markets develop. People saying yes. Some people say no. Being frustrated and not. The usual mix."/>
			<outline text="To those who miss my DaveNet pieces, and tell me so, that's cooool. The energy flows in different directions sometimes. Last week five projects arrived on my plate, all of them were must-do, the kind of fire-drills that make things happen in the software business. "/>

			<outline text="Onward..."/>
			<outline text="***Java Java Java"/>
			<outline text="We've got a hangover here in NetLand. I'm tired of back-stabbing deals. One week Pointcast is making love with Netscape (sort of) and the next week they're in bed with Microsoft. Can't we just make software and have fun and stop worrying so much about who's killing who?"/>
			<outline text="The faceoff between Netscape and Microsoft is boring. I've asked Microsoft to accept Netscape, but I understand that Netscape has made that difficult. It seems like a lifetime ago (it was earlier this year!) that Netscape officials were predicting that someday people would ask &quot;What was Windows?&quot; the same way they ask &quot;What was VisiCalc?&quot; and &quot;What was 1.2.3?&quot; Microsoft heard that, and decided that a more interesting question would be &quot;What was Netscape?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="They're irreverent at Microsoft, even if the rest of the world worshipped at the Netscape altar, they could prove them wrong. Meet the new boss isn't Microsoft's song. Microsoft is the company that wore T-shirts that said &quot;Delete Philippe&quot; and sure enough, a few years later, Philippe and company appear to be deleted. Live by the sword..."/>
			<outline text="Java Java Java was the rallying cry of the anti-Microsoft rebellion. Wishful thinking on the part of the also-rans. It was too easy for Microsoft to run around them. We saw it coming here in DaveNet. There was no way around it. Microsoft makes good OS! Add a little Java to it, why not, says Microsoft. It works."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime Java says cross-platform and everyone says Yes! They like. Then you ask about the Mac version. Oooops. The Mac is dead, everyone knows that. Why should we make any special effort there? But..."/>
			<outline text="If Java is cross-platform, what's the other platform? Solaris? Hello! Excuse me, but no one in my neighborhood runs Solaris. Yeah, they gave this market to Microsoft. They blame Bill, but they should accept the blame. They gave him the market by blowing off the other platform that lots of people use. "/>
			<outline text="Nuf said on that one."/>
			<outline text="***Accept &amp; Respect"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has so many smart people, but there are more smart people that don't work at Microsoft than do. There's a bigger picture to the net that may be escaping the leaders at Microsoft. It isn't just about technology. The net is much bigger than Microsoft because it gives the power to connect all those smart people that don't work for Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="So far it hasn't happened. The visible leaders of the Microsoft opposition are behaving like little boys in denial -- they don't get that they can't replace Microsoft. But Bill, man, watch out when it dawns on the rest of the world that they don't really need you anymore, no matter what PC WEEK and Newsweek think."/>
			<outline text="Key point -- we never needed the kind of self-centered leadership that Microsoft offers. If we're smart and learn to depend on each other, to remain focused on what each of us does best, and learn to make friendships and build trust among ourselves, we can dig in for a bright future, with or without Microsoft's help."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's strategy is Embrace &amp; Extend. To win, everyone else's strategy has to be Accept &amp; Respect. "/>
			<outline text="Re-align your interests so that when others win, you win. Be compatible, don't try to be monolithic, or put yourself at the center. You can't do everything and the world doesn't revolve around you. Talk, but listen too. There are smart people who can help you, but only if you accept them and respect them."/>
			<outline text="To Microsoft, it's going to be difficult to embrace and extend here. To embrace our power? Hmmm. To extend it? We'll see! (No way...) The deals they're cutting these days are steeped in intrigue. According to Microsoft's real plan, will there be a Pointcast Network two years from now? No, of course not. Are they secretly wearing T-shirts that say Delete Java? Yes, I think they are."/>
			<outline text="If one day, the smart people didn't want to have their future determined by Microsoft, we could decide not to have our future determined by Microsoft. It's that simple. If you choose to view yourself as Microsoft-dominated, you will be. If you choose not to be, you won't."/>
			<outline text="***My bet could be yours"/>
			<outline text="I'm betting that the web developer market is a huge growth area. I'm betting on their independence, that if given a choice, they will go with someone other than Microsoft, as long as they get what they want. I'm committed to always having the best technology, and to being a place where great technologists love to bring their most creative ideas and energy."/>
			<outline text="If you run a technology company and you agree with the paragraph above, then we can work together. And further, I think you'll win. You will have my respect and the respect of others, because your approach empowers me and others. You can have healthy friendships. You won't need to let Microsoft have your market. No lawyers! Just one thing. Respect."/>

			<outline text="I've also been watching carefully as the web content tools market develops. I've been drawing conclusions, and wanted to share them with DaveNet readers."/>
			<outline text="***Four markets"/>
			<outline text="I've identified four markets in web content tools so far, I believe each area will be populated with different kinds of software. It's a marketing thing. Different approaches for different kinds of users and websites. "/>
			<outline text="The four markets are small-sites, designers, writers and geeks."/>
			<outline text="***Small-sites"/>
			<outline text="Software in this category is for small business owners, solo entrepreneurs, families with websites, individuals who are writing all the copy on the website, or are able to edit all the copy. "/>
			<outline text="I expect that Claris and Microsoft will be leaders in this market; especially Claris, since small business is their special expertise, and they already have a strong position with FileMaker. "/>
			<outline text="Akimbo Systems has a nice product named Globetrotter that's doing well in this market too."/>
			<outline text="***Designers"/>
			<outline text="I think designers will like NetObjects Fusion. It's a beautiful rendering of a page editor. It's the first product I've seen that takes the designers interests to heart. They position themselves as the Quark XPress of the web, and they're right to do that. But the HTML it generates is wild! With some help from the browser makers, they should be able to make simpler HTML do the same stuff."/>
			<outline text="***Writers"/>
			<outline text="So far no one has offered a writer's tool designed for web writing. Most page editors don't even have a spell-checker. There's room for lots of innovation here. Text is more structured on the web. The major new thing web writers have to worry about -- hyperlinks. "/>
			<outline text="So far the focus in webwriting tools has been on making HTML manageable, but these products are actually more useful to geeks. They're not really writing tools, just early releases in the small-site segment. In the future, HTML will not be an issue for writers. They won't write in HTML, they'll write in English, Spanish, French or Chinese."/>
			<outline text="***Geeks"/>
			<outline text="If you don't want a cookie-cutter website, you need an empowered geek to make text flow thru templates and scripts out to the site. But the geek isn't going to design your templates, or write the copy. So if your website isn't a single-practitioner thing, webflow is already the big issue. What was fun in 1996 will be a lot of work in 1997. Effective websites will be managed systems. "/>
			<outline text="Tools for designers, writers and geeks must work together, systematically. Just as there's a position for design tools like Quark Xpress, there's also a need for powerful webflow system software."/>
			<outline text="***Webflow"/>
			<outline text="I'll never grok Photoshop or Quark, so I doubt if Fusion will be my primary HTML generating tool. Designers and writers will never work in a Microsoft or Symantec development environment, nor should they use my software to manage their websites. Most writers don't want to manage websites, but they want control of the copy on the pages they're responsible for. "/>
			<outline text="Think webflow and you'll understand how content tools will evolve over the next few years. It's going to be a segmented market. I don't think any one company or product can dominate all four segments, because different groups view software differently and have different, conflicting, needs. The key is making the tools work together so the users can work together."/>
			<outline text="***We work together"/>
			<outline text="Good news! Everybody already works together because there's a strong standard file format out there, HTML. My software can organize files written in any of the page editors, you can even mix them, because they all produce output that's viewable in a web browser. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;crock&quot;&gt;I can&lt;/a&gt; read files produced by Fusion, Home Page, any of them -- and I didn't have to work with the developers at any of the companies.

			<outline text="***Your custom cookie-cutter"/>
			<outline text="I'm interested in the breakdown of the content tools market so I can better understand how to position my product and company. Having established a framework, it's easier to say what my software does. "/>
			<outline text="I've come to think of Frontier as a web operating system. It builds on top of a desktop OS, whether it be Windows or Macintosh, or Be OS or Unix. Desktop systems deal with a lower level of problems -- applications, files, folders, network connections, shared resources."/>
			<outline text="We manage resources at a higher level: object-oriented structures of text, outlines, scripts, data, and access to content produced by other applications. We render text into web pages; structures of web pages into web sites. It's all subject to modification and customization thru macros and templates. Links are stored in hierarchic symbol tables. Relative links are generated with no extra work. You never have to put a hard-coded URL into a web page. "/>
			<outline text="We go for maximum power for the geek, so they can create an easy-to-use platform for writers and designers. It's the lathe on which developers design the custom cookie-cutter that defines a powerful easy-to-use website."/>

			<outline text="Bill Gates has a vision -- Information at Your Fingertips. It's a good idea to have a slogan to explain what you're doing.

Our little company is just a Large Dynamic Site, and thanks to our community -- it has lots of authors."/>
			<outline text="***LTODBS"/>
			<outline text="I've never written about this in DaveNet, but it's becoming a hot issue in the web community, so it's time. "/>
			<outline text="LTODBS stands for Low-Tech Object Distribution Server. Late last year we experimented with a high-tech server, and discovered that low-tech was better. "/>
			<outline text="The LTODBS is a distribution system for new innovations built for the Frontier platform. It's a distributed website with a backbone. If you're interested in the culture of object distribution, this is a mature system that works."/>

			<outline text="But what about Killer Tags? No one thinks in these terms because so few of us have the opportunity to create one."/>

			<outline text="Progress matters more than process.  Stay focused on moving forward."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;theKillerTagItself&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;include&lt;/a&gt;&gt;"/>
			<outline text="A few issues back I started a discussion on a simple new tag for HTML that could revolutionize web authoring, making it easier to separate form from content, avoiding the use of frames, which, in my opinion, cripple the user interface of websites. "/>
			<outline text="Here's the goal. The ideal web page should look good and be easy to maintain. The content can change easily, so can the look. As discussed previously, look and content are the respective provinces of designers and writers. Few designers, lots of writers. One design, with variables, lots of pages. Change the design and the look of all the pages changes. "/>
			<outline text="I'm looking for the logical effect of frames, without crippling the UI. Here's how. Define a new tag &amp;lt;include src=&quot;url&quot;&gt;. When the client encounters one of these, it forks off a new HTTP request, gets the response and inserts it into the text for the page. Pages assemble dynamically. The designer can change the template without coordinating with the writers. The look of a site can be transformed with a single upload. "/>
			<outline text="When I floated this idea I heard that people think this should be done at the server, but I disagree. Been there, done that. The problem is that such systems are easy to set up, but hard to maintain. You can't move files to a different server without moving software. When you set up your content with such a fragile system, guess what -- it breaks!"/>
			<outline text="It's been a while since we've had huge easy new power in the web. It'd be fun, I think. How about it Netscape?"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/midas/clientIncludes.html "/>
			<outline text="***Fusion starts an interesting discussion"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday's piece, &quot;A Custom Cookie-Cutter&quot; got a fair response that the web is not a graphics environment, and that NetObjects Fusion takes it places it was never designed to go."/>
			<outline text="One designer writes &quot;Unfortunately, Fusion fools designers into thinking that they have absolute control over the layout of a page. Just try changing the font size on a Fusion-authored page and it turns into a mess.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I think this is true. But I also think that Netscape is paying attention, and will add tags to their browser to support the layout features that Fusion users desire. "/>
			<outline text="Here's how it would work. A page becomes a cartesian plane. Bits of text and graphics and code place themselves in specific locations. Some objects can already have height and width, all that's needed is top and left."/>
			<outline text="It's not rocket-science. Draw programs work this way, as do page layout programs. So does Windows and the Mac OS. People who use Quark XPress and PageMaker could do a Save-as and produce reasonable web content. This would open up the web to a new kind of designer. A few months after such a feature shipped in browsers and content tools, you'd see a flood of new beautifully-laid-out text on the web in surprising places."/>
			<outline text="People who use teletype-oriented terminal programs will object that this would make the web less usable for them. But we made the leap to graphic systems a full generation ago! Some people I work with, in their twenties now, have never used anything but graphic systems. Do we still have to be tied to the realities of the leading edge twenty years past? I guess you know how I feel about this. Onward! I say."/>
			<outline text="***Gillmore rants on standards"/>
			<outline text="John Gillmore, gnu@toad.com, a man who's no stranger on DaveNet, had an enthusiastic response to my comments about the value of the HTML standard:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;This is exactly how the whole cooperative thing we call the Internet came into being.  Why does everything talk IP and TCP and Telnet? Because we wrote a spec (an RFC) and people implemented to it.  And we worked out any glitches we found, in later RFCs."/>
			<outline text="&quot;This is quite a bit different from the 'one vendor implements it and the others reverse-engineer and clone it' model of the PC industry. It allows for give-and-take and evolution. And since all the parties are cooperating to build solid specs, rather than hiding their work so that others must re-do it, it proceeds faster to a better consensus. This works because the parties realize that it is in their best interest to make all their products talk to each other."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Microsoft has not learned this yet, despite what their marketing people tell you about how they really love the Internet. Where's the RFC on the Word document format? Where's the documentation for the new DNS records they squirt around? Why do they only release specs for their interfaces (API's) after they implement and release them?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;They're intent on selling you their product because you have no other credible choice, not because it's the best.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Compaq of ISPs"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;The Compaq of ISPs&quot;, 7/31/96, I wrote about my frustration with the lack of quality and professionalism, and disorderly growth, in the ISP market. "/>
			<outline text="I asked for an ISP who could promise transparent uptime, notification of planned outages, have a plan for growth that would assure continued good performance, and respect my professionalism at all times. I had lots of choices after writing that piece."/>
			<outline text="I chose Conxion, a San Jose ISP, for several reasons. First, I noticed that Microsoft is using them. When you download something from www.microsoft.com, you see a Conxion graphic next to the link. It looks good. And when you click on the link you get a fast download! Yeah, that's what I like. "/>
			<outline text="Conxion's president, Antonio Salerno, antonio@conxion.com, is in my loop. We've spoken several times. He's a DaveNet reader, and a contributor. He's a smart high-energy guy, with lots of experience in the software business. And I believe he totally understood what I was asking for. "/>
			<outline text="So, we ordered a full T1-connection from Conxion, the equivalent of 24 ISDN lines. A couple of weeks ago it came up. On 12/6/96 I sent an email to Antonio: &quot;We're still having some problems with routers and hubs. It's been a bunch of work, but your guys still keep exceeding any reasonable expectations of patience, maturity, good vibes. Congrats Antonio, you have some great people. That's totally key, per the Compaq of ISPs thing.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Now all the glitches are out. My ISDN router is still turned on, but no computers are hooked into it. I'm putting up my own DNS and mail server. Thinking about getting more computers. I bought another hub. Lots of blue sky. It's exciting! "/>
			<outline text="One question remains, though -- how will we handle growth? Conxion is growing, so is UserLand. As we go forward, will professionalism and good vibes remain? Are they the Compaq of ISPs? I think they're a good start. I'm going to work with them, and help them define it, from the customer side of the equation. I'm optimistic!"/>

			<outline text="***Glass Palaces"/>
			<outline text="Back in the old days of computing, we connected via phone lines to huge banks of computers that lived behind glass, in air-conditioned environments, with raised floors to hide the wires, and engineers who wore white shirts and ties and got regular haircuts. That's the world I grew up in."/>
			<outline text="But I had a basic misunderstanding, as a longtime online user, that the computer at the other end of the pipe had to be something big. This is the basic revelation of the Internet. You can have a Compuserve-like presence, but you don't need a palace of glass to do that anymore."/>
			<outline text="But, I've found it necessary, for my psychological safety, to set up my own glass palace. For a long time I had the www.scripting.com server on the same table as my main desktop machine. Now that I'm running a T1 line and getting a lot more traffic, I need the illusion of glass. "/>
			<outline text="There's a single black wire that goes over the wall, on the other side of that wire is my virtual world, the one you visit. My files travel over that wire using the same protocols, but my peace of mind comes from wearing a different hat when I'm doing server stuff. "/>
			<outline text="I get out of my chair, enter another room, my own personal glass palace. A different kind of chaos reigns there. I get a spiritual haircut when I enter that room! It's coool."/>
			<outline text="***Outliners for HTML"/>
			<outline text="Back to the chaos of content... On 11/18/96 I tried out something new, it worked spectacularly, and now a month later, it's stood the test of time, it'll be included in the next release of our website framework, and I wanted to point web developers at the idea before releasing the implementation publicly."/>
			<outline text="The idea is simple -- web pages are hiearchies. Tables nested inside tables nested inside of a list inside of a blockquote inside a table, inside the body of the page. For some reason, until I saw the demo of Microsoft's Trident environment, I hadn't understood this, or focused on it. "/>
			<outline text="Hey -- when I see a hierarchy I think of outliners! So I tried doing a web page in Frontier's outliner and wrote a renderer script called &quot;New Culture&quot; that does a simple traversal, producing tab-indented HTML source. "/>
			<outline text="You can see the resulting HTML by viewing-source on most pages on the www.scripting.com website. I'm using it everywhere. When I convert templates from flat text to outlines I find and fix bugs. I see immediate opportunities for improvement. The idea has made a big difference for me, maybe it will for others too."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/19/96; 7:00:38 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="John Shoch, shoch@assetman.com, a former Xerox exec, ran the division that produced the Xerox Star, the earliest graphic desktop system. Many of the ideas behind the software we use today came from innovations at Xerox. "/>
			<outline text="Shoch is a computer scientist, executive and most recently a venture captialist at Asset Management in Palo Alto. He has a lot of experience with intellectual property in software, and has strong opinions on whether syntax can or should be copyrightable. "/>
			<outline text="This essay came in response to my &quot;Does Anyone Own Syntax?&quot; 12/6/96."/>
			<outline text="***John Shoch on Clean Rooms"/>
			<outline text="Tangible property is easy to protect because it is, well, tangible.  You can lock it up, and you can tell when it has been stolen. Intangible propery is hard to protect. You can steal an idea or copy a song, but the original owner does not know that it is gone. "/>
			<outline text="Computer software is not the first form of valuable intellectual property -- our IP laws go back centuries."/>
			<outline text="Patents provide protection for an underlying idea, independent of any particular representation, with the limit that the idea be new, non-obvious, and useful. "/>
			<outline text="Copyrights provide protection for a particular representation, but not an underlying abstraction or idea. "/>
			<outline text="You can get a patent on the idea behind a transistor design. You can get a copyright on the artwork for a particular silicon implementation. You may need a license to the patent on the idea, in order to implement your copyrighted design. "/>
			<outline text="If you have either a patent or a copyright, you can decide if you want to share these with others freely, license them, or keep them proprietary. Your choice may determine your personal satisfaction, or your economic success, but it is your choice."/>
			<outline text="***AT&amp;T and Polaroid"/>
			<outline text="AT&amp;T decided to license the patent on the transistor, not seeing it as part of their core business. We could argue about the ultimate economic effect, but it was their choice. They would have been well within their rights to keep the patent, and do the investment to exploit it on their own, thus monopolizing this invention. That's the purpose of the patent law. "/>
			<outline text="Polaroid patented many aspects of instant film, chose not to license it, and invested substantial amounts to take it to market. Kodak later tried to enter this field, and lost a massive patent suit. That was good for the Polaroid shareholders and bad for the Kodak shareholders. As much as we all liked instant film, however, Polaroid was under no obligation to license it just because we might have wanted cheaper film."/>
			<outline text="***The PTO got started late"/>
			<outline text="Unfortunately, the IP laws have had some serious problems when applied to software. In the 1970s and 80s the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) would not grant patents on ideas to be embodied in software, thinking of them as being only abstract ideas like mathematical formulas, and not eligible for patent protection.  "/>
			<outline text="At Xerox, for example, we could get a patent on innovative hardware, such as the ball mouse, but not on the software. Thus, at that time we could not even apply for a patent on the new, innovative ideas which were the result of years of labor: the desktop metaphor, symbolic icons, multiple hierarchical windows, WYSIWYG editing.  "/>
			<outline text="We should have been able to patent these broader ideas, independent of their specific implementations, be it in Smalltalk, Bravo, Alto OS, Star, Mac, Windows. So we were only left with the alternative of seeking copyright protection on the specific representation -- the code and the visual displays. That stopped someone from copying the code, but did not stop anyone from copying the ideas and implementing them slightly differently."/>
			<outline text="I view it as one of the major tragedies of the computer era that the PTO took such a narrow view during that time, depriving many imaginative individuals, and their employers and shareholders, of the protection their ideas deserved. More recently, the PTO started accepting patent applications for ideas embodied in software, but it was too late to protect the earlier work."/>
			<outline text="***Some unfortunate slips"/>
			<outline text="Because of their late start in allowing patents on software, the PTO has let some unfortunate ones slip through. When a patent examiner looks at a patent application, his major source for evaluation is the prior collection of patents. Thus, some examinations have allowed patents on things which were actually subject to extensive prior art, but were not in the patent files. These are mistakes, which can sometimes be corrected, but it is an expensive nuisance. "/>
			<outline text="Some people, however, have seen this happen and then claim that we should not allow patents on ideas relating to software. I think that is wrong -- we just need to stamp out the spurious patents which are not genuinely new. The community needs to rally to help strike some of these down, but also come to the aid of those who have patented something truly new and different."/>
			<outline text="There has emerged a gray area between patented ideas and copyrighted representations. Consider a research team that spends a year exploring alternative user interfaces and command sequences. They run detailed experiments, watch subjects, and identify a set of command sequences which clearly reduce confusion and produce a new, better UI.  But this may not meet the test for an &quot;idea&quot; that can be patented, nor a representation which can be copyrighted. "/>
			<outline text="***Is syntax copyrightable?"/>
			<outline text="Your question about syntax falls into this category -- how do you protect a grammar for a new language? Is it a protectable idea? Is it copyrightable? In this situation, many people have tried to stretch the notion of copyright protection to cover these forms of behavior or interfaces.  "/>
			<outline text="The most notable example in this category, I think, is PostScript. Developed by Adobe, it's a description language for documents, defined by a grammar. I don't believe that it qualified for patent protection, but their specific implementation of a PostScript interpreter is covered by copyright. "/>
			<outline text="Adobe invested heavily to make the best PostScript interpreters, and got most of the printer manufacturers to buy their proprietary code. Some manufacturers tried to develop their own independent document formats (e.g., H-P), while others have implemented and sold independent PostScript interpreters."/>
			<outline text="As one who is generally supportive of providing protection for intellectual creativity, I am sympathetic with efforts to protect this kind of work. But I know it's a grey area. If you can get broad patent or copyright protection, more power to you.  If not, you will face more intense competition."/>
			<outline text="If you build a better widget, and customers are willing to pay for it, that's to your credit. If you get a patent on your widget, others can't copy it, and customers can only buy it from you. That's what Polaroid did with instant film, and Kodak got clobbered when they infringed on those patents. "/>
			<outline text="If you can lock your customers in, that's a testimonial to your creativity. But if you price it too high then they will go somewhere else, or abandon the product (look what 1-hour developing has done to Polaroid). You can make an enlighted judgement that, in the long run, you will grow the market much larger if you license your rights (as Xerox did with Ethernet), but that's a decision to be made by the innovator."/>
			<outline text="If someone is inflexible with their approach, go work on something different, which will be better. If you can't dislodge them, then their lock-in strategy has worked, to their benefit and the benefit of their shareholders. Buy their stock, or buy something else, or else just don't use it."/>
			<outline text="***What would Disney think?"/>
			<outline text="Some people try to step around copyrights with the notion of a &quot;clean-room copy&quot;.  This seems to have survived legal examination, but does not seem at all right."/>
			<outline text="Consider this scenario:  I decide I want to create a new cartoon character, a mouse with big ears. So I sit in a room with pictures of Mickey Mouse, and I write a textual &quot;spec&quot; for my new character. Draw a mouse with round eyes about so big, and a nose like this, etc. "/>
			<outline text="Then I toss this written spec into a clean room, where there's an artist who has never seen a Mickey Mouse cartoon. He takes my spec, draws a mouse, and passes it back to me. I tell him to put the eyes closer together, add a tail, etc. "/>
			<outline text="After some number of iterations, we now have our new mouse -- one who looks just like Mickey! But the artist never saw the copyrighted image of Mickey, he &quot;independently&quot; produced it."/>

So, if you're thinking about buying a Macintosh this weekend, consider holding off until you get assurance from Apple management that it's committed to offering a smooth economic ride to its users. "/>
			<outline text="And even then, you should take the promises with a grain of salt. Apple's track record in preserving its customers investment in hardware is spotty. They make money selling hardware, so have limited incentive to bring the old stuff along. "/>
			<outline text="The Macintosh you buy today could be a lame duck, or &quot;an elected official whose term extends beyond the time of the election at which he was not reelected.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="***Remembering Osborne"/>
			<outline text="I wonder if Amelio and his team have heard of a company called Osborne that disappeared overnight because they got too excited about a future that was too far off?"/>
			<outline text="***A proving ground"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to feel good about building systems around Macintoshes, but I don't. Apple finally lost me. What an awful place to be, wanting to invest, but being undermined by the company that stands to gain the most from that investment."/>
			<outline text="Today I view the Mac platform as a proving ground for new ideas, but not a safe place to introduce commercial software products for customers who deserve assurance that their use of my software has a future. Ask Apple, I must say to my users, if you want to be sure about the future. I can't provide you any assurance. "/>
			<outline text="***What developers will do"/>
			<outline text="I try to imagine what Microsoft's reponse will be. They make a suite of applications for the Macintosh OS called Microsoft Office. Will they commit to converting this suite to run under NextStep?"/>
			<outline text="I imagine that Adobe, which already has an investment in the Next OS (it's built on Display Postscript), views this as very good news, and that you will see Adobe products proudly ported to the new system."/>
			<outline text="***We'll keep going"/>
			<outline text="It was the belief that something like this could happen that prompted me to switch strategies this summer and devote all our attention to going cross-platform with our web development tools. "/>
			<outline text="After I finish this piece I'll spend the rest of the day working on Frontier 4.2 for the Mac. The ideas are portable. We're moving to Microsoft's OS, not Next's. If Apple wants to take advantage of our innovations, and the work of others, they must get a convincing story in place quickly. "/>
			<outline text="Amelio wants to push the story out to early January, perhaps missing the point that developers need to get their stories together too, and further, that reporters are calling right now, and asking what we think, and what we're doing. "/>
			<outline text="With all the confusion in the Mac business, it seems that Apple execs must cancel their holiday plans, and get to work to figure out what's going on, and then communicate it."/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="When I run these pieces, some of the true lame ducks come out of the woodwork and let me have their fantasies. People say that I should drink the Kool Aid and get with the program, but not me. I'd rather switch than go into a self-induced trance. "/>
			<outline text="I've moved away from advising Apple on how to navigate the strategic minefield of the personal computer software business. It was doing no good, no matter what I said or did, Apple sang its own tune, as is their right."/>
			<outline text="But lately, quietly, there have been reconciliations. Apple webmasters are using Frontier to do websites. I'm very pleased with this and I hope they continue to do so. We're responding with new features they need. It's a win-win, our software gets stronger and better adapted, and Apple gets a more dynamic manageable web presence."/>
			<outline text="A couple of weeks ago, I had a private exchange with execs at Apple which led to the opening up of Apple's personal web server software which is due to ship soon. This means that Apple's web server will be able to do more than serve static HTML files from a user's hard disk. "/>
			<outline text="We're supporting Apple's meta-content format, or MCF, in the next version of our content tools. We can do a cross-platform outliner browser for MCF, and plan to do it."/>
			<outline text="All of these are positive signs of a platform developer and a software developer working together in productive ways. But none of these positive signs relieve me from the responsibility for thinking for myself and trying to make sense of what just happened at Apple."/>
			<outline text="Before you judge me on a personal level, check out the facts. I was excited about Apple getting an evangelist like Jobs. I encouraged my friends in the press to spin positive about it. But I've never been a fan of reality-distortion. So these are my thoughts, for the eightieth time, I have no patent on the truth, nor do I claim one."/>
			<outline text="***It's about investment"/>
			<outline text="I was not excited to find out that Jobs has nothing at risk as the platform goes forward. He got a lot of cash in the deal, and apparently no stock. "/>
			<outline text="This puts him at odds with others who have large investments in the Mac platform. He can afford to recommend tossing all the cards in the air. If you have an an investment in the Mac platform, they're your cards he could be tossing. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, if Jobs got Apple stock instead of cash, it would alleviate a lot of the concern. Otherwise, he seems to have little at stake in the outcome of the Macintosh platform."/>
			<outline text="***A pyramid of investment"/>
			<outline text="I see a pyramid, with the smallest investment at the top, with Apple's shareholders. Then come the developers, but even our investment in the platform is small compared to the investment of the installed base of users. "/>
			<outline text="It's true, as some have pointed out, that you can install the current OS on all kinds of hardware, some dating back to the mid 1980s. This is an admirable investment-preserving track record. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, every time there's a transition in the OS, we lose some software, and have to reinvest to stay in the same place. Sometimes developers fail to make the transition, and there's no opportunity for users to reinvest. There's no option but losing in that case."/>
			<outline text="So there's a cost to each upgrade. Given that many Mac developers are devoting more resources to Windows development, there has to be a lot of excitement about a new Apple platform to encourage another round of investment by developers. "/>
			<outline text="The excitement wasn't there when Next was independent. Can Apple buying Next really make that much of a difference?"/>
			<outline text="***The best scenario"/>
			<outline text="OK, let's assume the best, that the Next OS with full Mac OS compatibility, ships in 1997. It installs smoothly on all earlier PowerMacs. 68K users are assured that System 7 will be kept current with bugfixes and performance improvements for the forseeable future. There's an easy path for developers to work with both levels of Apple operating systems."/>
			<outline text="Apple offers a new box that's tuned to run the new OS. $2500, with a big hard drive, big screen, lots of RAM and a great net connection. It runs all the Mac software you have plus some new applications that truly take advantage of the new OS. "/>
			<outline text="Here's a holiday toast -- let's hope that Apple delivers and that the users are excited about this idea and buy lots of machines!"/>
			<outline text="***Plan Be"/>
			<outline text="Personally, I like what Be is doing. I encourage other developers who feel the same to continue to explore the new operating system that Be is developing. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.be.com/ "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: If you've used Next's WebObjects product, I would be interested in hearing how it works, if you're satisfied with it, if it's moving, performs well, etc. I admit I haven't been following this software. I'd like to know more about it. Thanks!"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/23/96; 3:50:31 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I just attended the Apple press conference discussing the plans around the acquisition of Next, Inc. My notes from the conference are on the DaveNet website at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/misc/appleConf.html "/>
			<outline text="The major surprise from the conference is that the initial release of the new operating system will not run Macintosh applications. "/>
			<outline text="Apple is committed to moving System 7 forward, with releases in January and July, and is encouraging developers to continue to work with the Macintosh APIs. "/>
			<outline text="The new operating system will run on PowerPCs, it's unclear if it will run on 68K machines."/>
			<outline text="Next has a small installed base of users, numbering in the several hundreds."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="Apple's committment to technologies such as QuickDraw GX is unclear. Hancock pointed out that to protect the secrecy of the negotiations they didn't involve all the necessary groups inside Apple, and will determine the answers to many of the questions early in the year. Many questions were answered this way."/>
			<outline text="It was an interesting experience outlining the proceedings in real time. I posted a notice of it on the News page and many people tuned in while it was going on! Very coool beans."/>
			<outline text="I see opportunities in the new Apple system. I see some products gaining in power, and others diminishing. I like Hancock, and the way she speaks. It's reassuring to know that an intelligent thoughtful person is in a responsible position at Apple."/>
			<outline text="I'm not clear whether they truly understand what WebObjects is, or if we misunderstand. They seem to be placing a lot of emphasis on technology that's not particularly unique, especially in the Macintosh server/content tools market."/>

			<outline text="I find it troublesome. I've given them the rallying cry! Some say -- Dave, drink the Kool Aid. OK. As usual, people are responding to facts not in evidence. No matter. Next subject!"/>
			<outline text="***WebObjects"/>
			<outline text="WebObjects is a CGI development environment built around Objective C and Next's application framework. "/>
			<outline text="Its strengths are the strengths of NextStep, connections to databases, corporate networks. Very high pricetag, but that could change with Apple ownership. I was concerned that it could upset the cart in the Macintosh web content/server market, but I'm not concerned now. "/>
			<outline text="See http://www.scripting.com/davenet/mail/msg0174.html for an analysis."/>
			<outline text="***Developers"/>
			<outline text="I spoke with a few developers over the weekend and received email from many more. There's confusion in the cross-platform developer community. So far no one knows what Apple wants us to do. We're accustomed to a rough ride, but this is rougher than usual."/>
			<outline text="***Be versus Next"/>
			<outline text="It seems that Be would have been a better fit for Apple, given the Mac's large role as a multimedia development machine. In choosing Next over Be, Apple will compete directly with Windows NT. "/>
			<outline text="No matter how it plays it out, it seems that Apple inherits the strategy of the company it acquired. Be would have been a better choice because it plays into Apple's strengths. It's not clear that Next does, perhaps quite the opposite. "/>
			<outline text="***Other theories"/>
			<outline text="A rumor is flying around that Microsoft is buying Be. I don't think it's true."/>
			<outline text="Another story, perhaps with more substance, is that Apple is buying Next as part of a strategy to position itself to be acquired by Sun or IBM. Since both these companies have at different times licensed Next's software, I discount the idea, there's nothing new here. "/>
			<outline text="But I don't discount the idea that Apple is positioning itself to be acquired. There's too much history and momentum behind that idea for it to be completely false at this time."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/24/96; 8:26:54 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="I'm glad I work for a publication with a very short lead-time! I hope this doesn't sound too cliche, but the Internet changes the way writers work. For example, yesterday afternoon, I rushed to get my report on Apple's press conference onto the net. It took 20 minutes, from the end of the conference to a report in DaveNet subscribers' mailboxes. Only radio or TV could have done it more quickly. This makes me want to do radio or TV. I like instant news and opinion."/>
			<outline text="I can't beat other media every time. I tuned into this story because I have contacts at Apple and elsewhere in the software industry. But the Internet reaches everywhere, into every profession, human activity, all our passions and obsessions. With a little more organization, information will flow faster over the new wires, and in a much more diverse pattern."/>
			<outline text="At 5:55:44 PM on Friday, we had confirmation of the Apple/Next deal. I heard radio reports on the Apple/Next deal while I was driving to the Apple press conference a half hour later. I look forward to the day when I hear on the radio &quot;According a report on DaveNet...&quot; Don't laugh! Oh go ahead. It's OK."/>
			<outline text="I heard complaints from people who believe that I should have waited. My opinions can change as new facts come into evidence, and as I learn. DaveNet has always been a medium of real-time learning. If I waited until I was sure about everything it wouldn't be interesting. I'd never get to say anything!"/>
			<outline text="An Apple PR person exclaims: &quot;We announced an acquisition, not an OS strategy!&quot; Yes, that's true, but it suggested a new OS strategy, and without details, there's certain to be speculation. It's not wrong. It's the way human beings process big changes."/>
			<outline text="***It parses better now"/>
			<outline text="What happened? "/>
			<outline text="We've just seen a huge shift in the power structure in the Mac community, a smaller shift in the larger software world. In the transition, new fortunes are possible. I had to nail a few things down before it was clear how to proceed. In the last few DaveNets I asked enough questions and received enough answers so I think I have it much better parsed now."/>
			<outline text="When I thought I understood, I read Henry Norr's column on the MacWEEK website that was posted late yesterday afternoon. Henry had been digging very thoroughly, no surprise there, and provided important information that I didn't have at that time. Henry, thank you very much. "/>
			<outline text="A link to Norr's piece is on my &quot;News &amp; Updates&quot; page."/>
			<outline text="I've been emailing with engineers at Next. It's pretty clear at this point what WebObjects is and isn't. It's also clear what the transition will look like. "/>
			<outline text="First, a caveat -- this is just a story. It's based on information provided by other sources as assimilated by me. If any of the facts are wrong, the conclusions will be wrong too. But, for the most part, my conclusions are based on unequivocal statements from Apple people, so I give them a high degree of reliability. Even so, a grain of salt, please."/>
			<outline text="Here goes!"/>
			<outline text="***It's a new API"/>
			<outline text="NextStep is Apple's operating system. Get used to that idea. "/>
			<outline text="Apple is transitioning to this system with the same degree of committment with which Microsoft switched to the Win32 API over the last few years. With an eye towards the past, the investments already made, they must carefully manage the installed base of applications and users thru what must be a multiple-year transition."/>
			<outline text="There will be an initial Apple release of the NextStep system to give developers something to shoot for. It will behave almost exactly like the system software that Next is currently shipping -- so much so that developers can start developing for NextStep right now and be on the path to compatibility with Apple's operating system. A subsequent release of NextStep will be able to run Macintosh software."/>
			<outline text="Technical realities will make the transition happen slowly. Someone is going to have to figure out how to map QuickDraw onto Display Postscript, or vice versa. That could be Apple, or it could be every developer, or maybe Metrowerks or Symantec can help. "/>
			<outline text="Objective C is going to be a problem. Few developers have learned it. Next is the only platform that uses it as its system development language. This tilts the table in favor of higher-level systems such as Java, JavaScript, VB-Script, and our own Frontier. For such systems, a single port moves a lot of software across. It makes lots of economic sense, if you assume the new platform is going to make it. Also consider that today's CPUs run at much higher clock rates, so the cost of interpreted code is lower today than it ever has been."/>
			<outline text="It's not clear if the Macintosh application model can be directly supported on NextStep. Macintosh and Windows apps are event based, and NextStep apps are class hierarchies. Cross-platform apps will have an easier transition than apps that are coded for either Windows or Macintosh. "/>
			<outline text="What does the interapplication communication model on NextStep look like? Again in this case, higher level systems are going to have an advantage. It's easy to map a high-level interapplication model onto a lower one. I'm looking forward to learning more here."/>
			<outline text="***Apple and the Internet"/>
			<outline text="With the Next deal, Apple has acquired WebObjects, a powerful server-side development system for web applications. It will fit well into the already strong Macintosh market for dynamic web server applications. "/>
			<outline text="We look for new connections to enterprise databases thru WebObjects. Remember that websites are LANs, so the porting issues are much less of a concern. A Mac-based server running WebSTAR, NetPresenz or Quid Pro Quo, or Apple's new server, can easily connect to a WebObjects server running on a NextStep system."/>
			<outline text="This represents a new opportunity for activism in the Macintosh web developer community. An interesting demo for MacWorld Expo is totally do-able, even though there are only {number (date (&quot;Jan 7,1997&quot;) - clock.now ()) / (60 * 60 * 24)} days before the keynote session on January 7."/>
			<outline text="A committment from Netscape to produce a NextStep version of their browser, followed by quick release, would give NextStep the traction it needs to be a serious web content development platform. Without Netscape, it's going to be limited as a web client and therefore limited as a content platform, since developers have to preview content as they are developing."/>
			<outline text="Although Microsoft has made no announcement, I believe they will quickly produce a NextStep version of their Internet Explorer web browser. It's consistent with the way they parse the world. If they fail to produce one, they would be making a clear judgement on Apple's direction. I don't think it's worth it to Microsoft to challenge Apple on this level. To be clear, this part is pure speculation."/>
			<outline text="I understand that Next already has an excellent email client. Connecting it with other net-based apps will be a high priority. I wonder if Eudora and Claris's email products will be ported?"/>
			<outline text="***A time of great opportunity"/>
			<outline text="To win, Apple must continue to make it clear that the Mac platform has their full support. The stronger the connection the safer Apple will be. Some energy is sure to dissipate. Apple's mission must be to minimize the dissipation."/>
			<outline text="Learn from history. Apple was able to transition much of the Apple II installed base to the Macintosh. Apple also smoothly transitioned from 68K to PowerPC. But the System 7 transition took more than three years. Very few Mac users are using Newton. IBM and Microsoft weren't able to transition PC-DOS users to OS/2. Windows NT is very slowly making inroads into the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 markets."/>
			<outline text="It's a time of great risk at Apple and in MacLand. The power is with the users. It's always been there, but this transition wakes them up. It's time for clear thinking among Macintosh users. Make realistic demands on developers. They're going to be offering Macintosh software for quite some time to come. Many developers depend on people buying and using that software. If you depend on the software, please set your expectations realistically. "/>
			<outline text="It's a time of great risk, but it's also a time of great opportunity. Few people doubt that NextStep is a more powerful modern basis than the Macintosh OS. The trick is going to be in building energy behind that system, and staying balanced. Careful platform management at this point will make the difference."/>
			<outline text="***We're watching Apple closely now"/>
			<outline text="Apple's first public statements were cause for concern, but their response has been appropriate. On Saturday I said communication was needed, and on Monday communication happened. I'm going to expect the best possible outcome, that Apple will continue to show appreciation for user and developer investments, as they ask us to reinvest. "/>
			<outline text="Apple must set realistic goals for developers and make realistic promises to users. Understand mistakes of the past. When Apple says SuperStuff is the hot new thing, users repeat the mantra to developers, setting expectations, distracting investment. If SuperStuff fails to materialize as an economic system, energy is lost, money is lost, Mac developers are less competitive with developers on other platforms, some even go out of business."/>
			<outline text="***Depend on developers"/>
			<outline text="This is an old plea, from developer to platform vendor, but now we have the attention of a vendor. I believe they will listen in 1997 as they never have before. If NextStep becomes a great developer platform, Apple wins and developers win. They need us now, and I bet they know it. Apple of the past has had an uncomfortable relationship with developers. Now comfort is the only way they can continue."/>
			<outline text="The only prudent path for Apple is bilateral. Macintosh forever. NextStep in the future. They must trust and depend on developers. Wipe as many slates clean as possible. Keep Apple's to-do list manageable. Depend on developers. Depend on developers. Depend on developers. "/>
			<outline text="One more time... "/>
			<outline text="Depend on developers."/>
			<outline text="***Accept &amp; Respect"/>
			<outline text="I'm remembering the lessons of &quot;Accept &amp; Respect&quot;, 12/13/96, and giving Apple the opportunity to be a positive platform vendor. I ask Apple to recognize what Mac developers have already accomplished in server, content tools and client software. In return, we can provide them with the heat necessary to make the new platform happen. We need assurances, with teeth, that Apple will let competitive markets develop without interference. "/>
			<outline text="***Arrogance"/>
			<outline text="Now more than ever, it's necessary for the vestigial arrogance of the Mac to fall away. We can't work together with all that religious noise. Drinking the Kool Aid is not the answer. Being thoughtful, realistic and respectful is the only way forward."/>
			<outline text="See &quot;The Arrogance Of The Mac&quot;, 11/10/96."/>
			<outline text="***We're going somewhere new"/>
			<outline text="I've been very pleased with the attitude of Next people so far. They've been outgoing, humble, inquisitive and very respectful. It's not surprising, given the difficulties they've had. They don't expect it to be easy. They've not had an easy time so far. This gives them a calmness that's refreshing. "/>
			<outline text="Working with Next people is not at all like working with Steve Jobs' Apple of the 1980s. It's clearly not an infinite loop. We're going somewhere new."/>
			<outline text="***And so this is Christmas"/>
			<outline text="So much music is written about Christmas! Everyone has their favorite song. Mine is John Lennon's Christmas Song, sung with his wife Yoko  Ono, and his children. It goes like this..."/>
			<outline text="&quot;So this is Christmas, and what have you done? Another year over, and a new one just begun. And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun! The near and the dear ones, the old and the young. A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Let's hope it's good one, without any fear. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;And so this is Christmas (war is over) for weak and for strong (if you want it). The rich and the poor ones, the world is so young! And so Happy Christmas for black and for white, for yellow and red ones, let's stop all the fight! A very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, let's hope it's a good one without any fear.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="As a very young man, I looked up to John Lennon. A funny guy, he had an ironic sense of humor, and sense of himself. He taught me a lot. He stated the obvious and accepted the consequences. Many people didn't want to hear what he had to say. But as a young man, I did. And as a more mature man, I still do."/>
			<outline text="His song is more poignant because John Lennon is gone. But even after his death, we can accept his love, and rejoice in the music he gave us. He asked us to appreciate each other. And, if we can do that, war is over! You can't kill someone you truly appreciate."/>
			<outline text="If you have a few minutes over the holiday, I highly recommend reading the 1981 Playboy &lt;a href=&quot;http://pipi.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ishihara/rec/beatles/playboy/interview.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with John and Yoko. "/>

It invokes parental wires, reminds him that his words could be judged as reflecting on him, not the person they're aimed at. "/>
			<outline text="It also gives *me* what I want. I've said what I said, they're reading a lot more into it than is fair. The correct closure on such an exchange is to insist that, if the conversation is to continue, that disrespect not be permitted."/>

			<outline text="It's cool when the messages start coming from Apple. "/>
			<outline text="It shows that they're listening.  "/>
			<outline text="Thank you! "/>
			<outline text="(I really mean that. I don't believe in sarcasm. Please keep reading.)"/>
			<outline text="***There's an art to moving forward"/>
			<outline text="There's even been a consistency to the messages, this makes me think they've been talking about me at Apple. I like that. Back in the old days, before I had a place to speak publicly, they could summarize my views as simply being &quot;anti-Apple&quot; and leave it at that. "/>
			<outline text="Now as I weave, turn corners, learn, process new information, they must be getting the idea that at least one of their developers isn't quite as simple as they thought he was."/>
			<outline text="I think there's something to learn here. An awareness of how other people think may help some platform vendor somewhere at some time. Complex human systems aren't simple. Platforms beget platforms. Movement and uprooting of people are different things. There's an art to moving forward. "/>
			<outline text="***Who's talking?"/>
			<outline text="I am a platform vendor. When I move, I bring other developers with me. "/>
			<outline text="I write publicly, so I hear from other developers. I know when I've hit a nerve because the system provides me with a clear channel for feedback. "/>
			<outline text="I am also a member of MIDAS, the Macintosh Internet Developer Association. Being in this loop also helps me get a broader perspective."/>
			<outline text="These three flows -- my users, my readers, and my peers, give me a pretty valuble perspective on this slice of the world. If you think there's no substance behind my statements, think again. My pieces are original, somewhat, but I am also an assimilator. Sometimes my pieces are just an amalgram (look it up!) of dozens of emails and phone conversations. "/>
			<outline text="***Platform vendors"/>
			<outline text="As a platform vendor, I have many of the same issues I have with Apple with members of the Frontier scripting community. I am more sensitive to the issues on both sides of this equation than I used to be. I've even had some of my DaveNet pieces turned back on me! I pay attention to those, the lessons hurt, but I try to learn from them even so. The deepest lessons can be the most painful ones. "/>
			<outline text="Before we had a platform it was easier for me to move. Now that we're being watched more closely, we have to let people know where we're going."/>
			<outline text="There's a cost to nailing down decisions, letting people know where you're going. But there's a bigger cost in keeping them in the dark. Confusion makes people freeze. Development stops. Other options are explored more seriously. At every discontinuity you lose some energy. So you have to smoothe the transitions, make them less discontinuous, nail more down, sooner, and avoid throwing the cards in the air whenever possible."/>
			<outline text="I learn. Last year I started a thread called Clay Basket, and abandoned it. It was a feedback loop, when I started working on websites without Clay, an outpouring of rage filled its mailing list. I told people where I was at, but they didn't like it. They read the worst of the tea-leaves. I couldn't handle it, because I didn't know where we were going at the time. Sometimes I think about doing something with Clay, but I always look elsewhere because communication is so screwed up in that community. It was a time of great change for me. The rage made me want to look away. I'll try not to let that happen again, but there can't be any guarantees. "/>
			<outline text="So this summer, when we decided to invest in making Frontier cross-platform, we broadcast that intention the instant we made the decision. I didn't want people to misunderstand our actions. "/>
			<outline text="***Tea leaves"/>
			<outline text="People who care, developers who invest, are *always* reading tea-leaves. The larger their investment the more concern they have about every move the vendor makes. Either it's going to encroach on their territory, or obsolete their investment by abandoning it. There are lots of scenarios where developers lose. The problem is, if the developers lose, and if the platform depends on developers, the platform loses too. So you try to strike a balance, leave enough empty territory, and broadcast your direction loud and clear and unmistakeably."/>
			<outline text="It can be frustrating being the platform vendor when you've left big blue sky and people crowd into the territory you're actively developing in. I guess this is human nature. People watch the leader, and want to be where the action is. Also, the platform vendor tends to choose the most lucrative areas to work in. That's where people want to be."/>
			<outline text="***Better results"/>
			<outline text="We've had better results in the Frontier community, after some initial collisions, I'm satisfied that I can move forward in certain areas and depend on others to handle other functionality. Examples of successes include database scripting, CGIs, search engines, regular expression handling. "/>
			<outline text="A less stunning success has been TCP scripting which is still an unsolved problem in our community. After promises from Microsoft and Apple, neither company has delivered, and we depended on their software in this area. It's frustrating that Microsoft is investing more in end-user stuff instead of developer stuff, and equally so that Apple is doing Cyberdog when developers lack a toolkit of basic TCP functionality at the system level."/>
			<outline text="***The feeding chain"/>
			<outline text="See -- there's a feeding chain in place here. Many tiers. A subtle system. How clearly do *my* platform vendors, Microsoft, Apple, Netscape, see thru my level and appreciate that I represent the interests of many other powerful people? That it isn't my favor they should seek, but the favor of the people who use and build on my software? It's frustrating that we probably have more developers than Next or Be does, and they all use Macs, yet Apple still seems to view me as a single point, and doesn't appreciate that I'm backed up by a community."/>
			<outline text="Given the level at which they are listening to me at Apple now (all levels!) it's time for me to ask them to leave their comfortable but inaccurate view of the world, and learn about what has been built around their operating system and computer hardware. I feel like a parent, wanting grandma to see that they have a large family behind them that they haven't met yet."/>
			<outline text="Unfortunately, it's not a good time for Apple people to listen. All their cards are in the air too. I really understand that. As individuals, they're going to be busy figuring out lots of stuff, and the pressure will be enormous. I sympathize. But I have to stay centered on my own interests. We could move forward powerfully, but to do so, we are going to have to let go of a lot of old ideas that aren't serving us well."/>
			<outline text="So, Apple, it's your job to tell me what to tell people who build systems using my software and Macintoshes. And understand that every Apple developer has exactly the same problem. Listen carefully and you'll hear that clearly."/>
			<outline text="***Interesting"/>
			<outline text="This has been a very interesting piece to write because it sits squarely at the intersection of two communities, one of which I lead, and one of which I am a member of. I had to speak both as a developer and a platform vendor here. Please understand that this piece is for Apple, Microsoft, Netscape; and for Frontier people, as well as other developers who do mail clients, web servers, content tools, and must fit their products into the strategies of companies that are higher up on the feeding chain. "/>
			<outline text="In a sense, we all have to do that. Apple, Compaq, IBM and Dell must make their products run on electricity and communication wires. Netscape makes software for Unix, Mac and Windows. Microsoft is both a developer and a platform vendor, in different contexts. Straddling this fence is nothing new. Writing about it publicly *is* a new thing."/>
