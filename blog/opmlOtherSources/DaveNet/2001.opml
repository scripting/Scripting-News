			<outline text="Good morning">
				<outline text="And welcome to 2001!"/>
				<outline text="What a trip. There's no doubt we're in a new century now, and who knows what that means. I'll never see one of these again. Born in 1955 it splits my existence in two, one in the 20th century, and another in this century. This century. It's a different one. What does it mean? Probably nothing. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dot-com bust">
				<outline text="In the spring the stock market took a dive, no one could be sure if it was a blip or a trend. Now there is no doubt. It was the end of the Dot-com model. It's had a chance to sink in and then sink in again at a deeper level."/>
				<outline text="It's over. You can't build value by attracting lots of users and monetizing them later. This logic is not sellable now, and possibly never will be again. That's OK, but many are left holding a bag of servers and services designed in the Dot-com period. How do we turn the corner?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Decentralize">
				<outline text="It costs money to buy servers and keep them running. When you add features you have to add more servers, because it's inevitable that those features consume CPU cycles. But investors aren't buying us free servers any more, so we have to make the ones we have do more work by distributing the work."/>
				<outline text="In the centralized model for the Internet, your browser makes requests of a server that could be very far away, or slow for other reasons. Now imagine that the server is very close and you don't have to share it with anyone, it's yours and yours alone. It would be fast! "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is a Desktop Website?">
				<outline text="So how do we get the website so close to your browser?"/>
				<outline text="By putting it on your machine!"/>
				<outline text="That's what Desktop Websites are about. Like Desktop Publishing (DTP) of the 1980s, more of the Web of 2001 will reside on your hard drive, using the CPU cycles of your machine, not on a machine purchased by investors. DTP put new power in the hands of users, and Desktop Websites do that too."/>
				<outline text="Desktop Websites are much like the ones on centralized servers. But they coordinate with a minimum functionality &quot;cloud&quot; that links things together, in the background, using SOAP and XML-RPC. The packets it sends are smaller because they don't include rendering information. And the communication channel can be optimized to flow content when you're not using bandwidth. The result will be higher fidelity audio and video and no waiting."/>
				<outline text="You're creating and consuming content in XML, but to the user it looks like a beautiful graphic website, with checkboxes, buttons and a simple text editor, and it's faster than any website you've ever used, because there's no network latency."/>
				<outline text="I'm using such a website now and loving it. Users will love it because it's so fast and just as easy as using a website that's far away. And guys like me, who run free servers for thousands of people will love it too, because the same servers will be able to connect many more people. By moving most of the work to the edges, our servers only make introductions, they're not doing the heavy lifting they're asked to do in the Dot-com model."/>
				<outline text="I'll be writing lots more about this, in &quot;DaveNet&quot; and on &quot;Scripting News&quot;. UserLand is going to be in the middle with our Radio UserLand software, but I expect Desktop Websites to show up from all corners of the Web developer community. Rarely do things come together this neatly. "/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What if technologists had integrity?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/7/01; 7:20:09 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Integrity and doctors">
				<outline text="We all hopefully presume that our doctors have integrity. We hope that when they prescribe a medicine they're doing it because it will help us, not because it will help them. Imagine a world where doctors got kickbacks for choosing one medicine over another. I think we'd all be a lot sicker."/>
				<outline text="Same with cops, even lawyers have rules of ethics, and politicians, but.. not technologists. Perhaps because our profession is so new, there are few groundrules, so those of us who try to coax the truth out of ones and zeros have some ad hoc rules that seem to work most of the time. "/>
				<outline text="Most of the technologists I know have very high integrity, as much as most doctors, lawyers and cops. However because we have no rules, we're vulnerable to cheap shots and pretenders. That's the other side, the presumption of lack of integrity, and the tech press takes advantage of this."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Imagine">
				<outline text="Imagine if your doctor said &quot;Hmmm, well you have a bad disease, the prognosis is not good, but there's a new experimental drug that holds great promise for curing it.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Now the tech industry is that sick, and it needs a cure. The venture capitalists, who have lead us for the last dozen years, made mostly short-term investments. Even worse, they backed a socialization of software development, so that virtually all the money is out of it. With due respect to my sensitive friends in the open source development community, this is not about you, it's about the VC's belief that they can wish money into existence out of thin air. This premise worked fine while the stock market went along with the dream, and the users were happy, it's like a dream come true for them, everything's free! It had to end sometime. It did. Ooops."/>
				<outline text="Now let's rebuild."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Technologists and journalists">
				<outline text="Technologists like money, up to a point, like everyone else, but like doctors and cops (maybe not lawyers) we don't *do* it for the money. We do it for the joy of exploring something that we're good at, and for the joy of making users happy. At least this is what I mean when I use the word."/>
				<outline text="But the tech press, they travel in packs and herds, rewriting each others' stories. I've watched them climb on the back of technology so many times proclaiming that X Kills Y, quoting analysts who are on the payroll of X or Y, pretending that there's some integrity to this. It's gotten so bad that even experimental technologies that hold great promise are dis'd before they get a chance. (What if they reported on medicine this way?)"/>
				<outline text="I can hear Newsweek's &lt;a href=&quot;http://buzz.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Deborah Branscum&lt;/a&gt; cringing, she thinks of tech people the same way, but it's our marketing shills and carpetbaggers she's complaining about. Stop listening to them and they'll go away. (Please!)"/>
				<outline text="And probe the backgrounds of the people who present themselves as technologists. Define some reasonable, sober rules. I believe you'll find that many of the biggest names don't measure up."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="News.Com">
				<outline text="I've seen all kinds of speculative articles about SOAP, but Mary Jo Foley's article on News.Com last month was the pinnacle so far. "/>
				<outline text="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-4298495-0.html "/>
				<outline text="She says delivery is uncertain. Of course she's talking about delivery from big companies with conservative customers and misses the revolutionary applications of the technology that have already happened."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Let's work on our voices">
				<outline text="Is this any way to run an industry with underlying integrity? Can the users and investors be forgiven for thinking we're all charlatans if that's all they ever hear from?"/>
				<outline text="To technologists, being heard and understood has never been more important."/>
				<outline text="Distributed applications built on the standards of the Internet are coming online strong, for good reasons, despite what the reporters say. Their interest is to sell newspapers (or page-reads) or to develop their careers (most analysts start as reporters, quoting the analysts) not in finding and explaining new trends in technology, which is *our* job. In other words if you're waiting for the press to do your job, you'll wait forever."/>
				<outline text="All the admonitions (see above) will not coax integrity from the process. Instead, we have to, as technologists, re-form journalism, Cluetrain-style, so our voices can be heard without interpretation, without a corrupt analyst to say we're too small, to be crushed by the giants, or (the honest truth) we don't pay him enough (because we want integrity in their profession). Let your ideas find a marketplace among people with minds and non-trivial attention-spans."/>
				<outline text="Back in the 80s when the problem was much smaller, I always wished I could read, alongside an InfoWorld or PC Magazine software review, in the developer's own words -- what's the purpose of the product? Cut through the middlemen. What problem were you trying to solve? What's coming next? Go ahead and share your wildest dreams. "/>
				<outline text="So much gets lost in the translation, they're not even trying to get closer to what's really going on. As the women's movement taught us, and as Annie Lenox sang, it's time to do it for ourselves."/>

			<outline text="SOAP meets RSS">
				<outline text="As one of the designers of both &lt;a href=&quot;http://soap.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/rss091&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; it's been my fondest hope that these two pioneering technologies would get married and have kids someday."/>
				<outline text="Here's the invitation:"/>
				<outline text="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/soapMeetsRss"/>
				<outline text="Please pass it around far and wide."/>
				<outline text="Thanks.."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Doc's question">
				<outline text="In the last &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/01/07/whatIfTechnologistsHadIntegrity&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, and on Doc Searls' &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/01/07&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt;, integrity has become the hot topic that I thought it would. Even while the dotcom culture was raging, I felt there was some unfinished business -- we haven't defined in any concise way what integrity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=integrity&quot;&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; as we slosh between roles, writing one day, being a technologist another day, and writing again. "/>
				<outline text="In the last piece I ask technologists to write, because that's the most direct path to the truth, but what do they have to tell us about themselves before we trust them? "/>
				<outline text="I'll go first. SOAP and RSS are two important open technologies, one for distributed computing and the other for syndication. DaveNet is a less technical venue so I don't probe the depths of the marriage here, I created a separate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetwowayweb.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for that purpose. But all, SOAP, RSS and DaveNet, imho, have integrity because they are what they appear to be, and I strive to keep them focused on what they are. "/>
				<outline text="I say these things have integrity, and my friend Doc asks What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; integrity? I use the term as if everyone knows what it means, but what does it mean?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is integrity?">
				<outline text="First, let's step outside and look in. Start with an inanimate object. A boat for example. A boat that leaks lacks integrity. If the leaking gets bad enough it stops being a boat and becomes a sunken boat. If someone is living on the boat, it becomes a houseboat. If its nature changes, so does the name."/>
				<outline text="Like a boat, a human being has integrity if he or she is what he or she appears to be. That's why integrity commands us to disclose conflicts, so that what we say, and who we appear to be, are in synch. Change the appearance if necessary. "/>
				<outline text="In my humble opinion, everything starts with integrity, boats, rocks, houses, people. When I get a bad feeling and really probe it, go deep into it and ask it to explain itself, the concern almost always relates to integrity. If I lied about something, or did something dirty it &lt;i&gt;makes me feel bad. &lt;/i&gt;From that I conclude that my brain has an integrity mechanism that has something to do with survival, because the bad feeling is primal and feels related to survival. "/>
				<outline text="This is why our planet works, to the extent that it does. You don't have to lock every door all the time. There are times when it's OK to be vulnerable. The Web, believe it or not, is quite vulnerable. Yet it works."/>
				<outline text="This makes sense because evolution created humans as a social species, the judgment by and acceptance of our contemporaries is very important to our survival. When the integrity of communication is compromised, the survival question is triggered, it's as if Who I Am is bleeding, and if I don't stop it, I will turn into something other than a human. (In other words dead.)"/>
				<outline text="Hey it's easy to write about integrity in boats, but it's harder to write about it in humans. Perhaps another species could explain our nature more easily. Let's put it this way. Without integrity, I think we lose our humanity and become something else, something less."/>

			<outline text="A new way to browse">
				<outline text="I've been lucky to have some great teachers in the area of big media and computer networks, notably Marc Canter and Adam Curry. Marc is the founder of Macromedia, the company that created Director, Shockwave, Flash and Dreamweaver; and Adam is one of the founders of MTV, and went on to become an early Internet entrepreneur. Both have new companies in 2001 to develop technologies that are related to the stuff we're doing at UserLand. I know that Marc and Adam spent a lot of time talking last year, so the ideas that I explain here are a mix of Marc, Adam and me, Dave Winer."/>
				<outline text="Also, I'd like to pay special &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=homage&quot;&gt;homage&lt;/a&gt; to the Grateful Dead, who have generously allowed their creations to be used to bootstrap new technology in non-commercial ways. To get this process going, we need a content base to get started with. So many technologists, me included, love the music of the Dead. I think they may have left a legacy for technologists that's as important as the legacy they left in music. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The click-wait system">
				<outline text="When I started talking with Adam late last year, he wanted me to think about high quality video on the Internet, and I totally didn't want to hear about it. Like a lot of people, I had tried it, and found it unsatisfying and frankly, exhausting. "/>
				<outline text="I thought that video on the Internet was a loser for three reasons, that build on each other:"/>
				<outline text="1. When I click on a link to view some video, I have to wait."/>
				<outline text="2. The wait is longer than the video. (In other words I have to wait two minutes for ten seconds of video.)"/>
				<outline text="3. The quality is horrible."/>
				<outline text="All three effects are bad, but the first is the worst. The Internet lifestyle is frenetic. There's no time to wait. The remaining two negatives only make video less attractive, but the first is the killer."/>
				<outline text="But Adam persisted and showed me that if I was willing to change my point of view, it could work, without any waiting and with very high quality."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No click-wait">
				<outline text="What if, in the middle of the night, while I'm not using my computer, it downloads huge video and audio stuff to my local hard drive. Then when I arrive in the morning there are fresh bits, news clips, a song of the day, whatever, provided by all kinds of content providers, from big TV networks like CNN and MSNBC, to a Dutch school where kids are taking a film class using inexpensive video recorders and iMacs. "/>
				<outline text="Let's see what happens with 1, 2 and 3 in this scenario."/>
				<outline text="1. When I click on a link to view some video, it starts playing immediately, because it is already on my local disk."/>
				<outline text="2. The wait is zero."/>
				<outline text="3. The quality is limited by the size of my local disk, not by the capacity of my connection."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A different user interface">
				<outline text="What's different about this system is that you &lt;i&gt;subscribe&lt;/i&gt; to channels instead of clicking-and-waiting. I feel that nothing is lost with this approach, because video on the Internet never worked for me, and probably for many others. However, streaming news items through RSS works quite well, and it's a simple matter to teach RSS about multimedia payloads. "/>
				<outline text="Of course there's a change in user interface. You never see a video or music document until it's fully downloaded. The computer does the waiting, not you. In the system that Marc and Adam envision, a video DJ, someone like Adam at MTV in the 80s and 90s, someone whose judgment you trust, or whose tastes you like, is pushing high fidelity bits onto your hard drive, using no more hardware and network connections than you already have."/>
				<outline text="In the world that Adam and Marc envision, there is no central authority, no spectrum to allocate, it's open to amateurs, like the Internet itself. We are not hoping to recreate the flat everyone-is-the-same world that television dictates, quite the opposite. With inexpensive video and audio recorders, and personal computer-based editing systems, all you need is time, ideas and passion to create; and with a format for subscriptions, everyone who wants to, can be a content provider."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A new element">
				<outline text="So that's the philosophy, now let's put some meat on the bones."/>
				<outline text="&quot;RSS&quot; already does most of what we want. With the addition of the &amp;lt;enclosure&amp;gt; sub-element of &amp;lt;item&amp;gt; any RSS element can describe a video or audio file (actually any type of file). "/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;enclosure&amp;gt; has three attributes: url says where the file is located, length says how big it is, and type says what its type is. This way a workstation or aggregator can know in advance, without having to do any communication, what it's going to get, and apply scheduling and filtering rules."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="An example">
				<outline text="Here's an example of a RSS file that delivers a different Grateful Dead song to subscribers every day. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/gratefulDead.xml"/>
				<outline text="Each &amp;lt;item&amp;gt; contains an &amp;lt;enclosure&amp;gt; as explained above."/>
				<outline text="&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;enclosure url=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/touchOfGrey.mp3&quot; length=&quot;5588242&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I've configured my system to download enclosures between 1AM and 4AM, a time when I don't use my computer."/>
				<outline text="When I arrive at work, I check the incoming Log and see there's a new song."/>
				<outline text="I click. It plays. "/>
				<outline text="No wait."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Software">
				<outline text="My company, UserLand, has a product in development called &quot;My.UserLand On The Desktop&quot; that supports both sides of this format. You can use it to create channels that have &amp;lt;item&amp;gt;s with &amp;lt;enclosure&amp;gt;s, and it manages downloads for these channels. So it's both an authoring and viewing tool."/>
				<outline text="It's a bootstrap, and it's open, meaning that anyone can develop software that works on either or both sides of this connection. "/>
				<outline text="Adam's company is doing a graphic environment for music and video on PCs in Java. Others are welcome to join up and do software for all kinds of computers, content and people."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A touch of grey">
				<outline text="I anticipate complaints along these lines -- &quot;This is just email.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="But it's not. First, everything on the Internet is just like something else. Or if it's any good it's just like &lt;i&gt;everything else.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If you try to push video and audio through email you'll find the client user interface as daunting as the wait-click Web experience. How do I keep enclosures from downloading while I'm accessing email from a phone connection in a hotel? Sure, you could add a complex dialog to an already overly-complex email client user interface, and the result would be that no one could set it up properly and no new video would actually get to the desktop. (You'd hate the feature until you figured out how to turn it off.)"/>
				<outline text="Further, when you view video in a client that wasn't designed for it, it can look techy and sterile. I believe that's why Adam and his team are doing such a gorgeous graphic environment for video."/>
				<outline text="Another important point, there's no reason that RSS can't be delivered via email, in fact we plan to do that. But first we need a format that can carry the payload we want it to carry. In the end it may all run over email, but first we have to step outside its limits and create a variety of different environments and see what people like and what works."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;John Doerr on a bicycle&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/1/01; 8:32:04 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="John Doerr">
				<outline text="Last Saturday I was on my daily walk, listening to NPR of course, approaching a hill and two bike-riders pass me, huffing and puffing, wearing the usual bright-colored tight-fitting clothes that bike riders like to wear. Then something very unusual happened. A man riding a bicycle wearing business clothes passes me. &quot;Why is that man riding a bicycle wearing business clothes?&quot; I wondered. Then, on reaching the top of the hill, I see that it's John Doerr! I didn't dream this, it actually happened."/>
				<outline text="In case you don't know, Doerr is a partner at Kleiner-Perkins, one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capital firms. He's a very powerful man, but you might not know it to talk with him. I've always had a warm spot in my heart for John, I think that's part of his magic. His attention is focused, very sharply, and it can be years between our conversations, but when I see him it's almost as if we're talking every day. We talked for about fifteen minutes there on the street, as they say in diplomacy, it was a frank talk, but very friendly."/>
				<outline text="I thought about this conversation, which I will try to recount here, on returning from a confidential briefing at Microsoft about their activities in distributed computing on the Internet, technology we worked with them on for the last two and a half years. "/>
				<outline text="As I watch the next steps unfold, I realize that we lost to Microsoft, John and I, and now they're trying, the best they can, to be good winners, probably with the help of the US government who won a lawsuit proving that Microsoft had behaved poorly in its competition with Netscape, a company that Doerr founded along with Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen."/>
				<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;weLostToMicrosoft&quot;&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; lost, yet most of us didn't have any say in what Netscape did. We lost our two-party-system, and now the browser, probably the most pivotal piece of software in existence, is owned by Microsoft. This is an uncomfortable situation, to say the least. Now Microsoft, driven by its own logic, is reluctant to move the browser where its destiny calls. There's an important linkup that's not happening, the Web wants to be a writing environment, and as long as the same company owns both the browser and the leading word processor, and as long as the investment community of the Valley doesn't tune in, it's not going to happen."/>
				<outline text="Like Microsoft, I think the venture capital industry is responsible not only to their investors, but also to the larger developer community, the ones who create new stuff, rain or shine, whether or not they're riding a rocketship to IPO-land. We all have an interest in choice, because it keeps things competitive. If we had the support of Doerr, as we have asked for and received support from Gates, he could do a lot of good here, with more leverage than he can in the larger issues he and his wife Ann tackle, such as high quality education for all people, not just people with money. Leverage is the key here, and straightening things out also happens to be good for business, imho."/>
				<outline text="I urged Doerr to learn from what happened in the last few years. Long-term investments matter. Keeping the browser going, even though Netscape had lost its will to win (if it ever had it), was important to all of us. On Tuesday in Building 33 on the Microsoft campus, I argued that integrating writing and reading was in Microsoft's interest because it would create explosive growth in software, and that can only benefit the largest software company in the world. I think perhaps for the first time in its existence, Microsoft is ready to hear this message. Control is no longer an option for them. Now they have to contemplate, at least until our new President decides, what life would be like after being split in two. Can we manage this, as an industry, so it's a win-win? I think we can and I think Doerr is the man who can help the most."/>
				<outline text="I asked him to recall a phone conversation we had in the spring of 1998. I had been given permission by my partner in the SOAP process, Microsoft, to recruit participation from Silicon Valley technology companies. I thought of Netscape, Sun and Novell. I asked John to help make intros, which he did. But the net result was zip. My take on it? The companies were so focused on *not* working with Microsoft that the possibility of actually working with Microsoft couldn't penetrate. "/>
				<outline text="There must be some poison pill, goes the conventional thinking in Silicon Valley. There might have been one, but now with the benefit of two-plus years hindsight, it's clear that it couldn't work. Opening up the underside of your servers is a big win if your software is good, and something you might resist if it's not. Negating lock-in, which is SOAP's theme, opens the market. You can't require that software port to Java just to link to Java code bits. I have enough experience and a brain, I could see where it was going, and I wanted Sun and Netscape to give it up, but I don't think they cared what I thought, and I know they didn't trust Microsoft. Later, Sun embraced SOAP, but the embrace would have been more powerful if it had been done earlier. I was the messenger in 1998, but the message didn't get through. Now that's totally water under the bridge, but what clues does it have for our future?"/>
				<outline text="I wondered then and I wonder now, how can we work together, rain or shine, boom or bust, to keep technology moving, much as Alan Greenspan keeps our currency solid. Anyone who's been involved in technology for a few loops, as both John and I have, knows it's going to come back. In fact, we know while it's booming that the bust is coming and so is the next boom. So in addition to funding rocketships, it's good for all of us if we invest both short-term and long-term. Do the things that give technology somewhere to go. Let the professional managers worry about the next quarter, but also put bets down on technologies that may or may not pan out. Follow the grain of Moore's law and the equivalent law that says that users learn, and software can be easier, meaning that next time around we'll be doing the same thing, but it'll cost less, and more people will do it."/>
				<outline text="Today I'm more sure than ever that distributing the work is the way to go. Centralized servers no longer have a &quot;viable business model.&quot; That's good, because while our centralized servers huff and puff, the performance monitor on the PCs we use to browse and write for the Web stay flat, and so do the brains of most people using the Web. The users are getting bored, that's why our growth is flat too."/>
				<outline text="In the eighties we made productivity software and dreamed of groupware. Ask Esther. She called most of it. Now technology has caught up. Networking is deployed on a massive scale, as are the MIPs. All that's missing is new software to wire it all together. Now here's the surprise, and it wouldn't be a surprise if we were communicating within our Valley, the software already exists. "/>
				<outline text="Let's rebuild around this new model John, the Internet is a two-way medium, more like the telephone than the printing press or TV. There's a big picture and hope for the future, and the power of Microsoft is better organized and (I think) they are ready to cooperate. Let's work together."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What is .NET?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/4/01; 11:13:51 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning sports fans!">
				<outline text="I don't know why I'm saying that these days, but technology is seeming more like a sport, I guess that's nothing new if you read the industry pubs. Everything's a battle to the death, a call to arms, only one victor will emerge. Who gets hurt by this? seems the question I always get asked. I always answer no one. Get real. This is about selling computers and advertising, not about anything really new. No one gets hurt by nothing."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, tomorrow, apparently Sun will announce their threatening answer to Microsoft's .NET. I found out about this in an email from a Microsoft public relations person who works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wagged.com/&quot;&gt;Waggener-Edstrom&lt;/a&gt;. The email was an angry powerless needling whiny flamer, of the sort I'd expect to read on SlashDot, not coming from the mouthpiece of the largest software company in the world. "/>
				<outline text="What's the big deal. Sun endorsed SOAP. Either their Dot-Net-Equivalent is compatible with SOAP or it's meaningless. Therefore I conclude it will include SOAP support. Seems like a time to anticipate celebration, not to fan the flames."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is .NET?">
				<outline text="In the meantime, I'm still learning what .NET is. I've never seen it all brought together in one place, without hyperbole, or vague dumbed-down marketing-speak designed for reporters, or the other extreme, agonizing detail designed for Microsoft developers. What about the inbetween description, for people with minds who are willing to read a sentence two or three times, and think about, even ponder, what's being said?"/>
				<outline text="So of course I started a website to gather opinions on what .NET is. I know a bit about it so I can kick off the discussion right here."/>
				<outline text="I think .NET is a development and runtime environment that unifies the programming model for most of Microsoft's language products and can host other languages. All of Microsoft's disparate environments merge into one. This is like a camera manufacturer changing the size and shape of its lens mount. A lot of retooling will be going on in the next few years. And that's a very unusual thing for Microsoft, whose operating system still runs programs written in the early 80s (I know, I've tried, it works). The masters of continuity take a discontinuous step."/>
				<outline text="The .NET editor and debugger will be better because by concentrating all their energy on one system they can make a better one. Further, instead of having to propogate features across a lot of different code bases, they can do it once, and theoretically do it faster. These are all important things, but they are probably most important if you work at Microsoft or are a developer in their community."/>
				<outline text="Now, presumably Microsoft itself will adopt the .NET approach, and we'll see versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc, with a more uniform feature set and user interface. Perhaps the browser will become more deeply integrated with the system -- I hope not because I don't want to be sucked into using Word, PowerPoint and Excel, but there's a chance that they want me to. (A pretty good one I imagine, but I will cheerfully resist. I don't want any talking paperclips on my desktop thank you.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The big feature">
				<outline text="Now all that is nice and perhaps a bit boring, but the big feature of .NET is that it offers application integration with the standards of the Internet in the same way previous Microsoft environments (ie Windows) offered local area integration on the same machine (COM) or across Microsoft networks (DCOM)."/>
				<outline text="You know what I'm talking about -- it's SOAP. And today I can explain it in a whole new way. It's a like a bathtub with its plug pulled and connected to a shower head on the floor below, owned by your competitor. To keep the tub full you have to keep adding water, otherwise it will empty out. And even worse, when you add water to your bathtub, you know in advance that it's going to flow into your competitors! Hah. "/>
				<outline text="We have a choice, where do you want to go today? Maybe I want to go where the water is warmer, or the tub deeper, or whatever. SOAP opens the underside of application environments, it pulls the lock-in plug. Think of it as the advancement of the Internet into the architecture of applications, beyond the browser, now it makes no difference if your app is written Java or Perl or runs on Unix or Mac. This was the promise of Java in a way, but the force has been removed. You can use whatever OS you like and not be captured by Sun. This is good if you, like I, have a big investment in other langauges and/or environments, of if you're independent and don't want to be captured (been there done that)."/>
				<outline text="Microsoft keeps fighting the Java war, probably mostly for the benefit of the press. The war over Java was over the day IBM made SOAP run in Java. That created a fundamental change, Sun's lock-in was over. Java was unplugged. I could integrate Java bits into my applications without porting the whole mess to Java. This of course is what Sun wanted me to do, so instead of talking paper clips I could feel imprisoned by a dancing penguin. "/>
				<outline text="That it was so easy to add SOAP to Java, should be a clue to any future lock-in wannabe. It's not generally very hard to explode the lock-in bubble, and you can be sure from this point on, that it's going to happen. Better to disclaim any desire for lock-in. And it would be better if the press looked for this too, save us all a bunch of time waiting for the loop to iterate one more time."/>
				<outline text="So to Microsoft and Sun, and the reporters who cover them (feel free to quote me), the war was over a long time ago. When HTTP and HTML and then XML swept through our industry, they took out the opportunity for lock-in. The story is obsolete. That the current manifestation of this undermining, SOAP, would be covered as just another battle between the titans is a big joke. They're both undermined. I'd used to think that Microsoft gets this, but I wonder about that now. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Justice">
				<outline text="It's been suggested elsewhere that .NET is an answer to Joel Klein, who now works for Napster partner Bertelsmann, btw. "/>
				<outline text="By moving the line between the operating system and applications, Microsoft hopes to confuse the judicial process so thoroughly that they force the split in the wrong place. I don't know about this theory, but I am confused about .NET, so why wouldn't a judge be confused too?"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/6/01; 8:31:17 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning sports fans!">
				<outline text="First, a hat-tip to John Markoff at the New York Times, who wrote about Sun and Microsoft's latest face-off over open distributed computing protocols, XML-RPC and SOAP. "/>
				<outline text="He said: &quot;While each company preaches commitment to so-called open computing standards, all the approaches have essentially proved to be calculated efforts to guide customers toward proprietary software development platforms that would give the company a competitive advantage.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Yup, I think that's true. Thanks John."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Three years ago">
				<outline text="Our work in this area began almost three years ago, with a DaveNet piece about Java, Push and XML. This was followed by a phone call from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft, a few meetings and a couple of months later the XML-RPC spec. More work. SOAP 1.0. IBM comes on board, SOAP 1.1, and then a rocket-ship of growth for both protocols."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday Sun said they invented this stuff in the 1980s. Perhaps that's true, but they must have lost their way some time after Java came out. RMI, their cross-network protocol, is a totally closed box, it could only be used if your app ran in Java. Many of us said no. Yesterday was a clear capitulation, an acknowledged end to lock-in for Java."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Hail the little guys">
				<outline text="Here's the real story. The independent developers of Mac, Unix and Windows software got there first, before Microsoft, before Sun, and all the other would-be kingmakers. XML-RPC is a thing of beauty, created by developers, for developers, and it doesn't lock anyone in to any programming environment or operating system or economic system. Microsoft and Sun are free to use it, as are developers of the open source world. Commercial developers, application service providers, P2P, infrastructure and consulting companies, portals, vortals and hobbyists are welcome too, everyone is. Unlike most other communities, we have no rules or technical limits that keep anyone from participating."/>
				<outline text="Sun is not our friend, nor, really, is Microsoft (although Microsoft is trying). There's a new style of competition that may not favor their economics. So they have no choice but to try to capture it. But with SOAP and XML-RPC in place, their role becomes more prosaic. They have to supply tools that people like, and keep them moving, because without lock-in, we have choice, and therefore power to stay independent. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Quoting">
				<outline text="I don't usually quote large sections of previous essays, but today it seems appropriate to echo what I said on 2/27/98."/>
				<outline text="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml"/>
				<outline text="&quot;The Internet is a platform. A platform is made up of tools and runtimes. Internet tools run on all kinds of operating systems, as do the runtimes. The beauty of the net is its simplicity, its ubiquity and its lack of a controlling vendor. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;TCP is the runtime environment of the Internet. It's deeply competitive with Microsoft, and it's larger than Microsoft. The stronger TCP is, the more outside of Microsoft's control it is, the more powerful everyone else will be."/>
				<outline text="&quot;The Unix people have been in a struggle with everyone else over who owns the Internet. I've been writing about this for a long time. It would be great if they could let go of the struggle and realize that the Internet is owned by the universe, no single operating system or flavor of operating system can contain it."/>
				<outline text="&quot;This is important because there is another layer coming on the Internet, a very simple one, that can build on COM, on Windows and elsewhere, and provide a flat playing field for everyone."/>
				<outline text="&quot;It's RPC over HTTP via XML. I believe it's the next protocol for runtimes. We'll be posting more notes on this on Scripting News over the next few weeks. Please, if you care about the independence of the Internet, tune in. Thanks!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="That was almost three years ago!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The real work begins now">
				<outline text="Now that open distributed computing protocols have become a battlefield between the giants, there's an urgency to get our act together so this time it really happens, we really get the independence that we want, and the bullies step aside and stop trying to define and limit what we can do. It's clear that Sun and Microsoft care largely about themselves and each other, and if we want to continue to make software with some chance of success, we have to keep the path clear of their interference."/>
				<outline text="This message is to my colleagues who work in and on XML-RPC and SOAP. We have a very good thing going, but it's just a start. The thing to fear most is dilution of what XML-RPC means. A Sun version and Microsoft version is not good, nor is an Apache or Perl version. They must all interoperate."/>
				<outline text="I could have chosen to not embrace SOAP, and perhaps I should have. Previous experience with Apple over similar protocols taught me that &quot;innovation&quot; by large gorillas is inevitable. I also felt that without support from Microsoft or another similar well-known titan, this technology would languish in the margins of the software world. No matter, I did embrace SOAP and encourage all developers to support it, but, it's not finished yet. Unlike XML-RPC, SOAP offers so much choice to developers that you can implement a spec-conforming app, yet *not* interoperate with other implementations. What SOAP needs now is a &quot;common subset&quot; that interoperates. It's time to get scientific and political and make deals, and get interop asap."/>
				<outline text="I am committed to getting our Frontier software working with the Java, Perl and Microsoft implementations. To that end, we've put up a Web App that validates SOAP 1.1 servers. "/>
				<outline text="http://validator.soapware.org/"/>
				<outline text="This is our first contribution to make sure the promise of XML-RPC doesn't evaporate as the big companies deploy their apps and do it with the usual hype and sleight-of-hand. Let's narrow the focus of SOAP in the real world, and then let's tell the press clearly what it means to be compatible. "/>

			<outline text="Version 1.0">
				<outline text="A little over a year ago, before the dotcom bust, I wrote a piece entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet&quot;&gt;How To Make Money On The Internet&lt;/a&gt;. It was a rambler, written for the publishers I met at the World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos, Switzerland. "/>
				<outline text="It made sense for the times, but things have changed. To make money on the Internet, get a lot of people writing for your site, nurture them, teach them, find the best, and grow grow grow. Editorial people become talent scouts. Instead of employing writers, employ facilitators and teachers. Rewrite the rules of journalism to reach into the depths of our culture, in ways that print-based media can't. There's no limit to the coverage of the Web. Where the front page of a newspaper is finite, on the Web we have vertical scrollbars that can go (virtually) to infinity. If another good story comes along, point to it. It's pretty simple."/>
				<outline text="Perhaps it's not surprising that version 2.0 is a superset of 1.0, it's just an upgrade. The same advice applies, but now that the dust has cleared from the dotcom exuberance, the next steps are even more clear."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Print in retreat?">
				<outline text="In the course of doing my job I come in contact with a fair number of print journalists and their publishers. Now that the dotcommers are in retreat, you'd think the ones with solid print-based business models would be rushing to fill the new vacuum, but they're not. Most of them are not sure why they're on the Web, and many are pulling back. That's OK with me, because I have the business model figured out, and if they pull back, then there's nothing in my way. (They could be serious competition, but that's OK too.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Writing for the Internet">
				<outline text="In 1994 I started writing for the Internet. I wrote for free. Some people thought that at some point I'd charge for my writing, but I told them I wouldn't. Almost seven years later I'm still not charging. Why? Because I want people to read what I write, even people without a lot of money. I want to influence their thinking, I know I can't implement all my ideas, but I still want to see them happen. So I write publicly without any barriers. Anyone with a Web browser or email client can read what I write."/>
				<outline text="It worked. I learn so much this way. People explain things to me I'd never understand without patient and repeated drill. And I feed back what I learn. The result is my professional career has blossomed. I have the influence I sought, with nothing more than my mind, a keyboard and a few servers. While the dotcoms burned through billions, we arrived a *bigger* place spending much less money. Think about that, and the power of money, and how much more leverage you get with the Web. It really worked. Sometimes it's good to just reflect on that."/>
				<outline text="We're now hosting approximately 20,000 sites like mine. No one is paid to write. They do it for their own reasons, mostly (I think) for the same reasons I do, to study, learn and teach. And many of them have something interesting to say, some subject that they know a lot about. The quality keeps going up as new people join, and as people learn how this medium works and get new skills. Lately we've had a group of professional writers come on board, it's so welcome."/>
				<outline text="Then groups and associations form. People discover and read others with similar interests, point to them, comment on their ideas, refine and develop their own thinking. Round and round, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it never stops. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="How to make money">
				<outline text="So all this writing and thinking and idea-sharing is fun and gratifying but can you make a living doing it? I think so. "/>
				<outline text="Imagine a group of people who run Web servers writing for an ad hoc publication about Web servers. Since they're users, they tell their truth, they don't worry so much about offending. &quot;This sucks, don't do that, if only someone would make *this* product, we'd buy it in droves.&quot; You hear a lot of that."/>
				<outline text="Last year I saw this happen among Linux server operators. Then I tried an experiment, I invited people from Cobalt and VA Linux, companies that make Linux servers, to watch. Well, it didn't happen, but if they had come, they would have learned about products that users want. From there, it isn't too hard to see how money is made. Make the product people want and sell it to them."/>
				<outline text="But many companies seem scared of users. Our culture says that people buy products that geniuses develop. Contact with the user is something to say you do, but there's not a whole lot of that going on."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The new journalism">
				<outline text="So if the vendors won't come, what's to stop the users from becoming vendors? Further, if journalists won't write from a users' perspective, what's to stop the users from becoming journalists? With the Web, in computer and software products, not a whole lot. Could the users make the products they want for themselves? Yes they can. And can they make a profit doing it? Of course."/>
				<outline text="Remember Dell Computer started in Michael's dorm room. There's no reason new companies can't start on the Web. All it takes is the will to do it. And after computers every product that has an embedded computer will shift to user design. Today's companies become fulfillment houses, building products on contract. Manufacturing margins will shrink, the real value will be in the insight -- this is what people want now -- and the risk taken that today few manufacturers seem willing to take. "/>
				<outline text="But listening to users is actually not that easy. It's easier to *be* a user and make products for other users. And that my friends, the combination of user-based information exchange and products that reflect user experience and wants, is where money will be made on the Internet."/>

				<outline text="I did a 1/2 hour talk on The Two-Way-Web, just after my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=rohit+khare&quot;&gt;Rohit Khare&lt;/a&gt; who did his own Two-Way-Web presentation. The cool thing about the Two-Way-Web is that it goes two ways. Always."/>
				<outline text="We plan to build on Rohit's Two-Way-Web in our Two-Way-Web. All this was envisioned by our common teacher, Tim Berners-Lee, who was willing to design a system built on links that can break. This is the key philosophy to decentralization, a lovely term brought to us by Lucas Gonze. Don't wait for the chaos to end, embrace it, move on and do it again. The world will take care of itself. "/>
				<outline text="Hey is the abbreviation for The Two-Way-Web, 2WW or T2W2 or what?"/>
				<outline text="On Tuesday (Twosday?) I talked with my friend Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET, who is also working on a Two-Way-Web company. Halsey and I agree that it's like 1994 again. The space is so open, the next steps so obvious. Halsey's company, who must remain nameless for now, promises to fill in one of the quadrants in the map for the 2WW, and for that he has my gratitude and support."/>

				<outline text="Oh I'm rambling.."/>
				<outline text="I talked with David Galbraith with Moreover who has a stunningly simple idea for getting metadata into our content. I'll have to take some time to write it up so people can tune in. As often is the case it's all about user interface."/>
				<outline text="To the people in the XML-RPC community -- be proud, very proud -- our work is really catching on. I had a dozen great conversations yesterday with developers embracing XML-RPC wholesale, building their P2P apps on it. "/>
				<outline text="I talked with people from the Jabber community about merging. We agreed it's a no-brainer. I met an XML guy from Netscape. Talked with Johnny Deep from Aimster. Everyone seems to agree -- it's time for interop."/>
				<outline text="I also saw Chris Gulker yesterday. I introduced him to my friend Alex Cohen, now at Open Design, as the man who taught me everything I know about publishing. Before he did his Frontier-based system at the SF Examiner in the early 90s, I didn't understand how Frontier could play a role in publishing. The result is my weblog, thousands of Manila sites, and to some extent all the blogs you see on the Web today. Chris and I then got into a friendly competition during the 1994 San Francisco newspaper strike. He did the management website and I helped with the strike pub. Now in 2001, we're reaping the creative benefits of last year's Seattle newspaper strike through &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulandrews.manilasites.com/&quot;&gt;Paul Andrews&lt;/a&gt;. Moral of the story, change is coming in the news industry, and every time there's a strike, good things happen. And we're just figuring out how the dotcom bust is being felt in journalism. I want to make sure it's for the best."/>
				<outline text="Weblogs are the way to get ideas out there, and writers, if anything, are about getting their ideas out. More reporters are thinking about it. Paul Andrews, Glenn Fleishman, Doc Searls, Deborah Branscum and Dan Gillmor are actually doing it. My new friends the blog-empowered journalists are welcome to write guest DaveNets, as Clay Shirky, Esther Dyson and Bill Gates have. Use the Internet for what it's good at -- distributing ideas from people with minds to other mindful people. This is another kind of interop at an intellectual level. Mind-to-mind is another kind of P2P."/>

				<outline text="There's so much more to say, and I wish I had the time, but there's another day of conference ahead."/>
				<outline text="Before splitting, two more things."/>
				<outline text="First, we thrive when there's choice. The collapse of Netscape made the browser a one-party system, and that doesn't work, not even for Microsoft. That was the end of the browser as the space for innovation. But there's no shortage of people with ideas, so the bulge is happening around the browser and outside of it. "/>
				<outline text="Now in the P2P or Two-Way-Web space, whatever you call it, there are N parties. Sure there will be coalescing, but never, never let it get all the way to one party. Once that happens, the fun is over. Standardization is good, but competition is better. People ask why I was involved in both SOAP and XML-RPC. Here's why. Choice is necessary. If the gorillas stop listening to the indepedent developers, as they have in the recent past, we have our way out. XML-RPC and SOAP are owned by the Internet now. Every instance of interop helps insure our independence, and immunity from hostile takeovers from the giant technology companies. And every journalist who joins provides even more insurance. It's their turn, and ours. Two or more parties ensures freedom, and that, my friends, is what the Internet is about. "/>
				<outline text="The platform with no platform vendor. Yaha."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dinner tonight">
				<outline text="Finally, if you're going to be in San Francisco tonight, please come to the Scripting News dinner. It's a two-way venture with another great weblog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Hack The Planet&lt;/a&gt;. Wes Felter, its editor, is young and brilliant, where I am old and experieced. He attracts a different kind of crowd. My friends tend to be in power, his friends have power too, they write stuff like Freenet and Gnutella, but they're younger. "/>

			<outline text="Good morning sports fans!">
				<outline text="A week of schmoozing is good for idea flow. Coming back from the P2P conference, I can see that things have changed. The bright eyes are back. "/>
				<outline text="2001 will be the most pivotal year in our industry since 1994. What we do now will set the direction of the technology industry for the next ten or twenty years, as the 1994 corner-turn did. "/>
				<outline text="In 1994 we moved to centralize. Now we're moving to decentralized systems, for good economic reasons. The money to pay for centralized services has evaporated. In the next iteration of the Internet we'll create thinner servers and thicker clients.  "/>
				<outline text="This realignment will change the balance in the software business. Sun, whose tremendous growth in the 90s was derived at least partially from the push to centralized networking, will have to form links with software on the desktop. It was a good move for them to acquire StarOffice and Cobalt, and they probably should make some kind of deal with Apple, the major non-Microsoft desktop system vendor."/>
				<outline text="Like it or not, the tide is turning to favor Microsoft now. They had to struggle to make sense in the thick-server model of the 90s. Their products are already designed to work well in a decentralized model. Perhaps it's time for Microsoft to change its profile, to turn from the scrappy competitor to a leader-with-stature. There are signs pointing in both directions. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Cycles repeat">
				<outline text="Round and round the loop. "/>
				<outline text="First there's a technological breakthrough, in 1994 the networking stack reached the user interface. Before the Web it required a good imagination to see the benefits of networking. In the Web it was in your face, with Dancing Hamsters and Elian and Bill Clinton, Slashdot and News.Com, weblogs and Salon, eBay, AOL and Yahoo. As a result we now have a fantastic networking infrastructure that we didn't have before 1994. "/>
				<outline text="As the personal computer moved the cursor out of the mainframe &quot;glass palaces,&quot; the next version of the Internet will move the software and data that's now on centralized servers to the users' desktops, and it will evolve from there. "/>
				<outline text="In talks last week at the P2P conference I found it useful to call this Internet 3.0, to focus on the software that until now has remained invisible to all but a few. It's there, and you're going to be running some of it, soon. (And it won't just come from Microsoft.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Internet 3.0">
				<outline text="Version 1 was the pre-Web Internet, the playground of techies and geeks and professors and programmers. Gopher, FTP, email, newsgroups."/>
				<outline text="Version 2 was the Web, instant messaging and email. Broad adoption. You can buy movie tickets on the Web. Internet kiosks and cafes are everywhere. URLs on all business cards. Who needs the Yellow Pages when we have Yahoo?"/>
				<outline text="Internet 3.0 will realize the groupware vision of the late 80s which was really Doug Engelbart's vision of the 60s and 70s. Shared writing spaces with good boundaries. Structures that link to each other but are capable of managing greater complexity than the page-oriented metaphor of the Web. (Which few people read, everyone skims, so why not create interfaces that optimize for skimming.)"/>
				<outline text="How will money flow in version 3.0? First we need easy-to-program financial services available through SOAP and XML-RPC. A bank implemented in software. New companies will form, ones that leverage the communication tools to an advantage, to create products that are uniquely tuned to customers. Internet 2.0 brought us online car purchases, eBay, bill-paying, banking. Those were profound changes. Version 3.0 will refine this by giving us better tools for working with the new power."/>
				<outline text="Internet 3.0 will be a bootstrap. No steps will be skipped. This is why static low-tech formats based on XML are central to the next level of services, alongside the dynamic SOAP and XML-RPC-based services. It will scale from day one. "/>
				<outline text="Internet 3.0 will not be dominated by Sun, Microsoft or a startup coming from left field. Contrary to what some believe, there will be lots of Dot-Nets. My small company, UserLand, will compete with Microsoft for the runtime of Internet 3.0, and for authoring tools. We will beat them, and they will beat us, in other words they'll have customers and so will we. If we can conceive doing this, so can you. "/>
				<outline text="The bottom is open in version 3.0, as it was in 1.0 and 2.0, you can build off my success and have it flow through your software, and vice versa. The barriers are low, by design. You won't have to learn anything strange to latch onto the bus and get the flow to go through your bits. Same with Microsoft's software. You have my word on that. I'm watching carefully as we continue to work with them. If I see any attempt to lock in developers I will let you know. Same with Sun, IBM or anyone else."/>
				<outline text="The premise of all versions of the Internet is openness and choice. Even if it sometimes didn't appear that way while we were developing version 2.0, it was always true. We weren't locked in. Perhaps we can avoid this argument altogether in 3.0. (The only real threat is patents.)"/>
				<outline text="As with Version 2.0 it won't matter if you use Unix, Macintosh or Windows. You'll just be able to do more on all those operating systems. "/>
				<outline text="In Version 2.0 your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/relativelyFlatPerfMonitor.gif&quot;&gt;performance monitor&lt;/a&gt; got flatter and flatter as CPU performance traveled up Moore's curve, but the architecture failed to take advantage of it. In Version 3.0 your CPU will do more work and your local hard disk will contain (at least) backup copies of the information stored on centralized servers. There will be more opportunities to write scripts that customize your desktop, and include your own creations in the user interface. You won't have to be an eyeball (sometimes it's relaxing), your brain will be more active in Internet 3.0."/>

			<outline text="Thinking out loud">
				<outline text="I got a lot of email on my last very brief piece, it was written quickly and left a lot of room for imagination, new information, and pushback. That's cool. To one correspondent I said that this is just thinking out loud, kind of like brainstorming, I don't mind if an idea is half-baked before I present it. Some of the best things that have ever happened in my life came from just such idea-sharing."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Workflow">
				<outline text="Yesterday I spent a bunch of time talking with Robert Scoble, a conference manager at Fawcette, who's very bright and trying to figure out what's going on here, same as me. "/>
				<outline text="One of the questions that keeps coming up is why (or is) what we're doing at UserLand different from the other content management companies, Vignette, ATG, Interwoven, Broadvision. Clearly it is different, if for no other reason that our software costs much less. But that's just the beginning of the story. "/>
				<outline text="One of the elusive features that others provide that we don't is called &quot;workflow.&quot; I wonder why we never implemented it and they did. I wonder why it never showed up on my radar, yet it seems so central to what they do. And then I had an aha. What follows is strong, so don't read it if you can't stand a strong point of view."/>
				<outline text="The purpose of workflow is to keep content off the web. To provide a sense of security to company management that all the right people have to approve something before anyone outside the company can read it. This can include relatively harmless checks, like making sure that Web standards are respected, or it can make sure that the company's lies are preserved, that no truth leaks out from behind the firewall. If every statement has to get through the legal department, top management, human resources, etc, so the theory goes, our company or organization can't get in trouble."/>
				<outline text="Now I understand why it's not in our software. Our job is to make it *easy* for people to get their ideas on to the Web, not hard. If you have layers of editors in your way, I know that this starts warping your personality, to the point where the work becomes tedious even demoralizing. I said a few weeks ago (on &quot;Scripting News&quot;, my weblog) that the Web these guys are writing for is not the same Web I write for, the one I write for depends on people's judgment and recognizes that companies are made up of people, and sometimes people make mistakes. That's preferable, imho, to a story that either never gets told or is told untruthfully."/>
				<outline text="Last week one of my people said something to someone outside the company that made me cringe. I explained to him carefully why I don't want us to say things that way. It could be big trouble. But I didn't put a gag on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jake.editthispage.com/2001/02/25&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt;. I know he cares, and I know he does good work, and that's one of the risks you take by giving your people a voice."/>
				<outline text="I remember when Brent Simmons launched his &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt;, after much prodding from me. I freaked out. &quot;Now I'm not the only public voice of my company on the Web.&quot; But I had a little talk with myself &quot;Dave, you &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; him to do this,&quot; I said. The initial shock is long gone, and now I can't imagine a Web without Brent. He's a fantastic teacher, a great writer, as long as he wants to write publicly, I want to read it, and I want everyone who wants to to be able to."/>
				<outline text="So the bottom-line is that we are different because our natural customers are the people inside an organization, and the content management products are sold to management. Our purpose is to flow stuff out to the Web, and honestly, from my point of view, the other guys' purpose is to *not* flow stuff out to the Web. There's more money in their business, because the management has more money, but there's more Web in our business. "/>
				<outline text="Over and over I learn that the barriers we erected in the past that define workplaces don't work when the Web comes into the equation. We're not the only ones. You can route around content firewalls by starting an eGroup and inviting all interested people outside your company to participate. Instant messaging and email are also route-arounds."/>
				<outline text="So workflow is an illusion, like those silly non-disclosure agreements that firewalls attach to the end of outgoing (public) emails. The Web is revolutionary, it's hard to sell security with integrity when there's a revolution (still) going on."/>

				<outline text="If the next version of the Internet is to work, there are going to be lots more platform vendors. This is a key point. Every Web service is a platform, and each of us has choice: to be a competitor, developer or user of that platform; or to ignore it altogether. That's the nature of the Internet. Now, it's the nature of human beings to reinvent the wheel, but let's hope we can overcome some of that. "/>
				<outline text="There is progress and harmony, happiness and forward motion when we build on each others' accomplishments. In other words, to have happy house, respect must go both ways. Husband must buy flowers for wives, and wives must not try to change husband. Then the arguments and struggles can end and we will raise beautiful happy children and tackle larger problems."/>
				<outline text="Now of course someone is going to say &quot;What a dreamer, get real.&quot; Well, I'd like to give peace a chance, and see what we can accomplish when we stop wasting so much time stopping things, and invest more energy in working together, creating new stuff, and dealing with some of the big problems on our plate."/>

			<outline text="Microsoft">
				<outline text="This column began in 1994 with the story of Microsoft, routed around by the Internet, in a stunning reversal, all of a sudden the giant software company had to scramble. It took a full year after my public epiphany for Microsoft to get it, and when they did, they attacked as if their life depended on it. This attack eventually landed them in court with a judgment that they be broken up, and sadly it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/538066.asp&quot;&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; that judgment is headed for the scrap heap, and now the question comes up where are we all headed now? "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A review">
				<outline text="Every time I use the Web I am reminded why I hate Microsoft. "/>
				<outline text="What could have been a lovely competitive space, overseen and supported by a statesman-like Microsoft, turned into a cesspool of lawyers and dirty tricks. If Microsoft had stayed out, Netscape would have gotten entrepreneurial competition, we now know how flawed their engineering was, they would have hit the wall, but Microsoft's cut-throat tactics  gave Andreessen and Company the excuse they needed to exit, and now it's a one-party-system and innovation must look outside the Web. "/>
				<outline text="In my mind this is the result of the greed and paranoid fear of Microsoft culture, for the Web to die this death required them to thoughtlessly and relentlessly attack, over and over. They point the finger at Silicon Valley culture, the land of the corner-cut, and they're right about that, but it's sleight of hand, it doesn't absolve them of &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; responsibility. "/>
				<outline text="Microsoft had another chance to make peace with developers, the WORA pitch that was delivered in disgrace by McNealy, Joy et al, really hit a nerve with developers who didn't want to be controlled by the gorillas and titans. As usual, Microsoft's response was to crush and kill, and now WORA is a lost dream. "/>
				<outline text="To this day they think the battle over Java was with Sun, when it was really with the developers. Microsoft says they love developers, they live for developers, and at some level I believe them. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I don't think they have a clue how their actions cripple the developers. Some of the Microsoft people deserve that benefit, others imho, don't. "/>

			<outline text="A puzzle">
				<outline text="To me Microsoft is a puzzle. I've had many friends at Microsoft over the years. On an individual basis we have so much in common. In a way I am a Microsoft person, the same way I'm an American. I've lived with Microsoft for my whole career as a software developer. I started at roughly the same time Bill Gates did. "/>
				<outline text="When we were struggling to get Apple to listen in the early 90s, Microsoft invited me to participate in the design of COM, and I accepted, and we did it, and I'm glad we did, even though we arrived with Windows software after the Internet took hold, and didn't get a chance to take advantage of our investment in COM."/>
				<outline text="A few years later when the invitation came to work with them on SOAP, I jumped at the opportunity, and this time we didn't miss the window, we're right in the middle of it, and I'm determined for it not to become the competitive cesspool that the early Internet became."/>
				<outline text="I have trouble reconciling the two Microsoft cultures I see. Behind the scenes there are (some) reasonable bright-eyed people. But actions speak louder than words. And the actions have been pretty awful."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="SOAP and interop">
				<outline text="I helped create &lt;a href=&quot;http://soap.weblogs.com/faq&quot;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; for a purpose. It was and in mind still is, the peace treaty between independent developers and Microsoft and other would-be controlling platform vendors. However that still is unrealized potential. The SOAP spec is broad enough that a developer can implement an application that conforms yet still does not interoperate with other implementations."/>
				<outline text="We're now squarely in the interop period for SOAP. What happens in the next few weeks and months will determine whether it's a revolution or just another battleground for the lawyers and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=maneuver&quot;&gt;maneuverers&lt;/a&gt;. In order for it to work, a fundamental change must happen at Microsoft. They must let the independent developers run the show."/>
				<outline text="And don't miss this, the independent developers have to change too. We tend to look up to make deals. We all want to work with the boss, but few of us want to work with each other. That's a bug folks. If we work together we run the show. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Plan B">
				<outline text="If SOAP becomes a battlefield of the giants and titans, evolving at a pace that suits them, the little guys can ignore the michegas and route around them. There are a lot more of us than there are of them. So far we've been poorly organized and not very good at helping each other. I don't know if that will change, but there are hopeful signs. "/>
				<outline text="The open source community has discovered SOAP's older brother, &quot;XML-RPC&quot;, and embraced it. If we can all work together, Microsoft and Sun can split the developers who want to be spoon-fed, and the adventurous developers who want to achieve the promise of the Internet can work together. This is my hope. "/>
				<outline text="As Benjamin Franklin, one of the founders of my country, said: &quot;We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Lots of Dot-Nets">
				<outline text="People stare at me in disbelief when I say that there will be lots of Dot-Nets. There will be. First there was one. There will be two, for sure, we're finishing ours now, it's called Radio. And then everyone else will know how to do it too. Microsoft, perhaps unwittingly has cast the first seed in what must be a bootstrap that crosses all operating systems and economic systems, without Microsoft's control."/>
				<outline text="It's easy to zig to their zag. Microsoft's platform has every programming language known to man. Ours has one. Theirs works with SQL databases. Ours has a built-in object database. Theirs doesn't have a Web content management system. Ours does. Theirs doesn't run on the Mac. Ours does. Theirs comes from Microsoft, ours does not."/>
				<outline text="Of course Java is a Dot-Net. Look at all the languages they have running in Java. It talks to SQL databases. It runs on Macs and Unix too. It also does not come from Microsoft. "/>
				<outline text="Zope is a Dot-Net too. Two languages at last count. An object database, a Web interface. Open source. Apache is also a foundation for Dot-Nets, as is PHP, Perl, Python and C, and every other environment that's wiring up to the new formats and protocols."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="SOAP is a seed">
				<outline text="SOAP is a seed. Let's make it bloom, and let's get rid of the notion that creativity can be captured. We have a clear choice. Independent developers or no creativity. I want interop to be inclusive, for our &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$5177&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; to work with Microsoft's and Sun's and IBM's SOAP implementations. They can be creative too, please, but no dominance. Been there done that, it's boring and deadly."/>
				<outline text="I still am optimistic. But the attitude at Microsoft that independent developers don't count, the attitude that caused so much trouble in the past, is totally still there. I begrudgingly use Microsoft's browser. Every time I launch it I think how much I hate Microsoft. There's a lot of damage to be undone, and I don't think Microsoft gets it."/>
				<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
				<outline text="PS: WORA stands for Write Once Run Anywhere. If delivered it would have given developers choice between operating systems and neutralize the control of operating system vendors."/>
				<outline text="PPS: I started a directory for SOAP developers. http://www.soapware.org/. If your software or service isn't listed, please send a suggested link. "/>
				<outline text="PPPS: I also wrote a SOAP validator. http://validator.soapware.org/. If my software interops with yours we are stronger against the titans. Interop now. There's never been a better time."/>

He said Intel was going to spend its way through the recession. What a great idea. A dollar goes a lot further today than it did a year ago. The competition has been dramatically reduced. You can actually rent office space in Silicon Valley, and you can hire good people. It's turned into a buyer's market.

			<outline text="The epicenter?">
				<outline text="In ZDNet, a common theme: &quot;Open Source software has been the epicenter of some of the greatest innovations of our industry -- namely, the Internet. And these innovations have benefited Microsoft handsomely. Sound ridiculous? Let me explain.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2693472,00.html"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It does sound ridiculous">
				<outline text="Open source is fine, but to say that open source created today's Internet is to ignore TeachText, Notepad, BBEdit, Homesite, FrontPage, Pagemill, Winamp, Windows, Mac OS, Google, eBay, Amazon, Yahoo, Outlook, Flash, PhotoShop, Oracle, Sybase, Access, Filemaker, Eudora, Netscape, Opera, Cold Fusion, Manila, Blogger, MSIE, the AOL client, ICQ, AOL IM, Visual Studio, Metrowerks, Java, Napster, Vignette, Dreamweaver, the list goes on and on. None of these projects are open source. "/>
				<outline text="Another point to consider. HyperCard is often credited as part of Tim Berners-Lee's inspiration for the World Wide Web. Like many of the hypertext projects in the late 1980s, Hypercard was not open source."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A murky past">
				<outline text="And it isn't even fair to say that the Internet was created by open source developers, because the term &quot;open source&quot; was coined after the software was developed, in 1997. Prior to that, many Internet developers gave away source code because that's what made sense to them, but then, so did many commercial developers. Some environments, like AppleSoft Basic, didn't offer the option *not* to release source code. The past is so murky, it's highly simplistic to say that early infrastructure software was open source. The term did not even exist when the software was created, its philosophy had not been stated or agreed to, by the developers."/>

			<outline text="Overstated differences">
				<outline text="The differences between the two worlds are often overstated. To this day many open source projects welcome commercial development. Notable examples are Apache, Jabber, Perl and Python. "/>
				<outline text="One may prefer open source products, and choose to support them to the exclusion of commercial products, that's fine, but to be fair recognize the contribution of all flavors of developers, even if you don't use their software, and of course we can return the respect."/>
				<outline text="Professional and ethical programmers are generous people by nature. Like lawyers and doctors who do pro bono work, many commercial developers moonlight as open source developers. There are often good business reasons to be open with source, but it's always important to be open with formats and  protocols, and our minds."/>

				<outline text="I spent all of today talking with people inside and outside of Microsoft, about Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="Nothing new, the world's largest software company commands quite a bit of attention."/>
				<outline text="But communicating, really communicating with and about this company is quite difficult."/>
				<outline text="So much of the discussion is about intention, the quality or color of their heart, but this is a ridiculous thing to discuss. It's a teenager's argument, or a young man's argument, it's not something for adults to talk about. "/>
				<outline text="A company has no heart. We like to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=anthropomorphize&quot;&gt;anthropomorphize&lt;/a&gt; everything, but geez, this is a collection of 45,000 people of all ages, from lots of  backgrounds. We could talk about the people as individuals, but that would be meaningless too. None of them have any power to change the thing we call Microsoft. They can try, I can try, and it's for nought. Nothing can change them, so nothing will change."/>
				<outline text="Nonetheless, I have to make a decision. I've sought help with this decision from people in Silicon Valley, from friends outside the industry, and no one can help me, it seems. I think few people think I actually have a decision. I'll try to explain."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What about SOAP?">
				<outline text="I know people are paying attention to SOAP in Silicon Valley, more than I ever thought they would. But what is it that they're paying attention to?"/>
				<outline text="Is it a way to hook into Microsoft's next generation of software? Or is it something greater?"/>
				<outline text="Another way of asking the question -- is it the next generation of COM, one that runs over the Internet, or is it the next layer on the Internet itself?"/>
				<outline text="Ponder that for a moment. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The COM branch">
				<outline text="Let's say it's the next generation of COM. "/>
				<outline text="What do I do then? This is a no-brainer. It's easy. Just kick back and let Microsoft's evangelists and technical diplomats do their work. My company will support it, of course, as we support Windows, and so will many others. But it will be up to Microsoft to make it work in the market, I can't help them do this."/>
				<outline text="So if the answer is that it is the next version of COM and nothing more, then I know what I have to do. But I hope it's more."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The next layer of the Internet branch">
				<outline text="Think of the Internet as an onion. At its core are the ancient protocols, the lizard brain of the Internet. TCP is at the core (maybe something is even deeper than that, but I have no idea what it is). The next layer out is DNS, which is an application of TCP. "/>
				<outline text="At the next layer are SMTP, FTP, POP, which depend on both TCP and DNS. More layers until you get to HTTP, and then HTML and GIF and JPEG, to the inner layers these look like mere content, but to the people working on outer layers they look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=substrate&quot;&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt;, the basic ingredients that form the next level."/>
				<outline text="Now near the outermost layer of the onion is XML 1.0. It's truly a marvel. A lovely specification, frozen in time, never-to-change, and it's so damned flexible, and so completely specified. Every day I work with XML I thank the gods for their gift. It works so well. Thank you. But XML 1.0 is no longer the outermost layer, there's another layer flickering into existence."/>
				<outline text="There are two forks. One is called XML-RPC, and the other is called SOAP. "/>
				<outline text="Which one will be the next layer of the Internet, or will either of them be?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The BigCo's">
				<outline text="Now the big companies, Microsoft, IBM, Sun, Oracle, etc, see the world one way, one which I don't understand or want to understand. I made a choice early in my career not to be a company man. I like to create cool stuff and sell it, but I don't fit in at big companies, I don't even like them."/>
				<outline text="I like the Internet because it always seems to screw with the BigCo's plans for world domination. It's like Bugs Bunny or the Roadrunner cartoon characters. The Internet is always too fast and nimble to ever really get captured and eaten by Elmer Fudd or Wile E. Coyote, although in the middle of each episode it *looks* like it's all over."/>
				<outline text="I've learned this much, when a BigCo tells you that they &quot;get&quot; the Internet, what they really mean is they think they've figured out how to own the Internet. And so we go around the loop one more time."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Let's get real">
				<outline text="No one is excited about SOAP because it gets them connectivity to my products. I wish it were otherwise, I think my products deserve that kind of recognition, but I'm a realist, I know that it's Microsoft that's the draw to SOAP. "/>
				<outline text="Because of that, I am wholly impotent to influence the direction of SOAP. Until a few weeks ago, when the number of implementations started exploding, that was my theory. But then something happened, I got inspired and put up a validator app, and then people started asking me questions about interop, and people asked me to organize an interop event for May, and I got confused, and thought this meant somehow that I had some say in the future of SOAP."/>
				<outline text="Now I think that I've been asked to be Bert Parks at the Miss America pageant. A contest, rigged perhaps, with blushing runner-ups and here she is, Miss America, I would sing, as a beautiful young woman accepted a crown and a bouquet of roses, with the orchestra playing along and everyone in the audience beaming in delight. "/>
				<outline text="This is what I promised I would never do. If I ever get on a stage with Microsoft, it would mean something. I wouldn't stand up and say this is an Internet standard when it's nothing of the sort."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Even more real">
				<outline text="Internet standards happen quickly while no one is looking."/>
				<outline text="I don't know the actual history of each layer, but I'd bet my Master's degree that it's true of every standard we use now. Done in the quiet, dark, somewhat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=fetid&quot;&gt;fetid&lt;/a&gt; room of a Lone Geek, programming into the wee hours, only interrupted by the occasional janitor or trip to the fridge for another caffeinated drink."/>
				<outline text="Now this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the story of SOAP. It's been a political football for three years, and the struggle shows no signs of abating. We now have 39 implementations that are not known to interop. And the BigCo's are acting like BigCo's and to their credit, are showing impressive signs of working together, among themselves, but there aren't many Lone Geeks in the loop."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is the Internet saying?">
				<outline text="I have a very small company, so small that in contrast to the BigCo's I'm basically a Lone Geek. I have tried the best I can to get them to work with us, but it's entirely been a one-way street -- they leak to us the things we're supposed to do, long after they've started doing them. And when we propose things we should do together, there's not been a response since the first query in early 1998. There's a remarkable imbalance, and of course since I'm not a BigCo, and don't work for one, what I want to do matters not one bit, net-net."/>
				<outline text="Sometimes I think this is the Internet saying to me &quot;Your work is done here.&quot; "/>

			<outline text="Chicago's Cubs fans">
				<outline text="Sidebar. I grew up a Mets fan, always in the cellar of the of the National League, unless the Chicago Cubs were there. We Mets fans had a bond with the Cubs fans, and in some ways they had a cooler stadium because they had outfield bleachers."/>
				<outline text="When an opposing team hit a home run, the tradition at Wrigley Field was to throw the ball back on the field, as if rejecting the home run. &quot;We have better things to do, we're too busy to deal with this now&quot; the Cubs fans seemed to be saying. Of course if Shea Stadium had bleachers like this we would have done the same, I'm sure."/>
				<outline text="Now what I love about this is the arrogance of the disempowered. We have no power, us cellar-dwellers, us independent developers. But we can be arrogant anyway. ;-&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="So here's my query">
				<outline text="What is SOAP?"/>
				<outline text="Is it a Microsoft spec, or is it a layer of the Internet?"/>
				<outline text="Do we join XML-RPC with SOAP, or simply use XML-RPC and throw the SOAP ball back onto the field. Or do we take ownership of SOAP, thanking Microsoft for their contribution, and make it the next layer of the Internet, including the BigCo's, but not allowing them to call the shots. Or do we remain in the gutters and under the bridges grousing about the BigCo's and their greed. Or do we do something fun and empowering and out of character?"/>
				<outline text="It's a remarkably fluid point in time. I think the BigCo's are confused. If the Internet has something to say about this, please say it."/>
				<outline text="I'm listening."/>

				<outline text="Then I did an experiment, I sent a pointer to that page to a few industry pundits to share my glee in such open developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt;. I said it was a Mind Bomb, but nothing more. "/>
				<outline text="Eric S Raymond, the open source writer, asked for an in-context explanation. That's what I would have done if I didn't understand. Here's what I said to him."/>
				<outline text="&quot;It's the hacker ethic at work. Interop is slow to come on the recommended path. So the Lone Hacker takes things into his own hands and links the Big Product to the indy network that had interop a year ago, painlessly, because the spec is so low-tech and easy.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Now only one reader in 50 is going to appreciate this. Remember the open bathtub analogy? It's as if a single developer, in frustration, unplugged the tub, which was supposed to always be open. It's as if the developers are saying resistance is futile. Open is open, and always will be simple."/>
				<outline text="One more thought. The magic of the Web, HTTP and HTML, its utter simplicity, is based on its willingness to acknowledge broken links. This is something the big companies can never accept. But low tech always rules, it always has, it's only been an illiusion that everything could work outside of Murphy's Law, and a new (proposed) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=corollary&quot;&gt;corollary&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;You can't beat Murphy, so stop trying.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="Apple started it, back in the 1980s, with its friendly Macintosh, with an ease-of-use culture that crept into the developer documentation, which was a marvel of clarity. The Mac's super-simple programming model was described by the phonebook-size Inside Macintosh, followed by a small bookshelf of addenda that over the years got less friendly as the original Macintosh pioneers left and were replaced from the general talent pool of Silicon Valley, such as it is."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Silicon Valley">
				<outline text="What a place of contrasts. Just forty years ago there was little here but fruit orchards and Stanford University. In springtime you can smell the few remaining fruit trees as the air fills with the smell of their flowers. This is that time of year in Silicon Valley, for the next few weeks it's like living in a perfume factory, perhaps just a shadow of its former opulence, but luxurious nonetheless."/>
				<outline text="Silicon Valley has been through four huge bursts of growth, speading out each time. Just like the Internet, the Valley is an onion, with the aerospace industry, chips, software, consultants and portals. Billboards that line its main artery, Highway 101, tell the story. The city at the south of the Valley, San Jose, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jmawired.com/main/sanjose.htm&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; MAE-WEST lives, 40 percent of the world's Internet traffic flows through San Jose; and up north are the artists and Hollywood types. Inbetween, in Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto, Atherton, Redwood City, Burlingame, Daly City, are everything inbetween that's technnology related."/>

			<outline text="myParagraph">
				<outline text="Back to Inside Macintosh, which was written in Silicon Valley. The docs were written for Pascal programmers, the more verbose dialect of Algol, the slightly older brother of the more concise C. Their variables needed names, so they called them things like myPort, myHandle, myMenu, myMouseLocation. At first I thought this was stupid, but eventually I drank the Kool Aid, and now I too put &quot;my&quot; in front of lots of my things."/>

			<outline text="Aggregators">
				<outline text="I've spent the last three years learning how to write aggregators, Internet programs that read lots of XML things and make it easy for users to configure flows from those things, and then late last year figured out how to make it easy for them to create their own output flows. Other kinds of aggregators are search engines, directories, weblogs, home pages."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="ourFavoriteSongs">
				<outline text="The next step, when living in AggregatorLand, as I often do, is ourCalendar, ourDirectory, and ourWeblogs. Some things will always be &quot;my&quot; like the mouse and keyboard and my social security number. But much of the data and software we use will be &quot;our&quot;. That's why we started a site called OurFavoriteSongs, using the term &quot;song&quot; liberally, believing that anything creative or interesting can be thought of as a song. Clearly there's room for poetry in our software."/>

I was briefed on their announcement on Thursday and am under non-disclosure until Microsoft makes the announcement at 10AM Pacific today. "/>
				<outline text="They will surely get people thinking. That's a very good thing for people to do. What would you like the next layer to look like and what would you like it to do for you? Even more important, what would you like to do for the Internet?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Interop">
				<outline text="At the same time, we will formally announce Radio UserLand, imho &quot;a turning point for the Internet.&quot; We're making progress on the process for SOAP-level interop, allowing as many developers as possible to hook up to HailStorm, Radio, and any other ideas that may or may not catch on. The goal is to give developers choices, so that they in turn can give choices to users. "/>
				<outline text="Over the weekend we figured out, with the help of several Microsoft people who use Radio, how our stacks will connect. The benefits of our mutual investment in XML is paying off now. In the sub-head of our press release we say &quot;Microsoft collaboration continues to deliver results for Web users.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No lock-in">
				<outline text="Like all previous layers of the Internet, there will be no lock-in in the next layer. When I ask the Internet where it wants to go today, that answer comes back loud and clear.

				<outline text="Some people say weblogs are just for teenagers to talk about cars, music and boyfriends and girlfriends. Well, they are good at that, for sure, but when a big story like HailStorm goes through the technology industry, you can see the instant publishing power of weblogs at work."/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2001/03/19&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt; of the San Jose Mercury-News was one of the first tech journalists to take up weblogging, and he got the first review of HailStorm on the Web, straight from Building 33 in Redmond. &quot;[HailStorm is] the most centralized thing I've seen in years, from a company that hooted down the idea of the Network Computer until the concept suddenly seemed to translate into a multi-billion-dollar annuity income for our favorite monopolist.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Next was &lt;a href=&quot;http://release1.edventure.com/conversation/content.cfm?Counter=1029156&quot;&gt;Kevin Werbach&lt;/a&gt; of Release 1.0. &quot;Microsoft today launched its Hailstorm Web services initiative. Worth watching closely, if for no other reason than that it ties together virtually every hot topic in the computer industry today: distributed computing, component software, instant messaging, online privacy, the post-PC world, user-centric interfaces, you name it.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="On the mail lists and discussion groups the conversation quickly gets to the core. What is Microsoft doing in its centralized closed box that we can't do for ourselves, openly, and distributed, with no promise of privacy, but a full promise of freedom of choice? This is the question I have been waiting for. I think an independent framework will develop alongside Microsoft's and the frameworks proposed by the other BigCo's (this is sure to come). "/>
				<outline text="The beautiful thing about SOAP is that if Microsoft does it right, there's no reason the independent network can't bridge to the Microsoft-controlled network. We will publish data from our world into their cloud, which is of course the point of publishing. Our stuff will be public, the stuff people &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to distribute, and theirs will be private, guaranteed by the largest software company in the world, which as Dan has pointed out, bit off quite a hunk there in that promise. (Murphy's Law and all.)"/>

				<outline text="The last week has been Learn About Microsoft Week for me and a lot of other people. The HailStorm announcement is a shocker, no matter how much MS had prepped us for it, and MS &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; do a lot of prepping, the moment it all came together, and the position it put MS in, was shocking. I think that's all the take-away one can get from the posts on the mail lists, the articles and editorials in various pubs."/>
				<outline text="On Thursday, when I got my briefing, I knew it would be heavy. It made me laugh to think of all the brains that would be activated. Yesterday was one of the most whirling days we've had in a long time. We use to whirl regularly. Remember when Netscape went open source? When we first learned about SlashDot? Go all the way back to the beginning of the story, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/13/lettertocannavino&quot;&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1994/10/27/replyfrombillgates&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 and 1995. We liked it then, but we've gotten sleepy. Now something is coming awake?"/>
				<outline text="I see this happen in our own world when we release something we've been planning for months, sometimes years, and thinking we were carefully telegraphing our intentions, for naught (it seems), the people who follow what we do have a Learn About UserLand Week or two (sometimes more) and they're shocked, just like we were last week. That's about all the take-away you can do. They want to know how they fit in now that they understand where we're going. From our pov it's where we've &lt;i&gt;been going,&lt;/i&gt; their shock happens when we're exhausted from shipping, there's an impedence mismatch, high current flowing on one side, almost none on the other.

				<outline text="After almost thirteen years working on Frontier, I have no advice to offer Microsoft, other than it will pass, and we'll get together and see where the chips are now that the game has been re-arranged.

				<outline text="Before digging back through HailStorm, let's note the passing of Napster as a free-for-all of music on the Internet. Like so many giddy Internet-like things, Napster crashed into harsh reality, and now you can only get a small fraction of the music that used to be available. "/>
				<outline text="A really sad event. The music industry could have done something creative, but well it didn't happen. Sometimes I wonder if it's a coincidence that the Internet bubble burst at the same time that Napster crashed into the RIAA. "/>

				<outline text="There's so much music that can be played to the tune of HailStorm, because there's so much fearful stuff out there, songs about lost love, or Phil Collins' pleas for just one more chance, Billy Joel's New York State Of Mind, or Tracy Chapman's &quot;give me just one reason to stay here.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="What is Hailstorm?">
				<outline text="HailStorm is a centralized storage system that behaves much like a hard disk. It can store calendars, address books, documents, programs, graphics, spreadsheets. "/>
				<outline text="But, instead of storing information in HTML as the Web does, it stores information in XML, which can be rendered as HTML, or in any other form. "/>
				<outline text="This is a key difference from earlier Internet-based storage systems, it's not exactly a first, but it's bold and comes from a big company with lots of resources and staying power, unlike some of the Internet pioneers who gave users storage space and monetized it (theoretically it turns out) with advertising."/>
				<outline text="&lt;i&gt;&quot;Ring the bell, hard to tell, if anything is gonna sell.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's centralized">
				<outline text="The key word in the description of HailStorm above is &quot;centralized.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="It's weird that Microsoft is going this way, it lacks courage, it lacks philosophy, it's not consistent with what Microsoft already knows about the Internet, imho."/>
				<outline text="Last year in Davos Bill Gates said that &quot;thin clients&quot; as promoted by Oracle and Sun were the wrong way to go and I heartily agreed, and still do. Bill is making a strategic mistake. It's historic, and he's a student of history. I must explain."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Remember the mainframes?">
				<outline text="This industry loops. I've documented it so many times. When I entered the loop, in the 70s, computers were centralized resources, separated from the people by &quot;glass palaces,&quot; air-conditioned rooms with raised floors and whirring tape drives, and well-meaning people who kept people from their data. "/>
				<outline text="Along comes the Apple II and VisiCalc, decentralization, people get control of the data. The mainframe guys, watching in disbelief, say &quot;It will never work.&quot; They thought users couldn't be trusted with the data. People going home with floppies containing sensitive corporate data. They predicted a meltdown that may or may not have come, but we adapted and survived anyway. The lesson was clear, the economy would shift to accomodate new power. "/>
				<outline text="Interestingly, Microsoft grew into this shift to decentralization in the 80s. Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer know the process very well. It's the back door sell."/>
				<outline text="&lt;i&gt;&quot;Johnny's in the basement mixin up the medicine, I'm on the pavement thinkin about the government.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Remember the back door">
				<outline text="Apple II's were so cheap that departments could buy one for every person and no one would know. In the meantime, IBM, DEC and other mainframe companies were selling to the top, the front door, and working down from there. You can never get fired for buying IBM so the top guys bought and were fired. (Murphy!)"/>
				<outline text="IBM got hip and sold through the back door just like Apple, and dominated the PC industry for a few years with a 640K barrier and RAM cram, but they couldn't leave well enough alone, they tripped over their arrogance, along came the PS/2 and its proprietary Micro-Channel Architecture, opening the door for Microsoft to take the top of the hill with Windows 3.0. Whew. What a story. About to be repeated."/>
				<outline text="&lt;i&gt;&quot;Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="More history">
				<outline text="OK, then the personal computing revolution solidified, a new generation of information system managers came in, and just as they're figuring out how to protect the users from themselves, along comes the Web to screw it all up. Microsoft rushes to crush the rebellion, leaving behind a bookmark, &quot;When we're done with this we'll go back to 1993,&quot; they seem to be remembering now."/>
				<outline text="My old friend Dick Brass' mark is all over this. I don't think Dick remembers the copy protection skirmish on the way to Windows 3.0, but we can't go home, Kansas is gone, the bookmarks age, the cache is empty, embrace and what was that strategy? It doesn't work anymore. We got hip to that."/>
				<outline text="&lt;i&gt;&quot;The pump don't work because the vandals took the handles.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Zig or zag?">
				<outline text="So here's Microsoft's conundrum. They're IBM now. They sell through the top. But the back door is wide open. Shhh. Don't tell anyone. ;-&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Many users are now Internet-savvy enough to run servers on their desktops. We don't need a centralized XML server, that's a solution to the problem of 1993, not 2002. We've learned how to aggregate and distribute information without central control. It's ready for a mass market. "/>
				<outline text="While users have been learning the Internet, server software has gotten much simpler and more powerful, so the barrier is lower, and the incentive greater. These tracks are headed for destiny. "/>
				<outline text="The next microcomputer is just software using the standards of the Internet, XML, HTTP, SMTP and perhaps instant messaging, and today's IT managers are last generation's MIS managers, plugging dikes, with Microsoft's help, as their ancestors had IBM's, but the flood will come anyway."/>

			<outline text="Introduction">
				<outline text="This has been an unusually heavy week in the politics of SOAP 1.1 interop. As I've been working I've been taking notes in a series of documents that I call Dave's SOAP Journal. This essay is a set of lightly edited excerpts from that journal. I want to help people see the human side of the technical work. If there's something you don't understand, just go right through it, I'll see if I can address people's questions in a followup piece."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Where we're at with SOAP interop">
				<outline text="Imho, it's going to take a miracle and a lot of compromise for SOAP to coalesce into a single protocol that interops. The spec for SOAP, of which I am a co-author, is not the best spec in the world. It's got lots of mistakes and contradictions, and it points to other specs which are moving targets. "/>
				<outline text="There's a mail list where SOAP interop is being discussed among implementors. It's a fascinating place because there are lots of small developers, like my company, UserLand, and two or three really large companies, and more showing up every day. It's like a baseball game where everyone showed up with a mitt, a glove, a ball and a bat, ready to play, but the rulebook was written by an evil non-athletic lunatic. We all seem to want to work together but the blueprint is in the way."/>
				<outline text="Adding to the confusion, Microsoft and IBM, apparently thinking it was solely up to them to decide what SOAP is, added a complex layer called WSDL, in private, without consulting anyone I know, and there's an idea that it is somehow related to the base layer for interop. To be fair, some independent developers agree with them. I have no interest in spending months writing code to support something whose benefits are so vague. On the other hand, when I ask that they support XML-RPC syntax, they say they don't have the resources."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, today, there is no single thing called SOAP, when you look at reality there are &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of things people call SOAP, and they don't work together. Now maybe that will change, I hope so, but that's where we are right now."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A loop">
				<outline text="This is a loop for me. In the old days before the Internet we tried playing this game with Microsoft and Apple on the Mac. They would always cut the deck 26 cards for Microsoft, 26 cards for Apple, and we'd always end up saying &quot;Whoooa, where are &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; cards?&quot; I learned then that the gorillas appear to be saying they're doing things that they're not doing and vice versa. "/>
				<outline text="There's always a moment of surprise when you find out that assuming the worst was the right way to think. But back then I didn't have a website to document this stuff, and I didn't have &quot;XML-RPC&quot; as a great insurance policy against such misbehavior. All they can do is screw SOAP, they can't screw the independent developers if we act in our own interests. (But that's a big if.)"/>
				</outline>

				<outline text="The road to completion is infinite when you play the gorilla's game. You'll always still need to do One More Thing to be cool. And when you do it, they'll break the deal anyway. Claude Bullard &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200103/msg01013.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of a similar process in the W3C &quot;Thou shalt not deploy anything that has not been deployed before you deploy except if said deployment shall slow the deployment of the fastest among you.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Playing the gorilla's game you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; be first. They always get to be first, no matter what."/>
				<outline text="Now some of the developers involved in SOAP shrug their shoulders and accept the dominance of the gorillas as &quot;reality&quot;. It's not reality. Don't believe it. These are struggling companies with no philosophy. It might be possible to make a few bucks doing what they want you to do, but in the end it's a losing strategy. "/>
				<outline text="XML-RPC did not go away, even though they would like to believe it did. Interop is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an elusive thing, it's here now. Just cut bait and switch gears and work with other developers, as Benjamin Franklin observed &quot;We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="So what's the take-away on this? I'm still working on interop in SOAP. I will not do WSDL. We will do RPC with SOAP, using SOAP syntax as we use XML-RPC syntax. Let's interop at that level. And if there's noise from the BigCo's that somehow this isn't enough, remember that they have infinite time and infinite money and we have neither."/>

				<outline text="Talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulandrews.manilasites.com&quot;&gt;Paul Andrews&lt;/a&gt; the other day I asked if this stuff was going over his head. I'm trying to make it understandable to people with non-technical backgrounds. We have a seat at one of the most interesting tables in 2001, perhaps &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; most interesting table. I want my experiences to be transparent, I want all the glitches, near-flames and full-flames to be out in the open so we can resolve our differences. "/>
				<outline text="Others are not seeing it the same way, and are working in private, and in doing so disempowering people they don't include. I give you my word that my role in all discussions and my thoughts and pushback will be visible. I can't stop and answer all questions, there isn't enough time, but later when people ask how this happened, you'll be able to see what I did, even if you can't see what others did. "/>
				<outline text="This method has worked well in every stage of SOAP, the only times we got in trouble was when the decisions were made behind closed doors. I believe you can see that result in the SOAP 1.1 spec which is a marvel of compromise and confusion. Our job is to clear that up so we can all move forward compatibly. I want a spec that's a marvel of clarity and ease-of-implementation. I want the barrier to entry for SOAP to be as low as possible, so as not to favor Microsoft, which has many thousands of programmers."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Two choices">
				<outline text="I see two choices. The first is to document the common elements of various SOAP implementations we've been working to interop with. The second choice is to punt on that and define a SOAP envelope for XML-RPC messages. "/>
				<outline text="The advantage of the first approach is that it's kind to SOAP and won't jar the existing SOAP community, which is large and confused. "/>
				<outline text="The advantage of the second is that it opens the gates for all the XML-RPC implementors to participate in the SOAP world, with a minimum investment. I believe our energy is very much needed in the SOAP world. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Microsoft">
				<outline text="Wednesday morning, 7AM."/>
				<outline text="As a Mac developer, I could admire Microsoft from a distance, even though they played the BigCo game in Apple's space at the expense of the SmallCo's (Apple did it too). I admired Microsoft because they were smarter than Apple about technology. But as I've gotten closer to Microsoft, the same thing has happened with me that has happened with virtually everyone else that's tried to work with them. "/>
				<outline text="I've come to see them primarily as a bully that uses its advantage at every step, whether they need to or not, to achieve their goals, and they play on peoples' ignorance and willingness to believe that somehow they're special, that Microsoft respects them even as they dis the others. Even in an area that's probably of minor significance to them, they don't &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; show restraint, repeated calls for them to back off and let people work openly are ignored. "/>
				<outline text="There's lots of offlist activity, and when it emerges Microsoft is always there. &quot;Oh we're just tool vendors,&quot; they like to say. Uh huh. A tool vendor with 45,000 employees, the dominant desktop operating system, and $27 billion in cash."/>
				<outline text="My experience now matches the stories I've heard from others, they must have a playbook for dealing with outsiders, and they stick to it. I don't believe they can participate in an open development process without spoiling it. "/>
				<outline text="I know many people are nodding as they read this, but I had to do the experiment, I'm that kind of guy, I had to get the data. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Survey results">
				<outline text="On Tuesday I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/soapInterop&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; asking Scripting News readers and members of the soapbuilders and xml-rpc lists what they think the outcome of the SOAP interop work will be. "/>
				<outline text="31 percent chose &quot;SOAP will be a balkanized 'standard' with major (or minor) differences between the implementations. There will be a group centered around Java, one around Microsoft, one around independent developers, or some combination thereof. Interop across the 'clubs' will be very problematic, with all groups blaming the others for the lack of interop.&quot; It was the highest-ranked choice."/>
				<outline text="19 percent chose &quot;Works with Microsoft.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="13 percent chose &quot;A simple subset of SOAP will be indentified and documented, much like XML-RPC, but using SOAP envelopes.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="My choice">
				<outline text="I voted with the 13 percent and that's where I'm putting my bet. I'll do some work over the next two days to draft &lt;i&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP 1.1.&lt;/i&gt; If it works, you should be able to adapt an XML-RPC implementation to be a SOAP 1.1 implementation in two sessions, one to get the basic code written, and one to test and debug against a validator. "/>
				<outline text="It's a bet-hedge against the most popular choice. If it's going to be a balkanized standard, I want to be sure that my software is in at least one of the major groups. It would be disastrous for us if we had to go with the &quot;Works With Microsoft&quot; choice. That's a losing proposition. At some point the hoops will get too numerous and we'll have to bow out. Better not to waste any effort on that choice, it's totally unworkable."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Examples">
				<outline text="Last night (Tuesday) I asked Jake to prepare examples for &lt;i&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP 1.1&lt;/i&gt; that, like the XML-RPC spec, will show a developer what a request-response looks like. This will be the core around which the spec is developed. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The first draft is ready">
				<outline text="Wednesday afternoon, 2PM."/>
				<outline text="At first I thought I'd do the writing and then pass it by Jake, but he knows so much more than I do about the twisty maze of SOAP interop, and how big it is, and what the other developers are doing. So we wrote the spec together, me writing and Jake correcting and explaining. It was a great process. We've never worked so closely together, in real-time. Jake is always proving smarter than I thought he was (and I always thought he was smart)."/>
				<outline text="It took about six hours to get the spec done, but in those six hours I think we accomplished more than the soapbuilder process would accomplish in six weeks. "/>
				<outline text="At about 2PM we passed a pointer over to Simon Fell to review. He's also been involved in the interop process on a daily basis, and has been working closely with Jake. "/>
				<outline text="I am now confident that I understand all I need to know to get SOAP interop at least among the developers who &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; interop, more than they want to be friends with Microsoft. I would love to see Microsoft say they're going to support the Busy Developer's Guide, and then we're done, and we can get back to adding features and fixing bugs (and adding bugs) to our software, which is how we earn our paychecks. I'm sure this is something a Microsoft person could understand."/>

				<outline text="As I've admonished people for not working in the open, a simple thought occurred to me re the BigCo's and the way they work with the SmallCo's. "/>
				<outline text="Another way of seeing the Internet. Sometimes it distills down to a single sentence and here it is."/>
				<outline text="&quot;The Internet is the Intranet for The Rest of Us.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Working in the open is the only way to achieve interop. When this is done if all parties are enabled we'll have a strong standard. If the work is done privately we'll have a balkanized standard. I think it's that simple."/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon!">
				<outline text="Lots more intense work on SOAP interop and the Busy Developer's Guide, but we're going to take a break from all that with my friend Paul Andrews, who was, until early this year, the Seattle Times technology correspondent. Now Paul is living in San Francisco with his wife Cecile and their poodle-like dog Maggie and freelancing for The New York Times. "/>
				<outline text="Paul has also become a blogger, in his spare time, running a site using our Manila software. We've assembled, by accident not by plan quite an interesting group of professional journalists, including Paul, moonlighting their way to something new and we're all thinking about what that is. "/>
				<outline text="I invited Paul to write a guest DaveNet piece, and here it is."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Who are your gatekeepers?">
				<outline text="By Paul Andrews, paul@paulandrews.com."/>
				<outline text="Who decides what you read? Your natural response should be, &quot;Why, I do -- of course.&quot; In reality what you read -- and hear, and view -- for the most part undergoes a highly engineered process of filtering, editing and packaging before it reaches your consciousness. Innumerable decisions are made along the way that affect not only what you read, but whether you get to read it at all. The process falls under the heading of &quot;production value,&quot; and decisions about what to print are often termed &quot;gatekeeping.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Traditionally, there have been legitimate reasons for packaging information. Because content was necessarily circumscribed by length, largely out of consideration for distribution and cost, decisions had to be made on what a physical product should contain."/>
				<outline text="The advent of the Internet, and then the Web, radically changed -- eliminated, even -- any physical need to limit content. Length and distribution requirements no longer burden publication considerations. Incremental costs associated with additional volume are minuscule."/>
				<outline text="Yet for the most part, even on the Internet, traditional production values remain in place. The most widely visited news sites -- MSNBC, Yahoo, the Wall Street Journal and so on -- still edit, package and &quot;gatekeep&quot; the information they provide as though they were dealing with a physical product. The articles read like print articles. The online publication mirrors the style, values and biases of its print counterpart."/>
				<outline text="Certainly reasons exist to continue the gatekeeping role. Audiences appreciate production values. Attention spans are hardly infinite. No one knows, for example, why a Grecian play written 2,500 years ago and Hollywood's latest blockbuster happen to run about the same length. But it appears to have something to do with the human's capacity to absorb information."/>
				<outline text="Gradually, things are changing. Not because of any enlightenment on the part of the gatekeepers. Instead, the reading/listening/viewing public is rewarding new approaches that resist conventional media filters. Web-influenced media based on the concept of the raw feed are subtly but radically transforming the way we conduct all information transferral. Into this rubric fall such &quot;revolutionary&quot; concepts as Reality TV, hot-talk radio and &quot;live&quot; broadcasts of things like Supreme Court hearings (voice only, but previously off limits altogether) and Florida vote recounts."/>
				<outline text="Assuming that bandwidth continues to grow while getting cheaper all the time, the role of gatekeeping seems destined to change. It seems likely that the consumer of information will increasingly have access to the real stuff. Traditional definitions of &quot;news,&quot; of public vs. private information, of advertising, and of copyright or protected content will be put to duress."/>
				<outline text="Traditional media are already undergoing strains in the transition. Most have to do with trying to maintain the old ways while accommodating new demands. The San Francisco Chronicle just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/28/BU107431.DTL&amp;type=business&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt;  three staff members over an SFGate (the Chron &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com&quot;&gt;Web site&lt;/a&gt;) column riffing on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillyburbs.com/couriertimes/news/news%5Farchive/808596.htm&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; out of Philadelphia about a teacher having sex with a 13-year-old. The explanation was that the column, despite having an imprimatur for &quot;edginess,&quot; had stepped over the line."/>
				<outline text="Had the commentary appeared in an Internet mailing list or chat room, it would have been considered par for the course if not ho-hum. Far more incendiary issues get discussed on a daily basis. IRC and newsgroups generally lack any gatekeeping function. By the same token, they are more closely analogous to locker-room talk or private correspondence than to traditional publishing. They pose no direct competition to conventional media-audience paradigms."/>
				<outline text="The publishing capabilities of the Web, however, are blurring the production-value lines. A new style of journalism, based on a &quot;raw feed&quot; directly from the source, is emerging. Journalists testing the new waters are, like the Chronicle trio, bound to wreak havoc on institutionalized media. Content that the Chron as a corporation, and the Chron as a newspaper, would not sanction is bound to create tension for the Chron as a Weblog."/>
				<outline text="Should there be different standards governing content for print versus Web publication? And what about the entire notion of gatekeeping -- some &quot;higher power&quot; deciding what is fit for us to read and what is not? Does it disappear entirely in the new Web world of journalism?"/>
				<outline text="It should be noted that the Chronicle episode is consistent with proud journalistic tradition. Since the invention of &quot;news&quot; -- the printed kind, at least -- journalists have been unceasingly proscribed from printing outrageous or unauthorized commentary. In England, early Puritans made such effective use of their &quot;medium&quot; that they had to smuggle a printing press from town to town. There is even the suggestion that their exodus from England to America was at least in part motivated by an effort to assert freedom of the press. The first newspaper in America, &lt;i&gt;Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick,&lt;/i&gt; published in 1690 by Benjamin Harris, was shut down by colonial authorities for printing unsanctioned gossip about the king of France's sex life and a local suicide."/>
				<outline text="In my early days as a reporter, I used the then-still-rare honorific &quot;Ms.&quot; to identify a woman in a story. It was at her request -- she was a Mrs. but wanted Ms. The story ran up through the editorial chain and made the first edition with nothing said back to me. The next thing I knew the city editor was at my desk, waving my copy animatedly. He asked why I had used the term, and I told him."/>
				<outline text="&quot;We're not ready for this yet,&quot; he said. I told him I understood, even though I thought it seemed inevitable that Ms. would have to enter the newspaper lexicon."/>
				<outline text="Boy was I sticking my neck out... Similar stresses occurred when newspapers adapted to terminology involving the gay community and numerous other forms of diversity. The gatekeeping function on what was &quot;printable&quot; had to change, of course, for media to maintain their audience."/>
				<outline text="Now, after years of creative sclerosis in the journalistic community, we're on the verge of another sea change where the rules are radically changing. In fact, it could easily be said there are no rules. We're constructing new ones as we go along. Get any group of Bloggers going online (or even f2f when possible) and you'll find ideas exploding from all quarters -- the adrenalin of new possibilities."/>
				<outline text="But history can prove instructive in charting new waters. The evolution of paper-based journalism may hold some clues as to where Web publishing is headed."/>
				<outline text="Any new medium, it seems, tests its technological waters with purported &quot;news.&quot; In many cases content begins as pure gossip and hearsay, facts so closely interwoven with opinion and half-truths that it is nearly impossible to distinguish truth from interpolation. The coinciding of Columbus' voyage (1492) with the advent of Western movable type (Gutenberg, 1455) raised the &quot;local event&quot; to global scope, but what was significant was how Columbus' content relied on the Blog of his time -- a real ship's log. An early letter by Columbus recounting his adventures was reprinted as a pamphlet and widely distributed though England and Europe -- the first &quot;international bestseller.&quot; It was composed of personal thoughts and observations but treated as the news of the day."/>
				<outline text="A lot of early newspapers were one-person, even first-person, operations which quickly gained enough notice to attract the attention of &quot;authorities.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Early newspapers, no matter what their content, thrived on a decidedly anti-establishment bias. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unionrecord.com/arts/display.php?ID=233&quot;&gt;Mother Jones'&lt;/a&gt; motto, &quot;The purpose of a newspaper is to raise hell,&quot; and Joseph Pulitzer's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eserver.org/filmtv/media-monopoly.txt&quot;&gt;admonition,&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Newspapers should have no friends,&quot; reflected the rebel nature of the medium. (The exception was wartime. As far back as print news extends, it proved wholeheartedly jingoistic in times of conflict. It is remarkable, in fact, how aloof (in some cases admiring) early American coverage of Hitler was, while the U.S. figured out where it stood on the Third Reich.)"/>
				<outline text="Think the Internet is not changing the nature of information? What if &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.annefrank.com/&quot;&gt;Anne Frank&lt;/a&gt; had had a Weblog instead of a diary..."/>
				<outline text="Where the Weblog changes the nature of &quot;news&quot; is in the migration of information from the personal to the public. One to many, circumscribed by voice communications to an immediate circle, then by paper-based text to an institutionalized distribution system, becomes an integrated artifact of any Web communication. Hit the &quot;post&quot; button and any personal writing becomes published writing. I do not pretend to understand all the implications of this. But it seems to me that it breaks down not only the traditional barriers to entry in publishing but the more subtle and inimical barriers to information retrieval as well. Yes, there is too much information out there. And yes, it is a challenge to separate the signal from the noise. "/>
				<outline text="There will always be a role for gatekeepers of our choosing, as is implied in any publisher-reader pact. I have postulated before that Weblog &quot;swarms&quot; will emerge -- bloggers of like minds and values who form virtual ad hoc &quot;publications&quot; around events and trends. But bloggers have the opportunity to conduct the process for ourselves, rather than relying on an official or sanctioned gatekeeper to define truth and beauty for us. As a thousand flowers bloom, the Web's garden of information becomes more diverse, enlightening and transformative than anything the traditional paper-based print world can provide."/>

It ruffled a lot of feathers, but in the end I think most people involved in the process came to see it as a good thing."/>
				<outline text="http://www.soapware.org/bdg"/>
				<outline text="The BDG is kind of a cookbook, written with one audience in mind, busy developers like ourselves, who love to build applications on the Internet, but already have a Day Job. We wrote this document, Jake Savin and myself, simply because we needed it, and in the spirit of the Web, of course we wanted to share it with everyone."/>
				<outline text="That there's a need for such a thing surprises some, considering that the S in SOAP stands for Simple. In fact, SOAP &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; simple, as this document shows, even though coaxing its simplicity from the myriad of related specs and RFCs requires a patience and dedication that most BDs don't have. "/>
				<outline text="Now it's ready. If you've been confused about SOAP, or thought it was a big job to support it, get ready for this, it's not confusing, if you know a little XML and HTTP; it's not a big job. If you know a programmer who's interested in SOAP please point them at the &quot;BDG&quot;. There's a mail list and discussion group to help answer questions.

				<outline text="An interesting article in tomorrow's NY Times, about none other than yours truly, and one of my favorite subjects, Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/09/technology/09HAIL.html"/>
				<outline text="The piece was written by John Markoff, who I've know for many years, and enjoyed working with on this piece."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Comments">
				<outline text="First, it's not as bad as the piece makes it sound."/>
				<outline text="It's true that we hit some rough spots in the interop work we've been doing with Microsoft and others over the last few weeks. It's gone slower than it might have, and Microsoft acted as a BigCo would, and my LittleCo acted as we should, according to our respective sizes."/>
				<outline text="I don't hate Microsoft, all the time. One could read the piece and conclude that I'm an across-the-board Microsoft basher. I am not. I appreciate the collaboration we've done with them, over the last three years and especially over the last few weeks as things got intense. I especially like that they listen. This is rare for a BigCo, and they do it well."/>
				<outline text="On the other hand, the Web &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; sucked into Microsoft, most of us now use Microsoft's browser, and this has not been a good thing for the Web, and it's clearly not in our interest, and I would argue not in Microsoft's, that this happen again. The Internet, and software in general, works best when there's choice for users and freedom for developers. That's the promise of the new layer of the Internet that's in development now. Giving up on independence from Microsoft is not something anyone involved in technology should give up on easily."/>
				<outline text="I'd also like to challenge a minor point in the article, but a major point to me. XML-RPC has not been overtaken, in fact it looks better all the time. Interop in XML-RPC came easily last summer because the spec is so simple and clear. On the other hand, I'm now confident that we will reach interop in SOAP, we're almost all the way there now, and the will to work together appears stronger than ever. This evening, after the piece came out, I emailed with Microsoft's Andrew Layman, who was also interviewed in the Times piece, and confirmed that we're still on track."/>
				<outline text="Finally, it's humbling to see so many of my words in a publication I admire as much as I do the Times. But I'd like to come off as more thoughtful and more dignified. Perhaps I will work on that."/>
				<outline text="&quot;It's even worse than it appears.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="See you tomorrow!"/>

			<outline text="Rebuilding trust">
				<outline text="As you might imagine I spent a lot of time communicating with Microsoft people after yesterday's NY Times &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/09/technology/09HAIL.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, written by John Markoff."/>
				<outline text="The Times piece, while it was good for flow, added confusion that we have to work around because it told the story of a hurdle we had already crossed. So we have to go back and re-do a few steps in building trust. After reading the Times piece, the people I spoke with at Microsoft have a legitimate cause to be confused about where we're at. "/>
				<outline text="Here's where we're at. UserLand has a commitment to work openly on SOAP 1.1 interop. Nothing has changed. Judging from traffic on the soapbuilders list, where interop is being worked on, I'd say everyone else sees it the same way, including Microsoft. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The story shifted">
				<outline text="The Times piece told the story of a lost cause. "/>
				<outline text="Emphatically, that was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; what was happening last week in SOAP 1.1 interop."/>
				<outline text="In a mid-week phone conversation I told Markoff that I thought it would turn out for the best, that we would get fair interop in SOAP 1.1, that there would be room for independent developers to ship products into the space without being &quot;locked in the trunk.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/thursMarkoffEmail.gif&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; to Markoff on Thursday afternoon, I said &quot;I think [Andrew Layman] and others at MS were not expecting what we came up with, but once the initial shock was over, things started working. No doubt there are differences in goals, but I think there's an agreement that this time around the loop, open interfaces is the only way and lots of diversity. Netscape made the issue Microsoft's survival. None of that is here. I really like Microsoft, and have always had a good relationship with them, even when it gets rough. And woe is me if my goal is to somehow defeat MS, that ain't going to happen, I'm into win-wins all around.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="The key quote: &quot;I think there's an agreement that this time around the loop, open interfaces is the only way and lots of diversity.&quot; Last Thursday I was optimistic. I still am. That point of view contradicts the Times' thesis, even though it was expressed to them three days prior to the story running."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Strange ways">
				<outline text="I got the tiniest peek into the process of a BigPub. Markoff, and the team behind him, are very powerful. They entered my space and are immediately a player, and can cast us in any light they want. That's their right and their power as a communicator. Stuff like that happens all the time on the Web. You can't stop it, nor should anyone want to. "/>
				<outline text="But does that mean I should stop writing, or analyze every sentence and paragraph I write, making sure they could not be strung together to make me say something I don't believe? No of course not, there's no way to do that. I write in a fast-moving medium, things change quickly and quotes that were relevant a couple of weeks ago are only interesting, now, as history."/>
				<outline text="However, I have the power to cast my own work to reflect my intent. That's what I'm doing here. My fallback re Microsoft, if SOAP interop should fail, is to use XML-RPC. My fallback with the NY Times, when interop fails there, is to write a DaveNet piece. It's the same idea. Literature and technology come together. This is the &quot;convergence&quot; we were talking about 10 years ago in the same hushed tones as we talked about P2P last summer and fall."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The amazing story of SOAP and Microsoft">
				<outline text="The more interesting story, one that the Times missed, is the power of the new medium to shape technology. "/>
				<outline text="Both XML-RPC and now SOAP are creatures of the Internet. If we can get Microsoft to play in the open, in public, on the record and for attribution, their BigCo advantage becomes less important, we work together engineer-to-engineer, and the LittleCo's have some important advantages of our own. We have less to lose, fewer products to protect, fewer bosses to please, a much lighter communication firewall. "/>
				<outline text="We can move forward more easily and bring the BigCo's along. I can take heat they can't afford to take, and they can provide air cover and market-building that are outside my power. They can bring in other BigCo's to work with us. If we can accept each other, there's no reason for anyone to lose. I really mean that and think I can prove it. Call me Don Quixote if you want, but this is not a small point to me. ;-&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Customers who want to know how it came together can read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/messages&quot;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;. Same with reporters. I'd argue that the only customers worth having are ones who bother to get informed and act on the information. Maybe this is a reason I will always be a LittleCo. So be it. I think ultimately the quality of reporting will be judged the same way. We're using a revolutionary medium to do our work. That feathers get ruffled is no surprise. Those are &quot;old bits,&quot; stories well-told, every nuance and sublety has been exhausted. "/>
				<outline text="The real surprise is when we push aside hurt feelings and work together anyway. That's the amazing story of SOAP and Microsoft. There have been a dozen junctures when any other BigCo would have blown us off. Yesterday some friends thought we had finally reached that point after the Markoff piece ran. But it didn't happen. There's something puzzlingly different about the Microsoft of 2001, the bluster is still there, for sure, and the corner-cuts still happen. So what. Every BigCo does that. What's different is that Microsoft keeps coming back, when it would be so easy to shut it down. Why do they do that? I don't know the answer but there's more to the story than an irascible gadfly tilting at windmills."/>
				<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;lastParagraph&quot;&gt;In all the emails and talks with Microsoft people yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I said that I feel that the best way to get the press to write the story we want is to go the next step and make sure SOAP is a free market. Then, when that's happened, we'll have a legitimate gripe with publications that spin it another way. We're not fully there yet, so we don't have much cause to complain. Let's dig in, and make it happen, for real."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/17/01; 7:33:33 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning sports fans!">
				<outline text="In 1995 I said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/02/18/billionsofwebsites&quot;&gt;billions of websites&lt;/a&gt; would exist, that a barrier to entry was being eased, that soon everyone who could write would be publishing. Six years later the story is becoming mainstream. Ever more courageous articles appear about weblogs. This week Brill's Content suggests that in the vacuum created by the vanishing dotcoms, the Web is getting even more interesting, thanks to amateur writers, the people who do weblogs. It's true, but it was happening all through the dotcom craze, and it goes back even further. "/>
				<outline text="Writers flow their ideas and opinion to people who only know the writer by name, not by brand. Doc Searls says markets are conversations. The Web is a conversation too. Some people say, still, that the Web will coalesce to a few big brands. Hah. The Web is at the intersection of publishing and the telephone. How many brands of phone conversation are there? Can you call Sandy to talk with Allison?"/>
				<outline text="Writers, pause and think what your purpose is. Sure, you have to earn a living, but does it disgust you to write over-simplified articles that tell a partial truth, or even worse, lie, because your editor and publisher won't buy anything with more depth. Does it frustrate you that readers know you're lying, and seek new ideas from their peers. Ask yourself if you've ever compromised the truth because of the economics or inefficiencies of the process you're part of."/>
				<outline text="What if you're a &lt;a href=&quot;http://glennf.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;freelancer&lt;/a&gt;, you sold a piece on wireless computing, and that's it, but what are you supposed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://80211b.weblogger.com/&quot;&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; with the knowledge you've accumulated as the market you wrote about is developing? Or flipped around, what if you're an engineer and the press is covering your category without any depth, do you just sit by and watch the opportunity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=dissipate&quot;&gt;dissipate&lt;/a&gt;? What if you're a human resources manager in a large corporation, and want to publish a column for your constituents, but the internal development people are always too busy to work on your project?"/>
				<outline text="In all these cases you can take the power into your own hands, start writing for the the Web, and see what comes back to you. These days a column on the Web can get more readership than one in print. Once you've had a taste for this style of writing, if writing is what you do, you'll never want to go back."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Web is a Writing Environment">
				<outline text="The Web is a fantastic writing environment. For sure, it's other things too. It's a shopping mall, a place to get music, someday we'll all be watching movies and TV through Internet-connected devices. To predict otherwise would be to ignore the lessons of history. Our interest in technology is in hiatus while we digest the last flurry of activity, but it will boom again, I'm sure of it."/>
				<outline text="In the meantime, the one revolution that the Internet has totally delivered is a fundamental change in the way written information and ideas flow. As people get more comfortable with networking technology, and as engineers learn how to do easier user interfaces, there will be more people writing on the Web. "/>
				<outline text="Just as typewriters fell by the wayside as word processors and inexpensive printers came online, the big brand names of journalism are relatively slow and dilutive, and don't deliver enough flow. Amazingly the print publishers are pulling back from the Web, as if to say &quot;Whew glad that's over.&quot; Fundamental mistake. When their point of view is no longer on the Web, there will be no more barrier to entry. What follows? Explosive deconstruction of the brand names of journalism."/>
				<outline text="What's said outside the barriers is already more interesting. Eventually we will shed our need for approval from the brand names of journalism. Today they look for teddy bears and warm-fuzzies, the cute stories that mask the real one -- writers who work for others have less &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=integrity&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; to offer than those who do it for love."/>

			<outline text="Disclaimer">
				<outline text="First, a disclaimer. I was a math major in college. I didn't study practical mathematics, I studied a branch of topology called graph theory. At the time it was considered pretty esoteric stuff, but I loved it because it stretched my mind in ways that I liked. "/>
				<outline text="To me the meaning of a word is itself interesting. And the relationship between words is even more interesting. I'm also a humanist. The software I make, although some people feel it is not easy to use, is honed to be so, because I'm interested in the human mind. These disclaimers are part of integrity, but have little to do with honesty. Permit me to explain with an example."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Joe the car salesman">
				<outline text="Pick a human endeavor that's famous for lack of honesty. Car salesman comes to mind. (With apologies to honest car salesmen.) "/>
				<outline text="Suppose Joe is a car salesman. The most slimey of them all, he misleads and lies all the time. Every statement he makes has to be analyzed in utmost detail to figure out what he really means. It's exhausting. "/>
				<outline text="Now suppose Joe starts writing a column on the Web or in his local newspaper. Right up front it says Joe is a car salesman at Utopia Motors. He proceeds to lie all over the place and mislead and talks about how much better his products are than his main competitor, Slidell Cars and Trucks. "/>
				<outline text="Is Joe honest? Of course not (by definition). Does he have integrity? Yes, he has &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; integrity because he is being true to what he said he is. If he had not told you he was a car salesman and had written his story as if he were a mere car user, then he would have very little integrity, and the publication he wrote for would have a problem."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Integrity and honesty">
				<outline text="This is going on in the real world all the time. I write a column called DaveNet. Does it have integrity? It's a good question, and I'm not sure of the answer. I try to disclose my interests, maybe I don't succeed in doing that, or perhaps a new reader comes along and doesn't understand that I'm often writing about software I create. I try to not push my software too much through DaveNet. On the other hand Scripting News is an hour-to-hour log of my work. Inevitably it does push what I do because that's what it's about. But I don't tell all there. So perhaps that's an integrity problem. "/>
				<outline text="In other words it's an integrity problem only to the extent that I fail to inform the reader of an interest that colors what I write. If I say Anne's software sucks without saying I have software that competes with Anne's then I am suffering from a lack of integrity. To say that I &quot;blatantly promote&quot; my own software is, emphatically, not an integrity challenge. The blatant part of it is my defense. If I did it in an unobvious way, then my integrity is definitely on the table."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Reuters and Dan Bricklin">
				<outline text="Consider another example. On Monday Reuters ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010416/n16497311_2.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; with extensive quotes from Dan Bricklin, including one that I took issue with about the quality of work of people who write weblogs. It was right on topic, and I nailed Dan, perhaps unfairly."/>
				<outline text="Dan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricklin.com/log/pulitzerblogs.htm&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that he was misquoted. Being a software developer myself, as Dan is, I tend to believe him. I've been misquoted myself. I'm suspicious when the misquote tends to favor the person writing the story. In the Reuters example, the story was carefully staged (so it seemed to me) to make it clear that what the amateurs were doing was in no way a threat to pros. Of course the piece was written by a professional journalist. To me, with my own unique perspective, it seemed to be an ad for the pros at the expense of the amateurs."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A challenging time for the pros">
				<outline text="One of the things I've learned in the last few days is that many professional writers don't want to examine their own integrity. This in itself is an integrity problem. "/>
				<outline text="The challenge for professional journalists is this -- can they write a story that could undermine their own livelihood? I have doubts about this. But what if a change, even a revolution, is in process that changes the means by which people get fact and opinion? Can we depend on the BigPub's to carry that story fairly without coloring it, or are disclaimers required, like the one that our hypothetical car salesman provided, so we can understand the context of the writing?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="More disclaimers">
				<outline text="Now it's only fair to say that I make software that makes it easy for people to write for the Web without working for a professional publication. If you poke around my site you'll find it, easily. "/>
				<outline text="I have an interest in the path being clear for amateur writers to contribute to the flow of news and information, perhaps even overtake the professionals. I've been pretty clear about this, I hope, since the inception of DaveNet, in 1994."/>
				<outline text="I also have an interest in the pros adopting the techniques of the amateurs, doing less shaping, coloring and casting of news, and more straight delivery. As in my work with the BigCo's on interop, I'd like to see a melding of technique. I think the pros can teach the amateurs, and vice versa, just as the LittleCo's can do things that the Big Ones can't. Win-wins, even partnerships, are possible. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Amateur writers">
				<outline text="A user of a car has little to disclaim other than he or she is a user. Not much to say there, because the prose explains itself. This is the highest integrity writing, even though it may not be the most insightful or truthful. That's why the sentence at the end of my last &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/04/17/theWebIsAWritingEnvironment&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; is almost a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=tautology&quot;&gt;tautology&lt;/a&gt;, fully self-evident. But my last piece pushed a lot of buttons. That in itself is interesting."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="Go where it's hot">
				<outline text="In a long life you will meet a lot of people, and each one can teach you something. Those who are willing to help probe your fears can be the most valuable friends, as long as it's done at a respectful distance, with humor and love. "/>
				<outline text="A long time ago I had a really smart friend. She pressed all my buttons, but I was quite attracted to her anyway. When she discovered that something scared me, she'd say &quot;Then that's what we'll do!&quot; "/>
				<outline text="It's a good way to live, I've found out. If you hate rollercoasters ride one. If you love TV, stop watching. If you don't like cheese eat some, appeciate its fine qualities, but pay more attention to what you don't like about it, because in that is a fear that you might be able to shed. "/>
				<outline text="A life lead with less fear is a more relaxed and enjoyable life, imho."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A new artform">
				<outline text="Swinging back to the experience with Dan Bricklin's quote in Reuters about the quality of writing among amateurs, it gets quite recursive. Both Bricklin and Blogger-author Evan Williams wrote their own accounts of the deal on the Web, because they were concerned that the press would mangle the story. "/>
				<outline text="What's wrong with this picture? The subjects of the press are now doing their own press. Does this strike you, as it does me, as a loop? Why is it necessary? Haven't we been here before? Isn't this what happened with mainframes when personal computers came along? How secure were the mainframe people when faced with a horde of Apple developers with nothing to lose. They were dismissive, for sure, I was there (so was Bricklin) but it didn't matter. The users could do it for themselves. And then that's what happened."/>
				<outline text="So here's an interesting milestone. Usually you get boring lying puffy press releases from the principals of a story. In the Blogger-Trellix deal, we got &lt;i&gt;first-hand personal essays&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evhead.com/longer/trellix_essays.asp&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://danbricklin.com/log/blogger.htm&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who made the deal.

			<outline text="Has Microsoft changed?">
				<outline text="Good morning amateur journalism fans."/>
				<outline text="I was interviewed by a BigPub yesterday. The subject was Microsoft. Have they changed or not? My point of view is the world has changed, Microsoft is not the agent of change, and in some ways they're embracing the change (good) and in other ways are resisting it (not good). Networking was immature and confusing before the Web happened. Now that the Web is mainstream and well-understood, the natural next step is to distribute and decentralize the technology. To some extent Microsoft understands the sea-change and in some ways does not acknowledge the change, imho. "/>
				<outline text="But will Microsoft really be open with SOAP? The journalist I was talking with is a smart guy so I let him in on a subtle but poignant bit I had been saving for just such an occasion. Yes, Microsoft will be truly open with SOAP, for good reason, because it will help developers migrate out of Java and into Microsoft's new tools and runtime. They're playing catch-up here, as with the browser in the mid-90s, Java is a juggernaut, it's huge. Microsoft wants some of the Java developers to switch to Dot-Net. Hey, truth be told Microsoft probably wants &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the Java developers to switch."/>
				<outline text="Now, of course, I don't want to see that ever happen. Ever. Emphasize that. My vision for SOAP, as with XML-RPC, is that it turns the Internet into a World Wide Scripting Environment, much as the Web turned the Internet into a World Wide Writing Environment. This means lots of choice, and never any lock-in. "/>
				<outline text="The time to ask the question about Microsoft truly being open isn't now, when they have everything to gain from open-ness, but when they achieve dominance in the market. At that point, without government intervention, or self-imposed restraint, you can be sure it's going to close up. "/>
				<outline text="So let's make sure Microsoft does not achieve market dominance, and let's do it in a positive way, by celebrating the diversity that the Internet creates."/>
				<outline text="http://www.soapware.org/directory/4/implementations"/>
				<outline text="http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/implementations"/>
				<outline text="BTW, as of today there are 50 SOAP 1.1 implementations, and 33 XML-RPC implementations. We've started new interop work for XML-RPC. SOAP is moving along well, and the BigCo's are helping. Our focus is in three directions: interop, applications and business development. "/>

			<outline text="First-hand accounts">
				<outline text="A reader points out that I've been doing first-hand personal accounts longer than anyone else. It may be true, but never, until the Times piece, to balance press coverage, and generally as a solo act. Imagine if Bill Gates had written an essay to go along with one I wrote about SOAP. That would have been interesting. Two sides of the same story from different points of view, without intermediaries."/>
				<outline text="For some reason I'm still figuring out, that I write first-hand accounts means UserLand rarely gets press coverage for new stuff we're doing. Talking with a reporter last week I asked why. He said reporters don't like to do stories that have already been written. At some point that I'm not aware of they accepted me as One Of Them, so if it appeared on Scripting News or in DaveNet, the story had already been done, and they didn't want to do it. Huh? Wrong!"/>

			<outline text="Yellow light of caution">
				<outline text="Dan Gillmor, columnist for the San Jose Mercury News, and pioneering weblogger, is tuning into the amateur writing thread. Yesterday he linked to an excellent Bill Moyer speech on journalism and democracy. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.thenation.com/docPrint.mhtml?i=20010507&amp;s=moyers "/>
				<outline text="Moyers says: &quot;Before Mutual of America I had lost at least three corporate underwriters, who were happy as long as we didn't make anyone else unhappy. Losing your underwriting will keep the yellow light of caution flickering in a journalist's unconscious.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Amateur at Wired">
				<outline text="There is a big difference between what I do and what the BigPubs do. I'm an amateur. I make software. I write because I love to write, and because I want to make sure that my side gets out without interference. That's why, once the editorial weenies swooped in at Wired and started inverting my ideas, I was out of there like a puff of smoke in a Roadrunner cartoon."/>
				<outline text="But I loved writing at Wired. For a brief period I was a pro. The respect was intoxicating. One company took my words of praise and pasted them all over their tradeshow booth. &quot;Dave Winer, HotWired&quot; it said in 80K point. It felt great. "/>
				<outline text="I also encountered the corporate sponsorship thing. At a party, editor-publisher Louis Rosetto introduced me to one of Wired's biggest advertisers, an American vice-president of a Japanese company, Fujitsu, Toshiba, or something like that. I listened to his pitch for a minute, and interrupted with a question. &quot;Don't you make a clone?&quot; I asked. He gulped. I saw a light go on. He looked at Louis, and Louis at me. They walked away. I felt owned."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="BigPubs could still win">
				<outline text="To Dan, who is concerned about the business models for the BigPubs, they could ace us any day they want to change. Get rid of the nudges and winks, and really set us free. Perform an editorial function, add resources and distribution, even branding, but let the voices come through clearly. I'd say we're 25 percent of the way through a route-around. Embrace the change asap, find the integrity in business and work with it. The Internet makes it possible, even necessary, to compete with integrity. That's the sea change. Adapt, as we all must."/>
				<outline text="BTW, an aside to Salon, this is the void you avoided. Salon is floundering, imho, because they failed to embrace the amateur journalism that their medium, the Web, enables. They could still switch gears and tap into the growth of the Web, it's probably not too late, but soon, I fear, it will be."/>

			<outline text="Got 15 minutes?">
				<outline text="If you have 15 minutes this morning, please read these two accounts of the same story."/>
				<outline text="First, here's a Boston Globe article describing a dispute between an enterpreneur and the venture capitalists he made a deal with."/>
				<outline text="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/114/business/Web_entrepreneur_financiers_battle+.shtml"/>
				<outline text="It's a well-written, balanced piece, covering both sides of a controversy, but it's short on detail, and in achieving its balance and brevity, omits the passion and personality. It ends with a judgment that you might believe if you skip the next step, but please don't, you'll miss the point."/>
				<outline text="Now read the riveting first-hand personal account of the entrepreneur, Philip Greenspun."/>
				<outline text="http://philip.greenspun.com/arsdigita/litigation-story"/>
				<outline text="I can tell from reading this piece that Greenspun gets the software business. Yeah I think I'd like to do a programming retreat at the Cape Cod beach house he describes in the piece. I had heard about it before from the VC side, and it sounded like a foolish extravagance. When Greenspun describes it, however, it sounds like a perk to balance the 80-hour weeks that dedicated software engineers put in to get the momentum needed to make competitive products. "/>
				<outline text="I also recognize the foibles of the venture capital industry in Greenspun's story. They tend to cut corners, make huge decisions without enough information, and care little about the values of the company, its relations with customers or the future of its products. You might say it's crass capitalism, but I think of it as reckless management. He describes his VCs as a &quot;group of nursery school children who've stolen a Boeing 747 and are now flipping all the switches trying to get it to take off.&quot; Yeah, I think I've seen VCs try to do that. (Not any who read this column of course.)"/>
				<outline text="Now I understand that I've just heard one side of the story, and I admit to a bias, I tend to see things from the entrepreneur's point of view. I would love to read a similar account from the venture capitalists. If they post their side of the story, I promise to run it through this column. "/>
				<outline text="To encourage them, know that I've met Greenspun, we sparred in public on the keynote stage of Seybold in Boston last February. I enjoyed it because I like being challenged by smart people, it raises my senses and intellect, and I promise you, no one in the room fell asleep. I know he can be demanding, but business isn't about hurt feelings or lost prestige, it's about success and profits and if you're competitive, as all good business people are, it's about winning. These are my values, and I think many VCs share those values. (I hope so.)"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, I think we're really onto something here. The people are doing their own press, and doing it damned well. Thanks to Philip Greenspun for showing us how it's done, and thanks for the courage to state your case so clearly. Amateur journalism at its best."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/30/01; 10:19:03 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Ben Slivka">
				<outline text="This is a brief piece to introduce a term that I first heard a few weeks ago talking with an ex-Microsoft engineer, Ben Slivka. I got to know Ben in the mid-90s when he was the lead on Microsoft's earliest versions of Internet Explorer and Java. These projects were pure strategy, neither generated revenue, but they gave Microsoft a seat at the table in the evolution of the Web."/>
				<outline text="Ben left Microsoft in 1999, went to Amazon, and then went home to spend time with his family and enjoy life. That's why he had time to talk with me on the phone to explain how strategy at Microsoft worked when he was there, and perhaps still does."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is a strategy tax?">
				<outline text="Ben explained that sometimes products developed inside a company such as Microsoft have to accept constraints that go against competitiveness, or might displease users, in order to further the cause of another product. I recognized the concept but had never heard the term. "/>
				<outline text="An example. Consider a company that develops both a Web browser and a word processor. The product team for the browser might get lots of input from users saying &quot;We'd like a better editor in the browser.&quot; It would be natural to give the users what they want. So they put the feature in their project plan, but when it comes up for review, the CEO shoots them down. &quot;They should use the word processor,&quot; he says. "/>
				<outline text="Another example. An electronics company makes a portable music player, and also owns a recording studio. The team working on the music player knows that there's a big market for players that work with a format that's popular with computer users, but lacks sophisticated copy protection. They project huge sales. But when the product comes up for review, the CEO shoots them down. &quot;We'll lose sales of our music,&quot; he says."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="My experience">
				<outline text="In the 1980s I was a member of the &quot;have the courage to compete with yourself&quot; school. This meant that I disavowed strategy taxes altogether. It got me in trouble, I almost lost my company this way."/>
				<outline text="In 1984 we had a steady provider, ThinkTank, it was selling two to three thousand copies a month, providing enough revenue for a staff of about 25 people. In 1985, a new kind of program became the rage, exemplified by Borland's Sidekick, which had the unique ability, for the day, of staying in memory while you used other software. Our users said &quot;That's for us!&quot; and we said &quot;Stay tuned.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="We developed a beautiful little program, that was very popular for a few months, but then quickly tailed off. We thought ThinkTank would cease to exist after we shipped the new product (the strategy tax thinking, in reverse), but quite the contrary, ThinkTank kept selling at the same two to three thousand units a month level. It never skipped a beat."/>
				<outline text="Not content to leave a good thing alone, we then shipped another product, which did kill ThinkTank, finally, but luckily for us sold even more units at a higher price, so the story had a happy ending. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Two schools of thought">
				<outline text="First, every company has strategy taxes. There's no way to eliminate them if you serve more than one constituency. You have to trade the interests off against each other, otherwise your products become mush, they mean nothing to anyone. But do you worry about another vendor giving your customers what they want? If so, you're probably wise to overlook the problems it might create. "/>
				<outline text="Viewed another way, it seems a company can sell so much product in a month. It hardly matters what the product is, things just seem to balance out. If that's true, what guiding principle should strategists follow? In my opinion, try to do the best thing for the most users, but also keep the lines between the products clear. This builds goodwill and keeps it simple for the product teams, and that often leads to happier users. Let the teams compete with each other, let the market shift, and build momentum that's sustainable."/>

			<outline text="Earlier this evening">
				<outline text="On April 9, John Markoff &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/09/technology/09HAIL.html&quot;&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; the work we've been doing in SOAP 1.1 interop, in the NY Times. There were bumps in the process, it got dramatic at times, Microsoft used their power, and I balanced it with some of my own, and then Markoff used some of his. Earlier this evening I sent an email to update him on where we're at. It occurred to me that I should update DaveNet readers as well. Here's a lightly edited copy of the email."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Email to Markoff">
				<outline text="A couple of things."/>
				<outline text="1. We seem to have reached a plateau in SOAP 1.1 interop. This means that, while it's not possible to throw any random message at any server have it do something interesting with it, there is a way to use SOAP 1.1 to talk between all the implementations that participated in the process. (The same can be said of HTTP, I can't send any request to www.nytimes.com and have it necessarily return anything meaningful.)"/>
				<outline text="2. Microsoft shipped their SOAP toolkit last week to Visual Studio developers that is the result of their interop work. We saw this as a signal to get a release of Radio and Frontier together with our result, and apparently the Apache Group (which includes IBM) is doing the same. "/>
				<outline text="There you have it. Gorillas and small jungle animals participating to make love not war. Some growling and teeth-baring for sure, but we're all still here chuggin away. Well worth the time we put into it. My next priorities are more interop work, apps, and business development. "/>
				<outline text="I had another thought for you not related to this milestone. During the week you were preparing your story you asked if I still believed that SOAP would be a level playing field. I expressed some doubt, but I may not, at the time have understood where the question was coming from. I don't think it's up to Microsoft to determine if SOAP is a level playing field. I think they have the power to kill SOAP, but given the group of people involved in SOAP interop, I don't think any of them will go along with a half-assed idea of interop. It may be a unique time in the software industry."/>
				<outline text="An analogy. I've always admired the Cubs' fans even though I'm a lifetime Mets fan. The fans have philosophies, even if the players and management don't. The Cubs fans sitting in the outfield bleachers have a tradition of throwing the ball back on the field when an opposing team hits a home run as if to say &quot;We can't be bothered with this right now, let us know when you have something important to say.&quot; A SOAP captured by Microsoft would be denounced in an instant, in a similar way."/>
				<outline text="Dave"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;ps&quot;&gt;PS&lt;/a&gt;: We're putting together a press release and quote sheet for this milestone, if you have a comment you'd like to share, just respond to this email. Please include your title and affiliation. Thanks!"/>

				<outline text="Good morning sports fans, it's a bright new day, I'm feeling rather clean because yesterday I had a total hard disk crash. I lost every bit of information on my main computer. And of course my backups were inadequate, I lost some work, and learned once again that Murphy is my best friend and colleague. He's with me where ever I go. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Could HailStorm help?">
				<outline text="I wrote yesterday on Scripting News: &quot;As I put back together all my favorites and settings for the 18th time in the last three years, maybe now the value of HailStorm or something like it is sinking in. Suppose all that information was up in the cloud. So my hard disk crashes. Not a problem. Every time my computer boots it checks in with the cloud and gets all that junk.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Shortly after posting this I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/past/2001_05_01_past.php#3484766&quot;&gt;Brad Choate&lt;/a&gt;, who asks a question I heard a lot in the intial discussion of HailStorm. Here's an excerpt from his email."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Brad Choate">
				<outline text="I'm a big Microsoft consumer just like most people, but frankly Hailstorm scares me a little.  OK, a lot. I remember when I first saw &quot;The Net&quot; -- the concept back then of someone erasing or hijacking the identity of someone else seemed ludicrous. But with a technology like Hailstorm, where user information is so centralized, it makes it much easier to be a reality.  "/>
				<outline text="I'm not suggesting that Microsoft themselves would be capable of abusing their own system, but they don't have the best track record when it comes to security issues.  It's one thing for a standalone commerce site to be compromised, yielding thousands of credit card numbers.  It's another thing altogether if someone breaks Hailstorm and grabs hundreds of thousands or millions of credit card numbers, addresses, and other personal information that Hailstorm will be collecting from every user.  Frightening."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Hmmm">
				<outline text="I forwarded Brad's email to Charles Fitzgerald, a Microsoft marketing director. "/>
				<outline text="I said: &quot;You must be hearing a lot of this.. What do you say to them?&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Here's what Charles said."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Charles Fitzgerald">
				<outline text="1. Our business success is predicated on giving you control over your data. Your stuff is your stuff - we're simply providing a system by which you manage, protect and securely share your data. If we fail to do this, we fail as a business. We don't like to do that. Aligning business model with customer proposition is a very powerful incentive to do the right thing."/>
				<outline text="2. Microsoft won't sell, mine, target or publish your data. Nor is there any advertising around HailStorm so we avoid any conflicts associated with ads. Contrast that to most Web sites or AOL which is all about monetizing your eyeballs and force feeding you a diet of pop-up banner ads, People magazine and the Cartoon Network."/>
				<outline text="3. The security system is a key part of protecting privacy of data. We think we have a very good and compartmentalized one that mortals can actually use (the weakest link in any security system is humans). And while theoretical browser holes and such make the headlines, the reality is we know how to run secure systems. We have some minor nits in the past (and hopefully we have learned from them), but the reality is we are probably the most attacked set of sites on the Internet. We get attacked tens of thousands of times a month - no better proof."/>
				<outline text="4. People have a hard time understanding just how terrible the privacy situation is today."/>

			<outline text="Something new?">
				<outline text="For the last few months I've been trying to wrap my mind around Apple's new operating system, which is both Macintosh and Unix at the same time. The Mac OS X users I email with seem a bit like fish out of water, gasping for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=sustenance&quot;&gt;sustenance&lt;/a&gt;, and finding that the air is breathable, even if it is a strange experience."/>
				<outline text="To me, as a software developer, it's intriguing that it runs both Mac and Unix software. The juice is at the intersection between the two. Imagine being able to shoot commands at Quark XPress from a Perl script running behind Apache. As Mac apps get &quot;carbonized&quot; to run on Unix side, just this kind of connection should be commonplace. What a rush of power. A new scripting culture to explore."/>
				<outline text="It gets even worse. SOAP and XML-RPC are coming to the Macintosh, from several sources, and because of the interop work we've been doing with other developers, it stands a pretty good chance of working with all other popular OSes. Imagine what this means for the education and publishing worlds where Macs are quite popular; and for the business world where publishing and education are things they want to plug into their applications."/>
				<outline text="So far the attention has been on the user experience of Mac OS X. But look deeper, there's a difference in the developer culture of the platform. It's something new."/>

			<outline text="Shock">
				<outline text="Like many, I was shocked on Saturday morning to find out that science fiction author Douglas Adams had died on Friday at age 49. Like many people of our generation I read his books and talked about them endlessly with friends, quoting them, and to some extent I've modeled my writing style after his. "/>
				<outline text="I had two memorable conversations with Adams, one in public and one on the telephone. He had a nice flamboyance, but he was not arrogant man, and he loved the Macintosh, and software, and was serious about it, even though he was such a funny author; and it seems unfair to us to lose him at such a young age, and of course unfair to him that his time was so short."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Taking it in">
				<outline text="Now I suppose it's only natural to be totally selfish about this. I'm 46, he was just three years older. On the Web I saw a bunch of other people my age draw the same conclusion -- &quot;If it can happen to him, maybe it'll happen to me?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Geez, to think that I might only have three years left to live. What torture. That feeling has virtually paralyzed me since I heard of his death. What if my heart is getting ready to explode? What if that pimple is really cancer? My aunt died at 49. Joey Ramone died a few weeks ago, at 49. "/>
				<outline text="49. Three years away."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Time is what you make it">
				<outline text="Then on a walk today, the first I've taken since Adams' death, I had a realization. "/>
				<outline text="What matters is not how much time you have left, we're all on a reprieve, no matter how old or young we are, death will come for all of us, and it will probably come too soon. No, it doesn't matter how much time you have, what matters is how you use the time you have."/>
				<outline text="So I feel a sense of urgency to complete things, then let the world take care of them, and itself, and I'll take care of the time I have left, whether it be 3 days, 3 months, or 3 years; or Murphy-willing, more than that."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A quote">
				<outline text="From The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe."/>
				<outline text="&quot;You know, it's at times like this when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Why, what did she tell you?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;I don't know, I didn't listen!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="So congratulations to Adams, where ever he is, on an inspiring life of creativity, humor and fun. He taught us that the universe doesn't have to be such a serious place"/>

				<outline text="It appears I've got a new business -- writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=foreword&quot;&gt;forewords&lt;/a&gt; to books I believe in."/>
				<outline text="It doesn't pay very well, but it's gratifying work.

It will be released from Apress later this month. Highly recommended."/>
				<outline text="In April, technical book publisher O'Reilly Associates asked me to write the foreword for their upcoming book on XML-RPC, a protocol I've been working on and promoting since 1998. Here is a copy of the foreword lightly edited for email distribution. There's a link to the O'Reilly catalog at the end of the piece where you can order a copy of the book. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="History of XML-RPC">
				<outline text="My name is Dave Winer. I wear a lot of hats. I'm the CEO of a company, a programmer, a columnist, weblogger, and a developer of things that turn into standards. The last role was the biggest surprise. I've been developing software since the late 1970s, and all the time I wanted most to create a standard, to develop something that's so compelling and simple that its goodness propels it to success. I'd say now, with XML-RPC becoming such a widely adopted protocol, that it's happened. It's a strange feeling, for sure. Here's how it started."/>
				<outline text="In 1998, my company, UserLand Software, had just finished porting Frontier from Macintosh to Windows. Our software made extensive use of networking, so we had a problem -- with two versions of the software, how would they communicate? We could no longer use the networking software of one platform, Apple Events on the Mac, or DCOM on Windows. So we decided to use two standards of the Internet, XML and HTTP, to form the communication protocol for our software. By &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/01/14/xmlRpc&quot;&gt;January 1998&lt;/a&gt; we had a deployed protocol for Frontier-to-Frontier communication simply called RPC, and it worked pretty well."/>
				<outline text="As I often do, I wrote a public &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; about this and offered to work with others. Usually I make those offers and no one responds. This time, I got a call from Bob Atkinson, who I knew from work we did with Microsoft on COM in the early 90s, and he asked if we would like work with them on XML-over-HTTP. I remembered that it had been a lot of fun working with Bob in the past, so without hesitation, I said yes."/>
				<outline text="I flew up to Redmond, met with Bob and met Mohsen Al-Ghosein and Don Box for the first time. We sat in a conference room, I had a projected laptop. I opened Notepad with an example call from our earlier protocol. As people expressed their ideas I changed the example. It was one of the most productive brainstorming sessions of my career."/>
				<outline text="When I got back to California, we set up a website and a private mail list, and got busy writing clients and servers. That's when betty.userland.com came into existence (it's mentioned in the chapters of this book). Mohsen wrote JavaScript code to call my server. We talked about it on the mail list. One day Mohsen called and described a much more powerful serialization format. Until then we had only been passing scalars, but with Mohsen's idea we could move much more complicated structures. We upgraded our implementations and a few hours later we were talking structs and arrays."/>
				<outline text="A few weeks into the process I wanted to release the software to our users. It was already much more powerful than what we were shipping. Wire protocols are a delicate area, and serious breakage would surely happen if we waited much longer. So we forked a release, called it XML-RPC, and continued working with Microsoft on what would become SOAP 1.1. "/>
				<outline text="But that's another story and another O'Reilly book. ;-&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is XML-RPC?">
				<outline text="As Edd and Simon explain so well, XML-RPC is XML over HTTP, and a great way to develop Web Services. But there's actually more going on here, there's a philosophy to XML-RPC that's different from other software projects. The philosophy is choice, and from choice comes power, and, interestingly, a disclaimer of power."/>
				<outline text="In the past, your choice of development environment limited your power as a developer. If you chose to do Java development, that meant, for the most, that your code could only communicate with other Java programs. Same was true of Microsoft and, in practical terms, many open source scripting environments. "/>
				<outline text="However, when you build applications with XML-RPC as the connecting glue, all of a sudden you're not locked in. If you want to switch from Java to Python, for example, you can do it gradually, one component at a time. This kind of fluidity allows developers more choices, and relieves platform developers of the responsibility of being all things to all people. By supporting XML-RPC the platform is offering you a way out if you don't like the way they're going. Choice here is power for developers. We've learned the lessons from lock-in, XML-RPC takes it the next step, where it's supported you are guaranteed choice."/>
				<outline text="Having XML-RPC in place also means that new environments can come along, and even if they don't wipe out all previous environments (they never do of course) they can still find a user base that appreciates their qualities, and their work can interoperate with the larger environment."/>
				<outline text="Viewed another way, XML-RPC turns the Internet itself into a scripting environment, much as Visual Basic turned Windows into a scripting environment, or AppleScript turned the Macintosh OS into one. It makes our worlds come together, makes the bigger world smaller and more approachable. And it's inclusive, no one need be left out of the XML-RPC revolution. "/>
				<outline text="And you can pick it up by a different thread and it's one of the most ambitious and successful open source projects in history. Most of the XML-RPC implementations are open source. Leaders of the open source world from Eric S. Raymond to Tim O'Reilly are big fans of XML-RPC. The Slashdot guys love it. Why? Because it's simple, low-tech, and it gives developers freedom to choose their development environment. "/>
				<outline text="The joy of XML-RPC, for the programmer and designer is that we can learn how other people do what we do. I know almost nothing about the non-UserLand implementations, yet my software is part of the network defined by all the languages that support XML-RPC. It's like visiting a foreign country where they don't speak your language. They still eat and sleep and do all the other things we all do, but they do it differently. It's a passport that takes you anywhere you want to go."/>
				<outline text="So in my humble opinion, XML-RPC the ultimate leveler. It teaches us about each other, it's what we have in common. Perl, Python, Tcl, C++, Java, Microsoft, Sun, O'Reilly, sole proprietors, LittleCo's and BigCo's, open source teams, consultants and contractors, everyone can be on the bus, everyone can contribute to the environment and benefit from it. Sure, it's also XML-over-HTTP; but it's also a ticket to freedom and power for all developers."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What's next?">
				<outline text="Here's a list of issues that are on my mind re XML-RPC in April 2001."/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Apps&lt;/b&gt;. As we continue to work on interop, we're also creating public services in XML-RPC. For example our Manila content management system has a full XML-RPC interface, as does xmlStorageSystem, and mailToTheFuture. This means that every Manila site is a server that you can run XML-RPC scripts against. There are so many cool things we can do here. The apps are linked into the Services section of the XML-RPC directory. The list is relatively short now, one of our goals is to make the list &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; big."/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Tools&lt;/b&gt;. One of the most exciting possibilities of XML-RPC is that writing and illustration tools can seamlessly connect to servers, turning the Web into a fantastic easy creative environment, open to all. "/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Deployment&lt;/b&gt;. I'd like to see scripting environments bake XML-RPC into their releases. Networking is an important function for all developers, UserLand has included full XML-RPC support in all of our products, and encourage others to do so too."/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Community&lt;/b&gt;. Please join the XML-RPC community. We have an active mail list and website, all the resources are pointed to from http://www.xmlrpc.com/. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Thanks">
				<outline text="Finally, thanks to O'Reilly for supporting the XML-RPC community with such an excellent book. "/>
				<outline text="And thanks to Edd Dumbill and Simon St Laurent, for studying and understanding and documenting XML-RPC in the depth they have. Such commitment and talent is rare, we're really lucky to have them working to make XML-RPC more broadly accessible to Internet developers."/>
				<outline text="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progxmlrpc/"/>
				<outline text="Now I turn you over to their capable hands. I hope you enjoy XML-RPC and join the community, and let's use XML-RPC to create a fantastic new Internet scripting environment."/>

				<outline text="In 1938, Orson Welles began a radio show with this famous sentence. &quot;We know now that in the early years of the twentieth century this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own.&quot; "/>

				<outline text="The next day the NY Times &lt;a href=&quot;http://members.aol.com/jeff1070/wotw.html&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; &quot;A wave of mass hysteria seized thousands of radio listeners between 8:15 and 9:30 o'clock last night when a broadcast of a dramatization of H. G. Wells's fantasy, 'The War of the Worlds,' led thousands to believe that an interplanetary conflict had started with invading Martians spreading wide death and destruction in New Jersey and New York.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Faking a death online">
				<outline text="A fascinating story, similar to the War of the Worlds panic, though not on the same scale, and probably not playful, unwound on the Web today. A hoax involving hundreds or thousands of members of the weblogging community was uncovered by a reporter named Saundra Mitchell. The hoax is unravelling now in fascinating real time."/>
				<outline text="Here's what &lt;i&gt;appeared&lt;/i&gt; to happen. A 19-year old woman named Kaycee started a weblog to write about her terminal leukemia. On May 16 readers of Kaycee's site learned that she had died two days earlier, from her mother, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanderwoning.com/living/mblog.shtml&quot;&gt;Debbie&lt;/a&gt;, and a friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanderwoning.com/archives/00000162.shtml&quot;&gt;Randall van der Woning&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in Hong Kong."/>
				<outline text="On Thursday and Friday, Ms. Mitchell wrote a fantastic couple of pieces, entitled &quot;Your Guide to Faking a Life and Death Online&quot; and &quot;All Satire Aside,&quot; in which she explained her theory of how the hoax was stitched together, and provided facts to substantiate the theory."/>
				<outline text="http://www.anywherebeyond.com/2001/0501/051701.html"/>
				<outline text="http://www.anywherebeyond.com/2001/0501/051801.html"/>
				<outline text="A chilling quote from her Friday piece. &quot;JournalCon and whatnot are coming up, and a lot of people would likely have wanted to meet her there, considering her tales of recovery. I suspect that the person behind all this suddenly realized just how out of control this had gotten. They certainly couldn't produce a real live girl (no matter how miraculously recovered she allegedly was) and so they killed her.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Then the most interesting thread I've seen in a long time developed on MetaFilter, including posts from van der Woning, and the faked death fully unraveled in the space of a few hours. A post from someone who claimed to be Debbie admitted it was a hoax, followed by a post from van der Woning, forgiving her. It's pretty clear that the story hasn't fully unraveled yet. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/7819"/>
				<outline text="We know that Kaycee wasn't real, but the emotions her reported death exposed were. How many of the players in this story are real? I don't know. I know &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; a real person, and that's about all I know for sure, and sometimes.. ;-&gt;"/>

This means people in Denmark don't like to talk. Later I learned this is true of much of Europe. Does this mean they're not smart? I don't know. How can you tell if they don't talk? But the people putting on the show, Thomas, Nanna and Michael, were, like so many of the people I meet when I travel, off-the-scale smart, enthusiastic and happy to share their point of view.

I was using my new software (codename Smurf Turf) in a new way, the result of joining it with some competent sexy unannounced Microsoft software. I kept thinking about how this was weird, and I'd have some explaining to do, but then think about all the people who would be using my software and that appeared to balance things, but I still felt uncertain. Then I programmed a little music player page, and clicked a button and all of a sudden beautiful music came out of the speakers for everyone to hear and they all started dancing a smart competent dance. "/>
				<outline text="As I turned the knobs on the control panel a smart competent Microsoft person showed up and I said &quot;Hey this is cool, can people record this music?&quot; The Microsoft person rubbed the back of my neck in a respectful and understanding way and said &quot;No&quot; and walked away.

				<outline text="A few weeks ago I was interviewed by JD Lasica, a columnist for the Online Journalism Review, produced by the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. "/>
				<outline text="http://ojr.usc.edu/"/>
				<outline text="Lasica interviewed five professional journalists who also run weblogs: Paul Andrews, Deborah Branscum, Glenn Fleishman, Dan Gillmor and Doc Searls. The only amateur in the group was yours truly."/>
				<outline text="The first &lt;a href=&quot;http://ojr.usc.edu/content/story.cfm?request=585&quot;&gt;installment&lt;/a&gt; appeared last Thursday, the second and final &lt;a href=&quot;http://ojr.usc.edu/content/story.cfm?request=588&quot;&gt;installment&lt;/a&gt; appeared yesterday. As I read it I thought &quot;I want the DaveNet readers to see this.&quot; So here's his second piece, with interviews with Dan, Doc and myself."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Weblogs: A new source of News">
				<outline text="By JD Lasica."/>
				<outline text="Will Weblogs displace established media organizations as a source of news, information and opinion? Not in this lifetime. But they will continue to make inroads as a supplement to traditional news sources. "/>
				<outline text="As Doc Searls, one of the deep thinkers in the blog movement, says: &quot;It's a matter of 'and' logic, not 'or' logic. Weblogs will inform old media. They will increasingly be a source of information that traditional media will rely on.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="The first Weblog has generally been ascribed to Dave Winer (interviewed below) in 1997. Blogs began taking off in 1999 with the launch of sites like Blogger, Weblogger and LiveJournal, which made self-publishing painless for the masses. While tens of thousands of blogs have blossomed, mainstream media have only recently shown a glimmer of interest in the form. "/>
				<outline text="That's hardly surprising. Weblogs are the anti-newspaper in some ways. Where the editorial process can filter out errors and polish a piece of copy to a fine sheen, too often the machinery turns even the best prose limp, lifeless, sterile and homogenized. A huge part of blogs' appeal lies in their unmediated quality. Blogs tend to be impressionistic, telegraphic, raw, honest, individualistic, highly opinionated and passionate, often striking an emotional chord. "/>
				<outline text="Sometimes they veer toward immediacy and conjecture at the expense of accuracy and thoughtful reflection. But the best news blogs offer a personal prism that combines pointers to trusted sources of information with a subjective, passion-based journalism. If nothing else, Weblogs are about personal publishing  people sharing what's in their gut and backing it up with facts or persuasion. "/>
				<outline text="The serendipity factor looms large. Weblog writing may not often sparkle but it often surprises. Blogs unearth the strange, the quirky, the interesting nugget that would have remained hidden. As more people take up Weblogging and more of us come to rely on blogs to help us shape our own personal media universe, media organizations would do well to incorporate them into their Web sites as an important new addition to the journalistic toolkit. "/>
				<outline text="Here's a sampling of a few publications featuring Weblogs: "/>
				<outline text="*  Dan Gillmor of the San Jose Mercury News has been publishing a daily Weblog on the paper's SiliconValley.com site for more than 18 months. "/>
				<outline text="*  Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, a staffer with the Minneapolis Star Tribune, tackles subjects like genealogy, Webcams and other topics of reader interest in a weekly Weblog launched in February 2000 that recently began appearing in the print newspaper as well. "/>
				<outline text="*  Aaron Barnhart, television columnist for the Kansas City Star, publishes a Weblog at TVBarn.com. "/>
				<outline text="*  Boston Globe business reporter D.C. Denison recently began writing a tech-news Weblog. "/>
				<outline text="*  Derek Willis writes a Weblog called The Scoop for Congressional Quarterly and publishes another on his personal site. "/>
				<outline text="*  Suzanne Lainson writes a blog about the Colorado tech scene, written in the style of a society columnist, for Courtney Pulitzer's The Cyber Scene. &quot;It turns out it has been a much more enjoyable experience than I had ever imagined,&quot; Lainson says by e-mail. &quot;I can write about people, companies and events that wouldn't be considered newsworthy in a traditional sense. While I do incorporate serious reporting, I offer considerable commentary  a good chunk of it done tongue in cheek.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="*  Kathy Shaidle, a religion columnist for the Toronto Star, publishes the Relapsed Catholic Weblog. "/>
				<outline text="*  The Guardian in the United Kingdom run a good international-news Weblog. "/>
				<outline text="* OJR's long-running Spike Report dishes up interesting factoids culled from online news publications. Slate's Today's Papers and Omnivore cover similar blog-like turf. "/>
				<outline text="*  A number of alternative weeklies, such as the San Francisco Bay Guardian, run Weblogs. "/>
				<outline text="*  The Christian Science Monitor plans to launch five topic-based blogs in about a month. "/>
				<outline text="For a list of Weblogs, Eatonweb publishes lists broken down by category, while Yahoo lists dozens of popular sites and Userland posts a running tally of its Top 100 sites. "/>
				<outline text="A word about the term Weblog: We'll focus here on Weblogs in the strict sense (where the content may run from journals and diaries to political screeds or travelogues, but the owner-publisher decides whether anyone else may post) rather than the more loosely defined genre that we'll call collective Weblogs (community news sites such as Slashdot.org, Kuro5hin.org, Freerepublic.com), which resemble forums but whose content relies heavily on links, short news snippets, essays, rants and other blog-like features. "/>
				<outline text="What does Weblogging herald for journalism? Here are perspectives from three significant figures in the Weblog movement: "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dan Gillmor">
				<outline text="Dan Gillmor, business columnist for the Mercury News, was the first mainstream journalist to author a Weblog and have it published on a newspaper Web site. His eJournal runs daily, with excerpts published in the print edition. "/>
				<outline text="Among his peers, Gillmor is considered the leading trailblazer of this new online journalism form, but he's typically modest about the mark he's made. &quot;I'm still feeling my way into it, so I don't know the big answers here,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone's still kind of groping about where this is all heading, but Weblogs have already become a significant phenomenon.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Regular readers of Gillmor's eJournal will recognize his commitment to user participation. &quot;One of the things I'm sure about in journalism right now is that my readers know more than I do,&quot; he says. &quot;To the extent that I can take advantage of that in a way that does something for everyone involved  that strikes me as pretty cool.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="One fascinating aspect of Gillmor's Weblog is how he lifts the veil from the workings of the journalism profession. &quot;There have been occasions where I put up a note saying, 'I'm working on the following and here's what I think I know,' and the invitation is for the reader to either tell me I'm on the right track, I'm wrong, or at the very least help me find the missing pieces,&quot; he says. &quot;That's a pretty interesting thing. Many thousands more people read my column in the newspaper than online, but I do hear back from a fair number of people from the Weblog.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Gillmor rates the interactivity with readers as one of the most striking features about blogs. &quot;I frequently hear from readers after a column, saying, 'That was interesting, but have you thought about this or that angle?,' and often the answer is no, I hadn't, so the next time I return to the subject the missing piece makes its way into the article. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;I think journalists have to do that. I doubt there is a beat at any newspaper or publication or program where it is not the case that the readers collectively know more than the reporter,&quot; he says. &quot;That shouldn't come as any great revelation. Anyone who's dealt with networks knows that the network knows more than the individual.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="While other newspapers have been reluctant to embrace the form, Gillmor says, &quot;In my case it helps that I'm working for people whose reaction is not fear and loathing but, Wow, that sounds interesting, let's see how it works.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="He encourages other publications to weigh the possible benefits of launching a Weblog. &quot;Journalists need to experiment more as a group  not with our core values or with things like getting it right, but with things like how we produce news. We're just going to get dull if we don't. We're in the midst of a change, where journalism is changing from a lecture into something that resembles something between a conversation and a seminar, and that's pretty exciting to me.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="For journalists thinking of taking up Weblogging, he cautions, &quot;It's important to recognize that it takes a fair amount of work to do it right. Man, this is a beast that's hungry all the time.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Gillmor says professional journalism needs to make room for a new brand of amateur journalism that Weblogs are helping to fashion. &quot;No question, this is another kind of journalism. Technology has been leading us toward new ways of looking at things, and the idea of talented amateurs becoming part of the conversation is just the next logical step. It's the model of the pamphleteer journalist. Will the pamphleteer journalist become Gannett? No, but I don't think the pamphleteer wants to be Gannett.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="He pauses and considers the future of blogging. &quot;Let's see where it takes us,&quot; he says, &quot;because clear as hell it's taking us somewhere interesting.&quot; "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Doc Searls">
				<outline text="Doc Searls, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., is a veteran journalist, computer industry analyst and senior editor for Linux Journal. He's best known as one of four authors of The Cluetrain Manifesto, a near-mythic essay that laid out 95 theses about the new reality of marketplaces in a networked world. "/>
				<outline text="When Searls began his blog in November 1999, he found 9,000 search engine results for the term Weblog. That number has since grown to more than 624,000. "/>
				<outline text="He launched the Weblog as an online counterpart to the book publication of Cluetrain. &quot;But in the course of that I discovered that Weblogs are really personal, and as soon as you pluralize a voice, it loses some of its meaning,&quot; he says. "/>
				<outline text="Searls believes that blogs offer the news media a means of &quot;re-personalizing journalism,&quot; through their subject matter and by connecting journalists to other journalists' journals and to expert sources. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;That's what Weblogs offer to journalism,&quot; he says. &quot;Weblogs are personal journalism. For real journalists who aren't used to writing without a net, Weblogs have a self-informing and self-correcting system built into it. When Dan Gillmor published an item whose source said it wasn't ready for public dissemination, Dan apologized and took it off his Weblog, and that increased his stature. You can't do that with a regular paper  you'd get a retraction instead.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="One of the interesting hallmarks of a successful Weblog is that it becomes an authoritative source of information based on community endorsement. &quot;People link to it, and those links increase the site's authority and raise its profile in as natural a way as possible,&quot; Searls says. &quot;So what we have is a marketplace in which we grant authority to those we trust to alter or author our own opinions. I let Dan supply me with many of my opinions because he's really good, not because his name is on the masthead of a print publication. Many of the Weblogs I visit have no connection to the print world.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="While many blogs get dozens or hundreds of visitors, Searls' site attracts thousands. &quot;I partly don't want to care what the number is,&quot; he says. &quot;I used to work in broadcasting, where everyone was obsessed by that. I don't want an audience. I feel I'm writing stuff that's part of a conversation. Conversations don't have audiences.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Searls says the media remain blind to the cultural and technological changes that are overtaking traditional modes of communication. &quot;What's happening to every business is they're melting into the marketplace,&quot; he says. &quot;It comes as a profound revelation to most in the first world when they discover that markets are a conversation. But in the third world that's a given  market's are a bazaar, not a conveyor belt moving goods. They're about relationships and connoisseurship and social life  not something you can describe in accounting language. We forget that the price tag is only 125 years old. Before that, everything was negotiated. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;When we think about media or journalism,&quot; Searls says, &quot;you have content that's loaded in a channel and delivered to a target group or demographic. That's just not applicable to the world of Weblogs, where you go looking for interesting conversations, where you might run into soccer moms and students discussing Plato and a whole noisy marketplace speaking to itself. Journalism is going to have to get used to making room for lots of other people who are not journalists by training but who are just moved by whatever their nature happens to be.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Searls agrees with Gillmor (as do I) that many Weblog authors are assuming the role of amateur journalists. &quot;Just because you don't get paid for writing a blog doesn't mean you're any less authoritative,&quot; he says. (He writes more about what he calls &quot;soft journalism&quot;  the any-to-any system of talking and sharing rather than the traditional &quot;hard journalism&quot; model of writing that is distributed to the masses  in an essay on his blog.) "/>
				<outline text="Searls finds himself writing often in his blog about Linux, open-source software and the hacker community because those topics reflect his interests as senior editor at Linux Journal. &quot;The blog serves as a kind of steam valve for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I put stuff out there that I'm forming an opinion about, and another blogger starts arguing with me and giving me feedback, and I haven't even finished what I was posting!&quot; "/>
				<outline text="For mainstream journalists, Searls believes that Weblogs will become an indispensable source of niche expertise. &quot;For certain kinds of listings, farmer's markets, community events, movie reviews and the like, it's just a matter of time before traditional media give blogs their due. One loser in all this may be the traditional sources of authority  the analyst houses and think tanks and talking heads. They'll be quoted less because they're not part of the conversation. They won't be your sources of authority anymore. The Weblog community is basically a whole bunch of expert witnesses who increase their expertise constantly through a sort of reputation engine.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Weblogs are already becoming an important source of news for readers. Searls says he found out that the author Douglas Adams died by reading the news and an appreciation on Dave Winer's blog. Says Searls: &quot;I'd spent that day in the car listening to news stations in Santa Barbara and heard not a word about it  and he died in Santa Barbara! I picked up the local paper the next day and there wasn't a single word in there about his death. I was astonished. &quot; "/>
				<outline text="Does Searls have any advice for aspiring bloggers? &quot;You don't have to be a good writer. What matters is meaning. What you need is passion  a deep interest in a subject  and then all you have to do is say something interesting. For us readers, it's actually a bit like eavesdropping. Who do I want to drop in on unannounced?&quot; "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="David Winer">
				<outline text="Winer, founder and CEO of Userland Software in Silicon Valley, has been credited as the first regular, widely followed blogger. He started Scripting News, a Weblog about technology, business and other Weblogs, in early 1997, and began Weblogging in early 1995 (&quot;it wasn't called Weblogging then,&quot; he notes). "/>
				<outline text="Userland's software products power tens of thousands of Weblogs. But for Winer, blogs are not just a publishing medium but a personal crusade that could foster a new brand of journalism. (He wrote about amateur journalism on his DaveNet site.) His dream is to put a live Web server with easy-to-edit pages on every person's desktop, then connect them all in a robust network that feeds off itself and informs other media. "/>
				<outline text="Winer might well be the godfather of the blogging movement, but a better term might be agent provocateur. His blog is peppered with musings, pointers to other sites, and Molotov cocktails that he lobs in the hope of sparking a lively debate. &quot;We're all players in Uncle Dave's court,&quot; Searls says. Adds journalist-blogger Glenn Fleishman: &quot;When you look at your stat sheet and see that your traffic spiked by 900 percent, you know that Dave has linked to you.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="How great is Winer's influence among bloggers? When I asked Gillmor and Searls what spurred them to start a blog, both said the idea came from Winer. "/>
				<outline text="For months Winer, a software developer and technology columnist for Hotwired in 1995-96, has denied that he's a journalist. But he now says, &quot;I've finally resolved in my mind that I am a journalist. It's not how I earn my living, but I'd argue there's no less quality and integrity in being an amateur journalist. Maybe there's more integrity, because my writing doesn't depend on a paycheck.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Winer stirred the pot April 17 with a provocative essay on Web publishing that concluded: &quot;writers who work for others have less integrity to offer than those who do it for love.&quot; That drew retorts from Fleishman, Deborah Branscum, Searls and others, while Gillmor also chimed in. "/>
				<outline text="Winer often returns to the theme  familiar to any journalist who has wandered through Usenet or other back alleys of the Internet  that professional journalists are inherently compromised by the business interests and skewed editorial policies of their publications. (Winer would use language a tad stronger.) "/>
				<outline text="Says Winer: &quot;Some of the success I've had as a software developer is related to the fact that I'd had the ability to put my own story out there (on Scripting News), where I don't have to deal with cynical reporters who are interested only if it's being pushed by a big-name company or by editors who insist on dumbing down a concept because they think it's too complicated for their readers to handle. What happens if the casualty in that process is the truth?&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Winer says journalists are ignoring the serious work being done on Weblogs, and online publishers should embrace the form. &quot;Then they won't have to worry about dumbing it down, and multiple points of view will be able to get through.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="He suggests that struggling sites like Salon begin broadening their content offerings by hosting user-created Weblogs, creating a sort of farm system for essayists. &quot;Salon could highlight the best ones on page one and invest time and effort in the ones that are inspiring and exceptional.&quot; He says online newspapers, too, should &quot;go out and let anyone write for you. That's scary for professionals, who'll be put off by writers who may be just as talented but didn't have the patience to climb your stupid career ladder.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Winer says he checks in on about 200 Weblogs on a regular basis. &quot;You do it not so much to see what it gives you,&quot; he says. &quot;It's more like checking in on a friend to see what's going on. It's like walking through a neighborhood, or reading columnists in a newspaper, even those you dislike because you enjoy the experience.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Winer has this advice for new bloggers: &quot;If you have a story to tell  even if it's about some really mundane aspect of your life  you'll attract others who share your interest. Just don't set a goal of becoming the most popular person on the block. If you work too hard to be politically correct, if you go back and change your Weblog because someone complained about something you posted, you'll wind up with writing that gets flat and boring. Self-censorship defeats the whole purpose of a Weblog.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Indeed, Winer says his most gratifying moments come when he posts an entry without running the idea by his colleagues first. &quot;It can be a very scary moment when you take a stand on something and you don't know if your argument holds together and you hit the send button and it's out there and you can't take it back. That's a moment that professional journalists may never experience in their careers, the feeling that it's just me, exposed to the world. That's a pretty powerful rush, the power to publish as an individual.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="Hey I was perplexed as anyone to get a heads-up from Microsoft PR in April about Craig Mundie's upcoming speech about open source at New York University on May 3. I read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/craig/05-03sharedsource.asp&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Hmmm,&quot; I thought, &quot;nothing new here.&quot; A few days later the predictable defensive rebuttal from people who had garnered a lot of press as leaders of the open source developer community."/>
				<outline text="Then the furor died down. I know why. There's not a lot of gas left in the open source hype balloon. That doesn't mean open source is over, quite the opposite, it just means people aren't talking about it as much anymore. We study this stuff in DaveNet. It's predictable. A couple of years after the hype rages, the cloud &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=dissipates&quot;&gt;dissipates&lt;/a&gt;, and it's time for something new."/>
				<outline text="Then late last week an interview with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer where he calls Linux a &lt;i&gt;cancer.&lt;/i&gt; What an awful thing to say about a nice operating system, and a competitor of theirs! Oy."/>
				<outline text="So why would Ballmer say something so nasty about Linux when open source is hardly an issue anymore? I wasn't really puzzled, I understood it (almost) from the get-go. Now I'm going to share the secret with you."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="In the meantime">
				<outline text="If you care about freedom for developers, look for other kinds of developers that you haven't worked with before. If you're a commercial developer, do deals with open source developers. Save the money you'd spend going to Microsoft's developer conference and spend it on making your software work better with Linux or Perl or Zope. "/>
				<outline text="And if you're an open source developer, skip the O'Reilly conference (Mundie is giving a keynote, what a waste of time!) and instead of posting yet another scathing exposee of the evil of Microsoft, learn about and point to something cool that a small commercial developer is doing. You might even get a consulting gig out of it. How's that for a business model."/>
				<outline text="It's the Zen-like way to win and at the same time save the soul of the Internet from being sucked behind the philosophical and intellectual firewall at Microsoft. No it can't be owned Bill, so stop trying. (Same message to the open source leaders.)"/>

				<outline text="On various mail lists, websites, newspapers and magazines, the discussion over Microsoft's Smart Tags continues. It's a great story, because for the first time press people have a clear picture of how Microsoft enters domains that previously were exempt from their control. Journalists can now feel, on a personal level, the full effect of Microsoft's dominance or monopoly in Web browsers. Have you been wondering what Microsoft would do once it controlled the browser? It's the old Embrace and Extend strategy, applied to e-commerce, literature, and journalism. "/>
				<outline text="Of course they call it innovation, but I see it as a shutdown of the Web, as we've known it. A first step down a slippery slope that ends with us all writing for Microsoft, with no independence, no integrity, worldwide. This is something that even our conservative government might want to stop. Microsoft will not only be compromising free speech, but also will be empowered to insert their commercial messages into communication between vendors and their customers, in all product categories, not just software and services.

			<outline text="The shakeout from heaven">
				<outline text="The changes in the Web just in the last week have revealed issues that lay hidden during the dot-com boom. A new literary and journalism medium was right under the surface. Now issues of integrity are revealed -- who do you trust, and how accountable are our sources of information. In this Web and print writers are allies, there's no difference in what we do. "/>
				<outline text="An example. This morning the Register ran a story saying that MSNBC had doctored a Wall Street Journal article to make it more favorable to Microsoft. Within a few hours we had rebuttals from an editor at the WSJ and from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/leeGomesOnStoryDoctoring.gif&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of the article, saying it was untrue. Since when have reporters had this kind of accountability? This is simply a revolution, I can't imagine that the reporters won't be much more careful in the future. Just the appearance of impropriety is an issue that's likely to be raised in the new medium. "/>
				<outline text="This also will mean more integrity from vendors, as Dan Gillmor and I learned this week, as we quickly figured out, with the help of a geek friend in the Netherlands, &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3future.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;Sjoerd Visscher&lt;/a&gt;, that Microsoft was at least bending the truth about Smart Tags. This question was raised on the San Jose Mercury website within a few minutes of it being reported on Scripting News. Just think -- six years ago people were marveling that the Dallas newspaper was willing to scoop itself on the Web. Now the news is happening on the Web, we have much higher bandwidth, and if you care about the truth, your work will get air. That's totally new. Amateurs working with pros, with pride."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Geeks scratch their heads">
				<outline text="Without exception journalists say no to Microsoft's Smart Tags. The geeks scratch their heads wondering why the journalists see issues of integrity, but the proposed Microsoft technology cuts right to the core of what we do. It will confuse readers. Why does the word &quot;shark&quot; point to a San Jose hockey team and not to a sea animal or a high-tech exec? Who added that link? Has this author lost his mind? Why is he promoting Microsoft products? Why should we believe him? It looks like he sold out! (There's that pesky appearance of impropriety thing again.)"/>
				<outline text="Questions about proper use of annotation come up, and the questions seem to have answers. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="When is annotation OK?">
				<outline text="It's OK if you can clearly see who's saying what."/>
				<outline text="It should be possible to take a Web document, specified through its URL, add comments, creating a new Web document identified by its own URL, and then publish that URL, probably on a weblog, clearly marked as Juan's annotations of Alice's document. Juan should not be allowed to mark up the document pointed to by the original URL because that would cloud the authorship of the document, and this would destroy its integrity."/>
				<outline text="If it's unclear who said what, then there is no integrity."/>
				<outline text="Further, it should be up to Alice to decide if annotations are allowed on her documents. Software developed by reputable vendors should respect her wishes. There are many other ways to express ones' opinion without marking up a document. This column is one example. A weblog is another. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is integrity?">
				<outline text="According to dictionary.com, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=integrity&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;The quality or condition of being whole or undivided; completeness.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="When you read my words on the Web or in print I want you to be sure you know that these are my words, my ideas, and you can judge me by them. (Knowing that I might change my mind later. Sorry.)"/>
				<outline text="If someone were to change the words that would not be good for the integrity of the writing. "/>
				<outline text="BTW, writing now includes links. It's part of the art."/>
				<outline text="Writing in Motley Fool, Todd Lebor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fool.com/news/2001/msft010608.htm&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Occasionally I'll throw a few links into an article that provide related news or more in-depth details about a topic I'm covering. I have control over that. If Microsoft were able to control -- and presumably charge for inserting these Smart Tags -- my shares of Microsoft might go up, but my goodwill feeling toward the company would go right out the window.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Same here. (Except I don't own any Microsoft shares.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Conclusion">
				<outline text="If it were not possible to read my words without annotation, we'd have to invent a medium that allowed that. But in 2001 we already have such a medium, it's called the Web. "/>
				<outline text="We have tools and servers and all kinds of runtimes on all kinds of operating systems."/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon">
				<outline text="Good afternoon, a short piece before a summer weekend, some things to think about while gardening, beach-going and barbecuing."/>
				<outline text="Last weekend talks broke off between AOL and Microsoft on renewing their bundling deal for Windows XP. AOL has the content advantage and Microsoft has the technology and developer advantage. Microsoft knows how to entice developers into locked trunks, or at least they used to; and AOL has the huge Time-Warner content machine to churn out stuff for people to read, watch and listen to; but AOL is not a developer-oriented culture."/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/590825.asp?0dm=C13QT&quot;&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt; a group of Silicon Valley venture capitalists met with Microsoft to learn about opportunities developing around and on top of Microsoft's new platform based on Hailstorm, SOAP and XML. They took a poll of the attendees, forty percent said they'd be comfortable investing alongside Microsoft. That's either high or low depending on how you look at it. I think it's high."/>
				<outline text="Meanwhile the Smart Tags mess provides a clue to the way the new Microsoft will work. More and more over time they will restrict and contrain and mold the Web to offset AOL's content advantage. The big question is will AOL be able to meet Microsoft in creating relationships with developers? As much as I'd like to believe that AOL could, it's a fantastic operational and marketing company, they have little experience working with developers, on any basis, with lots of lock-in or lots of freedom."/>
				<outline text="So I've come to see the next few years as a period when the Web will fork into possibly three different incompatible environments: One dominated by Microsoft, one by AOL, and one not dominated at all. I will not of course develop for any dominated platform. I insist that the Web is the platform without a platform vendor. I encourage all others, Microsoft and AOL included, to get behind this idea because long-term that's how it will shake out. "/>
				<outline text="Genies don't go back in bottles, Microsoft's glory days are behind them. Windows dominated in the early 90s because Apple and IBM left a vacuum and GUIs were at the leading edge and not yet a commodity. Now the Web is maturing, and no matter how much Ballmer screams &quot;XML XML!&quot; it either isn't going to happen or it isn't going to gel around Microsoft. Microsoft only knows dominance, they've proven it yet again, and XML is not about dominance, just as the Web could not flourish with the kind of control that Microsoft wants to impose now."/>
				<outline text="I am absolutely sure Microsoft will retract Smart Tags. Give it two weeks before the major non-AOL publications figure out what's going on. And don't forget the US government. I doubt if the White House or the Library of Congress want their websites annotated by a technology company. Remember they have tanks and nukes and trillions of dollars. Microsoft certainly has balls, but they must not understand how big the Web has gotten."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Don't be a deer">
				<outline text="This is not a good time to be a deer caught in the headlights. Remember, for all the supposed invincibility of Microsoft, they have never been able to blaze their own trail, they always needed something to catch up to, and of course now that is AOL. When past adversaries have lost to Microsoft it's because they let Microsoft call the shots. They waited for the dust to settle, and by the time that happened, their products were dead, their customers had moved on, and no one cared what they wanted. The list is long and well-recited. "/>
				<outline text="However, in all the history, there's no example of an adversary of Microsoft's who truly zigged to their zag, took advantage of the opportunities they left behind, the unserved constituencies. Netscape never had anything to say to Web developers. Sun tried to lock-in the Java developers. It's never happened that an independent developer community really banded together, for the good of all, to offer a true alternative to what Microsoft was offering. Today Microsoft has more in common with Ashton-Tate, unable to thwart the herd of developers jumping ship. Microsoft brought the exodus on themselves, by crossing the will of the Java developers, and now by trying to lock innocent Web publishers, large and small, behind a wall of editorial annotation. They are always undermining developers as they hype up their love of developers. When will the rest of us get hip to this?"/>
				<outline text="In today's scene, to zig to Microsoft's zag would mean applying enough resources, collectively, to produce several good alternatives to Microsoft's browser, ones which don't carry the lock-in burden and don't have to protect Microsoft Office. Such browsers would give more control to writers, designers and programmers, as Microsoft is taking 1984ish steps to take control for themselves, and would be a delightful writing tool far more appropriate to today's work environment than the aging and bloated Word, Powerpoint and Excel."/>
				<outline text="In other words, the opportunities for the technology industry have never been greater, but there's a lot of hard work to do, and you have to have a winning philosophy and excellent technology. To win now, you can't be a deer caught in the headlights, you have to stand tall, bet on technology, move with conviction and work with others."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/25/01; 10:15:42 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="And happy Monday."/>
				<outline text="A couple of pointers and a question."/>
				<outline text="This morning Microsoft released the preview version of MSIE 6 with Smart Tags."/>
				<outline text="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/preview/default.asp"/>
				<outline text="The info about Smart Tags is here."/>
				<outline text="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/preview/smarttags/default.asp"/>
				<outline text="Now the question."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Does Microsoft own the Web now?">
				<outline text="All the arguments have been deployed and now so has the software."/>
				<outline text="Later maybe we'll look back on this as the moment when the Web crossed into Microsoft ownership. Sometimes it's not entirely evident at the time when a line was crossed, but imho, this is it."/>
				<outline text="Microsoft promises an opt-out to websites, which must sound good to some. Now give it a few weeks to sink in -- there are going to be lots of demos of this stuff in boardrooms, I hope, if the Web wants to retain any kind of independence from Microsoft. Of course they may have another set of controversies for reporters to cover by then. They're good at poking hornet's nests. (It's so easy, what leverage they have with the press.)"/>
				<outline text="But the issue won't go away quickly. It's just dawning on people who manage websites how much it's going to cost to opt-out. Every page on every site has to be modified. It's a firedrill like the one we did for Y2K, only this time there's not so much time to prepare. And how many more firedrills will there be this year and next? How many more &quot;smart&quot; features are coming and is there any guarantee that we'll even be able to opt-out?"/>
				<outline text="It would have been much more fair and reasonable to require an opt-in on the part of websites. It would be a minor change to their code. That way we could try the feature before commiting all our web content to Microsoft's new idea of linking on the Web. Instead we have to scurry and waste a ton of time and money to keep integrity in our work."/>
				<outline text="Now the discussion will percolate to other places, boardrooms and then perhaps courtrooms. The Web is really big now, even though there's been a bust in Dot-Com-Land, a huge amount of money and the content of many media empires, universities, businesses and governments, large and small, flow through Microsoft's browser. I don't believe they're all just going to shrug it off. We'll see."/>

			<outline text="On the record">
				<outline text="If you've been paying attention this morning I'm sure you already know that the US Appeals Court decision has been issued in the Microsoft antitrust case. I'm reading it now between interviews. The initial spin has been that it's a victory for Microsoft, and that's understandable based on reading the first few pages, but keep going, they affirm almost all of the lower court's rulings, with gusto. "/>
				<outline text="I found myself cheering at places where the judges stood up for the rights of independent developers, especially in regard to Microsoft's acts to undermine Netscape (and Web developers) and to thwart Java and its developers who legitimately wanted Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA). While they chastized Jackson for improprieties they didn't have any special affection for Microsoft, calling them on outright lies, and at one point calling their excuses &quot;lame&quot;."/>
				<outline text="In the past it was very difficult to be a developer with integrity, because the rules were so perverted by the misbehavior of the largest companies in our industry, not just Microsoft. The judges put in writing some basic principles about how platform vendors must deal with independent developers. Now it seems the next step is for a new trial, and although I'm not a lawyer it seems only reasonable, given the number of violations of antitrust law that Microsoft has been found guilty of, that some protections be put in place immediately to stop Microsoft from doing more harm while the new trial is proceeding."/>
				<outline text="A common question in the interviews has been &quot;Is this in any way related to Microsoft's withdrawal of Smart Tags yesterday?&quot; and I think not, except that this might a time for reflection at Microsoft on its overall way of doing business. The next hot issue, although does not appear to be an issue for integrity in Web writing, will be the tying of Windows XP to Passport and HailStorm. "/>
				<outline text="At any point in this process Microsoft could decide to change the way it does business. It's still probably not too late to do that."/>

			<outline text="The Micro Channel Architecture">
				<outline text="Let's go back in time to the PC industry of 1987."/>
				<outline text="Things were moving really fast. In the late 70s and early 80s Apple had risen to the top of the early personal computer vendors. Steve Jobs was a cultural icon, deservedly, on covers of so many magazines. He told a revolutionary story -- computers could be human-scale tools, not just data processing systems for large corporations. He described the Apple II as a fractional-horsepower computer, and hit the nail on the head. "/>
				<outline text="In 1981 IBM introduced the PC and took the leadership from Apple. Looking back I think the reason it worked so well is simply that the PC had much more memory than Apple's computer. "/>
				<outline text="Then came Compaq and then other cloners. Where IBM was slow and lumbering and arrogant, Compaq sold us the products we wanted, and forced IBM to climb a very uncomfortable curve. IBM could see the future clearly, and didn't like it. The inexpensive fractional-horsepower desktop computers were quickly becoming as powerful as the multi-million dollar mainframes that were IBM's mainstay."/>
				<outline text="In 1987 IBM made their move, releasing a three-way noose for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=nascent&quot;&gt;nascent&lt;/a&gt; independent computer industry lead by Compaq. The three components were the PS/2, OS/2 and the secret sauce -- the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/reference/dictionary/terms/M/Micro_Channel_Architecture.htm&quot;&gt;Micro Channel Architecture&lt;/a&gt;."/>
				<outline text="What a beautiful crock it was. I'm no expert on bus architectures. Probably one person in a million understood what it was, and no one had a clue why it was so killer (it wasn't) and that's why it was so effective at clouding the judgment of so many. We simply didn't understand what they were talking about."/>
				<outline text="Compaq, with its death designed, responded with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/Resources/Info/Glossary/Terms/eisa.html&quot;&gt;EISA&lt;/a&gt;, an open equivalent of the MCA. We saw their moves as pathetic death &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=throes&quot;&gt;throes&lt;/a&gt;, but it worked! Today the Micro Channel Architecture is a historic curiosity. IBM guessed wrong, we loved their PC, but when IBM wanted to kill it, we said no."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Zoom forward in time">
				<outline text="In 1993 everyone thought Bill Gates knew where the software industry was going. If you stood up and said &quot;Some random person you've never heard of is going to define where this industry is going,&quot; everyone at Stewart's or Esther's would have laughed, what a silly idea, that's not how the world really works. "/>
				<outline text="If you're shaking your head in agreement, think again. The &quot;random person&quot; was an amalgam of Tim Berners-Lee, Jim Clarke and Marc Andreessen. I wonder if any of them dared to believe, as Steve Jobs clearly did, that they were playing such a pivotal role in technology. As the Web grew it killed every advanced project at Microsoft. None of the people who anticipated the Web worked at Microsoft, if they had, there's no doubt Microsoft would have killed the idea -- it was too open, too fair, and it undermined all their plans. "/>
				<outline text="You could visibly see them figure this out at Microsoft in 1994 and 1995, and now in 2001 the Web is as much Microsoft's as the PC was IBM's in 1987. And now they're making the same fundamental mistake that IBM made, they're going to try to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=foreclose&quot;&gt;foreclose&lt;/a&gt; on the Web, all the annoyance and disconcert will be organized to feed their machine, according to the plan."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The killer triumvirate">
				<outline text="Microsoft's killer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=triumvirate&quot;&gt;triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; is Passport, .NET and the secret sauce -- HailStorm. It's a total lockdown, just what IBM proposed after quelling the Apple-lead insurrection as they tried to dispose of Compaq and the cloners. This time what's at stake is the locked-in-ness of Windows and Office. I think Microsoft guessed wrong. We love the Web, now that Microsoft wants to kill it, we will say no."/>
				<outline text="It's so clear, what comes next is the open equivalent of what Microsoft is proposing, as EISA was the open version of the MCA. The art of membership is clear, it's not rocket science, and it's not worth giving Microsoft a lock-in. .NET is merely a runtime environment and a set of development tools, not unlike Zope, Java or my own Frontier. Since .NET supports SOAP and XML-RPC, we can implement interfaces to the EISA-of-the-Web in Microsoft's environment. "/>
				<outline text="There appears to be nothing controversial about .NET. But HailStorm -- that's the mystery. Where I didn't know much about bus archtitectures in 1987, I know lots about schema for everyday data, calendars, business cards, mail messages, weblogs, spreadsheets, outlines, etc. I bet that the schema of HailStorm are going have poison pills, probably patents, all kinds of non-disclosures, but the technology is thin. We'll have to fight them the way Compaq fought IBM. And unless there's something I'm missing, Microsoft will hit the same wall that IBM did. Their motto of 2001 might well be Who wants to be locked in the trunk today?"/>
				<outline text="The 1990s were a great period of growth for Microsoft, but they may have missed the message. We want our independence. The users will want that too. As the tie-ins in Windows XP become evident, there will be more disaster stories as the full effect of Microsoft's lockdown is felt by users. They'll look for other ways to get what they want. Let's make sure they have choice."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/9/01; 12:01:08 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Executive summary">
				<outline text="This is a longish rambly piece. I'm not totally happy with it, but I want the conclusion to get out asap. The intended audience is the leadership of various non-Microsoft scripting communities. If we had a common marketing department, and if I were your director of product marketing, I'd write a memo like this. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Ever have an epiphany?">
				<outline text="If you've ever had an epiphany, you'll know what I felt like debating Web Services on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork&quot;&gt;FoRK&lt;/a&gt; mail list in response to a question from analyst and venture capitalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/&quot;&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted to know if any Web services had actually been deployed. Oh yeah, you betcha, I said."/>
				<outline text="Then the Unix guys speak up and say they've been doing it all along, and too bad people like me are just discovering them now. The usual arrogance, of course I know what Unix does, that's where I learned to program, but then I figured out something new."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Source-level integration">
				<outline text="First I want to say that having the source to someone else's work can make bug-reporting a more precise art, if people bother to dig in and understand the source code. But if you want to integrate without forcing a fork, you need a higher level approach. And while some kinds of functionality are better if integrated at a source code level, with today's fast CPUs and ubiquitous networking, there are lots of places where it's not necessary if the interfaces exist."/>
				<outline text="OK, so here's part of the epiphany -- what people were calling open source is mostly Unix with a new name. It makes total sense that Unix would be strongly associated with open source, because source-level integration is the custom on platforms that have no easy higher-level way to bolt together functionality in different source code bases. It's a total difference in culture, but not so different on closer examination."/>
				<outline text="In the early 90s we invented higher level protocols on Windows and Mac -- COM and Apple Events, at their best they are Unix-inspired, clean, low-tech, free of lock-in. And interestingly it was done on Unix too, it's called HTTP, and it's the basis for the Web, and is a marvel of simplicity and power. Right on. It was quickly adopted on all platforms, not just Unix. But still, to this day, source-code-level integration is the norm on Unix where it's practically unheard-of in the commercial world. Is it any wonder that commercial developers invented SOAP and XML-RPC? We couldn't make the Web work for our software without doing that. "/>
				<outline text="So why is this interesting? Because it explains why Unix developers, to the extent that they have leadership, are going the source code way, by cloning .NET, when a much less expensive and more likely to work strategy is staring them in the face. The epiphany that's waiting for others, is that to meet Microsoft in the market, you must adopt a bit of their culture, and that's all you have to do."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Miguel and Craig">
				<outline text="I've watched over the last few months as &lt;a href=&quot;http://primates.helixcode.com/~miguel/&quot;&gt;Miguel de Icaza&lt;/a&gt;, who I respect enormously, who also contributed to the epiphany, has approached competing with Microsoft. He's leading a group that's cloning Microsoft .NET at a company called Ximian. His project is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ximian.com/newsitems/mono_announce.php3&quot;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;."/>
				<outline text="Now, at the same time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigburton.com/2001/07/08&quot;&gt;Craig Burton&lt;/a&gt;, the former chief strategist at Novell, who I also admire, is counseling what he calls &quot;redirection&quot; which, on investigation, proves to be a much lighter burden to carry."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The first clue">
				<outline text="The first clue should be that Microsoft is not protecting the source of .NET, in fact they're publishing it, with some constraints, but if you want to see how they do it, they say there will be no mysteries and no poison pills. So they're making it not impossible to clone. Why are they being so generous? (A little sarcasm, sorry.) "/>
				<outline text="Further if you can get all the services by coming to Miguel or you or me, plus freedom of choice, some part of the market is going to go for that. I'd argue it's the most important part -- independent developers. The new ideas will happen everywhere but Microsoft. If we do it right, where they have the burden of protecting all parts of Microsoft, and the rest of us have none of that."/>
				<outline text="But cloning .NET is a lot of work, and a path that Microsoft controls. Is it really necessary to do all that to compete with them? I think not, read on."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The second clue and a zig">
				<outline text="Microsoft is flashing a big red light called SOAP and it's a big clue. If you just make sure that your current environment, Python, Perl, Tcl, Java, whatever, can plug into the SOAP network and interop with everything Microsoft is doing, there is (drum roll please) nothing more to do, at least at that level. (There will be interfaces at higher levels that need to be supported, eventually.)"/>
				<outline text="We already have the perfect zig to their zag. .NET is about integrating all popular programming languages in one runtime and development system. The rest of us love diversity, and that's a good bet because diversity is what we have right now. "/>
				<outline text="So while I admire Miguel's courage, the first thing to do is to make sure that we all have excellent interop with each other &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Microsoft. Look for appropriate points of integration using protocols and not source code integration and we've got it nailed. And hope that the courts keep them from being too destructive (so far so good). In other words, keep doing what we're doing."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Conclusion">
				<outline text="Any scripting language can be boosted to .NET-competitive status simply by making SOAP 1.1 and XML-RPC support a standard part of the install and docs. Hardly any technical work is needed. "/>
				<outline text="In other words Python is already a worthy competitor to .NET. Anyone developing in Python should know they don't have to budge an inch to be part of the new network. Same with every other scripting language and environment. There's no reason to switch or freeze or wait. Get unconfused now."/>
				<outline text="Yes, it's mostly marketing, and yes my programmer friends, marketing counts."/>

				<outline text="I really enjoy explaining new technology to investors, and from what Chris tells me, they liked hearing from a person who really does development, and isn't selling pet food or promoting other weird business models. This is a sign that perhaps some sobriety and respect are returning to the tech investment environment, that technology may again have a chance to attract investment, and that independent software developers have a voice that matters. As always, none of this can work unless we work together. Some projects will make money, and others will build infrastructure and guarantee choice and probably not make money, but will still be worth doing. Technology has never been an easy investment, the euphoria which is dead-dead-dead masked that for a few years. To do this well, we have to communicate, and Monday's conference call was an excellent beginning. "/>
				<outline text="Also many thanks to the US Court of Appeals for standing up for independent software developers. They didn't make a distinction between one operating system or another, they didn't protect commercial developers in favor of open source developers, or vice versa. They said they want independent developers to have a chance, and that's more support than we've gotten from our opinion leaders who seem to want to hand the whole thing to Microsoft or their adversary du jour. I want diversity and choice and a steady way for new ideas to enter the market. I'm glad that our government agrees."/>

			<outline text="A proposal">
				<outline text="Here's a revised proposal to restore competition to the Web browser market.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove the browser from Microsoft, creating an independent company, call it BrowserCo.&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the split, Microsoft would not be allowed to make a Web browser, for five years, and then only if a competitive market has developed, and then only under restrictive conditions that make sure that a competitive market continues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft may, if they choose to, add APIs to Windows to allow the HTML rendering engine to be a plug-in. The user would be offered a choice of browsers, none of which would be pre-installed with Windows. The BrowserCo browser would be on the list, but it could not be the first choice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The settlement would include enough cash to fund expanded development of the browser for five years, assuming no revenue from software sales.&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;BrowserCo would be free to merge with or acquire other companies at any time.&lt;/ol&gt;Management of BrowserCo will either find a business model, or be subject to fierce competition, or the industry will have moved on and HTML browsing will no longer be considered a key technology. No matter what, the lack of a competitive environment in browsers will have been alleviated."/>
				<outline text="BrowserCo is free to compete with Windows or Office, something that the Microsoft-owned browser clearly can't do. This is necessary because the Web has been crippled by Microsoft's insistence that these old products be preserved, contrary to Microsoft's claim that they are the source of innovation."/>
				<outline text="This remedy would put in place a template for future remedies if Microsoft or others act illegally to destroy competitive markets. If you compete illegaly, you lose the product and a lot of cash, and create a strong competitor. This would force temperence and respect for competition, one way or the other you're going have to deal with it. "/>
				<outline text="Let's have no more monopolies in software, we've seen how awful they are, let's fix the problems caused by the latest round of monopolization, and get a structural fix in place to make it less likely in the future."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Distributed Membership and Preferences&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/17/01; 6:57:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Background">
				<outline text="Membership and preferences standards are a hot topic among independent developers, because of Microsoft's Passport, which is in rapid deployment."/>
				<outline text="So developers are now faced with a choice -- support Microsoft's membership system, and thereby feed customers to them, or develop a unified, open, clonable and decentralized system, so that membership is a competitive space, not owned by one or two large companies. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Privacy vs publishing">
				<outline text="The core issue is privacy. How do you control the information you provide about yourself? Are you transmitting data over secure lines to people you trust? In a chain where the weakest link determines how private your information is, can there be any realistic guarantee of privacy?"/>
				<outline text="In 2001, the best advice, as a computing professional, that I can offer is: 1. Assume your data are not private. 2. If you want to maintain privacy, don't put the data on a computer network and 3. All membership systems must offer each user an easy way to copy all the content being stored in a cloud for backup or to allow relocation."/>
				<outline text="Once you make a decision about privacy vs publishing, the design falls out. Of course I have to go with publishing because it's realistic. The Internet is a fantastic publishing environment. On the other side, I don't think you can build a membership system in 2001 and make any guarantees of privacy. So once privacy is disclaimed, the problem is simply stated."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Membership and preferences at UserLand">
				<outline text="UserLand has a mostly decentralized membership system. Every Manila site we host, and ones that are hosted by our licensees, has its own membership. We also have a special thing with userland.com, its membership info &lt;i&gt;percolates&lt;/i&gt; across a group of machines that host userland.com sites. The synchronization is done in XML-RPC, it could easily be done in SOAP. "/>
				<outline text="The frustration of decentralized systems, as expressed by many users of our software, is that it's cumbersome to enter your information manually for every site you want to join. Isn't there some way to automate this? Of course there is, but then we get into the issue of privacy, and that's guaranteed to be a controversial issue."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="How decentralized membership should work">
				<outline text="When I sign up to a new site, call this the &lt;i&gt;dependent site,&lt;/i&gt; I wish there were a You Know Me button I could click that would link membership in this site to some other site I am already a member of. "/>
				<outline text="A dialog appears, I enter a string that identifies both a server and my member name, call this server the &lt;i&gt;legacy site.&lt;/i&gt; A message is sent from the dependent site to the legacy site asking for the URL of a static XML document that contains my membership information, call it member.xml. At the same time the legacy site adds a subscription to the XML document so that the dependent site can receive notification when I change it. member.xml is a public resource, its URL is discoverable.

				<outline text="UserLand has specified an XML-RPC and SOAP 1.1 interface for such a system, it's the basis for the upstreaming feature in Radio UserLand. This is how we want to migrate, from a centralized system where we host sites, to one where more of the work is done by users' personal computers, where the centralized functionality makes information publicly available for users behind firewalls, NAT or low-bandwidth connections."/>

			<outline text="Four criteria">
				<outline text="The four criteria are: unified, open, clonable and decentralized. The last three are inevitable and relatively easy. The first one, unification, is the hardest and least likely. But when things work on the Internet it's because unification was achieved. "/>
				<outline text="Look at the protocols and formats we use now, and think about how they were unified. Often as a result of competition. Sometimes because someone had a good idea and no one cared until a format or protocol had already gained traction. With membership and preferences there are a lot of ways to go, a lot of competing ways to do basically the same thing. The question is, will we be able to settle on a common interface or will Microsoft end up having exclusive control over the protocol. I don't see any other fork in the road."/>
				<outline text="The key phrase is &lt;i&gt;common interface.&lt;/i&gt; We can hide all the differences behind an XML-RPC and SOAP interface to invoke membership and preferences services. Imho, that's the key to unification."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's pretty simple">
				<outline text="Hopefully this frames the question and helps form a basis for discussion. We're looking for all software that can fill this need, not just our own, in the hope that we can have a common XML-RPC and SOAP-based interface for all such services. We're conversing with the XNS people, and think that Jabber can help. I've also been emailing with people at AOL about their work in this area. Now I hope to open a discussion with everyone who has an interest in this functionality so there's a chance of a unified and inclusive approach."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/18/01; 6:06:18 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A very thought-provoking development">
				<outline text="Earlier today Microsoft petitioned the Court of Appeals to reconsider its conclusion that Microsoft had improperly commingled code between Windows and their Web browser."/>
				<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/18/technology/18CND-SOFT.html"/>
				<outline text="This &quot;commingling&quot; formed the basis for Microsoft's argument that the Web browser should be integrated with the operating system. However with a little more effort they could have made it so that the HTML renderer was integrated through a programming interface, allowing the OEM or user to specify Netscape or some other browser as the system-level renderer. "/>
				<outline text="It would have been the natural thing to do. Creating those kinds of interfaces is exactly what an operating system vendor &lt;i&gt;does,&lt;/i&gt; that's what an operating system &lt;i&gt;is,&lt;/i&gt; a collection of such interfaces. Had Microsoft been acting as an ethical operating system vendor, it would have gone out of its way to maintain the competitive market that existed at the time of their integration of the browser with the operating system. Then their claims that they made a better browser and won the competition fairly would have some credibility."/>
				<outline text="It appears that Microsoft was expecting the court to be confused, and perhaps still does, but this is not a confusing issue. That Microsoft focused on this aspect of the judgment shows that this is where the juice is. Can Microsoft continue to control the Web through the browser or will they end up losing their monopoly in this key area? If so, my previously stated roadmap is the right way to go, imho."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Roadmap">
				<outline text="The correct remedy is to immediately force an API on Microsoft by removing the browser from the operating system by removing it from the company that makes the operating system. That will motivate Microsoft to quickly add the necessary interfaces, and will free the browser to compete with Microsoft's operating system and application suite. "/>
				<outline text="Others have expressed doubt that such competition would result from such a split, but as an expert in Web technology, I have no doubt that a stronger Web environment would immediately result. That MSIE has only rudimentary writing capabilities is clear evidence to me that Microsoft has been protecting Office by keeping the browser weak as a writing tool. The technology is well-known, and the potential of this combination was well-known before Microsoft took control of the browser market. It wouldn't be hard to make MSIE a serious competitor to Microsoft Word, and other elements of the Office suite, and if all is well, that will happen, as a natural consequence of new competition in the browser space."/>
				<outline text="I've outlined a roadmap for this split, in a DaveNet piece posted on July 12."/>
				<outline text="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/07/12/restoringCompetitionToTheBrowserMarket"/>
				<outline text="This solution cuts to the core of the issue with Microsoft's illegal competition in the browser market, provides a fair remedy, allowing the browser to become a market independent of Microsoft, and creates a template for future remedies for illegal competition in software markets. I ask that this roadmap be given serious consideration by Microsoft and the government as a settlement plan. I think the proper remedy is totally clear."/>

				<outline text="My Jamaican uncle calls them non-functional probabilities, events that seem related, with no apparent cause and effect linking them. They're so improbable that they couldn't fit on a numercial probability curve. In statistics such events are called outliers, some call them Acts of God, but I think they are Acts of Puppeteers, which is basically the same thing with a different spin."/>
				<outline text="All around us are puppeteers, beings so different from us that we can't perceive them, but they're here, like children playing with dolls, and we're the dolls. Each has temporary control of some number of puppets. The more powerful the puppeteer, the more interesting or numerous his or her puppets are. They make deals, one day the evil puppeteer has my strings, other days the insecure puppeteer. And on some days the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/02/21/greathair&quot;&gt;Great Hair&lt;/a&gt; puppeteer controls my existence."/>
				<outline text="Human dramas are merely plays that entertain the puppeteers, and to the extent we're conscious, teach us the lessons they wish us to learn. Over and over. And then again and again. The puppeteers only know a few plots."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="A $10 cab ride between two worlds">
				<outline text="Earlier this week there were two conferences in San Diego. One was the Open Source Convention, which is a rebel cause, hippies and programmers, often in the same body, high-fiving each other, reminiscent of the early days of the Mac, the Web, and whatever else is interesting, colorful and smelly in the software world."/>
				<outline text="The other conference was The Burton Group's Catalyst conference, a large convention of infrastructure managers in corporations, government and education. They get their software from Microsoft, Sun, IBM and a host of smaller infrastructure technology developers."/>
				<outline text="Earlier this week these two worlds were a $10 cab ride apart, although few participants knew of the existence of the other conference, I was invited to particpate in both, which lead to some interesting connections."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Connections">
				<outline text="Here are some random notes of things I learned from taking the $10 cab ride several times in both directions earlier this week."/>
				<outline text="1. Most of us are Internet developers. Maybe we all are. This is important because the philosophy of the Internet is a good philosophy."/>
				<outline text="2. Another thing we seem to agree on is freedom. I don't mean freedom as in free beer or in depriving honest software developers of their ill-gotten gains, I mean freedom as expressed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela.html&quot;&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln.html&quot;&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/franklin.html&quot;&gt;Aretha Franklin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.well.com/user/sunspot/&quot;&gt;Annie Lennox&lt;/a&gt;. After too many years of being locked in trunks by platform vendors it's time to Do It For Ourselves. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davemcnally.com/lyrics/Eurythmics/SistersAreDoinItForThemselves.asp&quot;&gt;Lyrics&lt;/a&gt;.)"/>
				<outline text="3. This reminds me why I came out of retirement in 1994. &quot;The Internet is the platform with no platform vendor.&quot; That's a big deal to me. "/>
				<outline text="4. Freedom and money are related, but you don't &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney#howMuchDoYouNeed&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; very much money to be free."/>
				<outline text="5. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.levity.com/corduroy/toole.htm&quot;&gt;A Confederacy of Dunces&lt;/a&gt; by John Kennedy Toole is one of my favorite books. It's very funny. Highly recommended. If you want to understand what's going on don't think of others being such a confederacy. Instead think of us all as dunce-like dancing puppets, and you'll be closer to Great Hair."/>
				<outline text="6. Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig says it's a long shot that the Bush Administration will pursue Microsoft effectively even though the Court of Appeals upheld the lower court decision, unanimously, 7-0. Today's it's not just one judge, but eight, who say Microsoft broke the law. Now Lessig is the expert on the courts, but I know something about developers. Microsoft's pitch to developers is weakened because of the upheld conviction. Developers have minds. They can see how the locked trunk works. Who wants to help Bill build another sub-campus in Redmond? Maybe that's not such a bad idea, but only if we have freedom of choice everywhere. We ask that Microsoft adopt a new philosophy, consider it a bug when users and developers don't have choice. It was not just illegal to integrate the browser into the OS without user choice, but it was also a breach of our common values as technology professionals. Microsoft has always had a one-sided conversation about ethical behavior of operating system vendors. Thanks to the court for making this a multi-sided conversation."/>
				<outline text="7. At the open source summit on Tuesday we had long discussions on patents, identity and vision. I said it was time to lose the Unix religion. It's a great OS, in all its incarnations, but let's also include the popular user-oriented operating systems, Windows and Macintosh. On patents, I said the train had left the station, there's not anything in particular we can do about them but wait for a meltdown and when it happens make sure that people know that patents are the reason they're not getting the software they want. "/>
				<outline text="8. I preached inclusion, as did Tim O'Reilly and Doc Searls. This relates to everything for all time. A commercial developer who doesn't patent is a friend of the open source community. An open source platform that fosters commercial development is a friend to the venture capitalists. Anyone who innovates is good for progress. Let's stop being so black and white, as more leading companies of open source shift to a mixed model, we all have to hit the reset button, as Microsoft does, and figure out who our friends are. The philosophy of inclusion, support for independent developers, and a disclaimer of lock-in are the things that matter as we go forward. To me, this is what it means to be an Internet developer."/>
				<outline text="9. We can work with Microsoft. Looking back over the last few years, most of the time our collaboration has been open, productive and fair. They listened, we did too, and we developed some new interesting software. There is a precedent for fair competition. Let's make the most of that."/>
				<outline text="10. We also discussed identity in both venues: Passport and AOL's leaking Magic Carpet, Jabber, XNS, etc. I said let's do an API that flattens the differences between the services and &lt;i&gt;support them all.&lt;/i&gt; (Applying the inclusion philosophy, which applies to BigCo's as well as small ones.)"/>

			<outline text="Welcome to August">
				<outline text="Good afternoon one and all."/>
				<outline text="Twenty years ago, in August 1981, the first IBM PC rolled off the assembly line and said Hello World."/>
				<outline text="In response, Apple said &quot;Welcome IBM, seriously.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="And the rest of us got to work. "/>
				<outline text="Next Wednesday in San Jose, Microsoft and Intel are sponsoring a reunion and celebration. They asked each of us to write an essay with our remembrances of those great old days, and to say what we hope for the future."/>
				<outline text="Of course I wrote an essay for them. And here it is!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Big blank machine">
				<outline text="I was an author at Personal Software (makers of VisiCalc) in 1981, when we got our first PC. I didn't actually get to see or use the machine in that period, but I could tell something new was coming. There was a buzz around as the VisiCalc guys were porting from the Apple II to the new machine. After it came out I visited Mitch Kapor in Cambridge, and saw the vision for the machine it would become, through the fantastic spreadsheet that he and Jonathan Sachs were developing, Lotus 1-2-3."/>
				<outline text="In that same period I remember riding from the airport to Microsoft in Bellevue with Alan Boyd and asking if it was true that it really could go as high as 640K. He said it might even go higher. I was so excited!"/>
				<outline text="It wasn't until 1983 that I could afford to buy a PC. I was working on the Apple II, and totally confined by its 48K memory limit and 140K floppy drives. When I got my first PC it was a huge feeling of liberation. It wasn't even an XT, I had an external 10MB Corvus hard drive, 256K memory, and armed with Peter Norton's guide to the internal architecture and a code base that ported in two weeks. I felt supremely powerful. I told my friends I thought of it as a &quot;big blank machine,&quot; which is exactly how you get an ambitious young software developer excited. Show me the wide open spaces. The PC did that so well. "/>
				<outline text="The first PC was also much faster than the Apple II. And unlike the Apple III, it was reliable, and while it was difficult to configure for a hardware-averse person as myself, it was possible. The extra performance meant that code that had to be written in assembler on the Apple II could be written in a high-level language on the PC. "/>
				<outline text="The PC was the upgrade that Apple couldn't muster. I turned away and never looked back, until the PC hit its memory wall in 1986, and I switched to the Mac with its clean linear multi-megabyte address space and consistent graphic user interface, and never looked back."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="My father and the PC">
				<outline text="Now I want to tell you about a story of a father and a son."/>
				<outline text="My father was an IBMer in the sixties and seventies. He worked in Armonk, wore a suit, had a nice office, and did analysis of some kind. My dad is a thinker, which I think they liked at IBM because they had these great plastic signs that said simply THINK. I wish I had one of those signs right now."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, I was an Apple II developer in the late 70s, and my dad warned that it would never last. IBM is going to nuke them, is how I remember what my father said. I thought to myself &quot;Dad, you don't get it.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I had a good laugh until the IBM PC came out and swamped Apple. My dad gave me a huge I Told You So. I muttered under my breath that he &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; doesn't get it, even though I liked my PC much more than the Apple III it replaced. Then I loved my Compaq. Heh heh."/>
				<outline text="IBM's attitude, exemplified by my father, was the seed of their downfall. No doubt they believed that their blue suit attitude and THINK signs were the reasons the PC took off, when it was their open, clonable architecture combined with a very good solution to the problem of their chief competitor, that made the PC zoom. IBM needed the cloners as much as they needed IBM, they were the source of comfort for the customers, they provided the assurance that IBM couldn't try to lock the rest of us in the trunk and throw away the key."/>
				<outline text="When IBM tried to take control, we all went with the cloners, and then the Mac, and most recently the Internet. I remember reading about the layoffs at IBM in the early 90s and thinking of my dad, what would he say now. And I think of today's leaders of the PC industry, and how they're making the same mistakes that IBM made."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Hope for the future ">
				<outline text="Today I'm an Internet developer, writing server apps that run both in the cloud and on the desktop. I use a 1 Ghz Pentium III with Windows 2000, 512MB of memory, 70GB hard drive, DSL line. Many people in my company use Mac OS X, and we use Linux to serve Web content and run our email system. "/>
				<outline text="I like my machine very much, but I see the writing on the wall. Having captured the Web, much as IBM captured Apple, Microsoft is now moving to lock us into the trunk in new and improved ways. This is what passes for innovation these days. If you believe the logic of Microsoft there are no more big blank spaces for independent developers."/>
				<outline text="I've written several pieces about this, no need to repeat the story. I feel we have lost our roots, the PC was originally a revolutionary tool for individual empowerment. As we've gotten older and the industry has grown, we no longer value the individual expression that personal computer technology offers. We pay lip service to it, but our actions serve to thwart its purpose. We've gotten too large. We're repeating the mistakes of those who came before."/>
				<outline text="This means, to me, that our industry is ripe to have done to it what we did to the mainframe industry. We have a unique opportunity in history to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; stand in the way of change, rather to embrace it, and just let growth happen. To ignore the lesson of our own lives would be a tragedy."/>
				<outline text="Today as twenty years ago, I place the highest value on freedom. This spirit was perfectly embodied in the work of Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Lotus, Compaq, and thousands of independent developers, computer store owners, and press people. That was the PC community of 1981. "/>
				<outline text="We were young then, our companies were very small, we had nothing to lose, so we created something truly wonderful. This will happen again and again. If we're lucky, as individuals and companies, we can participate in each round of innovation, as long as we don't attempt to crush it or own it. That is the lesson of the PC."/>

			<outline text="Paired events">
				<outline text="A few weeks ago in San Diego I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/07/27/a10CabRideApart&quot;&gt;shuttled&lt;/a&gt; between two conferences that were like night and day but had a common thread and were only a $10 cab ride apart."/>
				<outline text="And then this week I went to two dinners, one in New York and one in San Jose. They were separated by a continent, but only one day in time. But in another sense the first was about the future, and the second was about the past, and so were separated by twenty years, in our minds."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dinner in San Jose last night">
				<outline text="Last night in San Jose we &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/07/27/a10CabRideApart&quot;&gt;celebrated&lt;/a&gt; the twentieth anniversary of the IBM PC which was released in August 1981. There were some great moments. Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Rod Canion, Mitch Kapor, David Bunnell, Ray Ozzie, Dave Bradley, and Dan Bricklin were on stage, explaining the significance of the PC and expressing their hope for the future."/>
				<outline text="My eyes, probably like many others, were on Gates. Attention focused as they talked about the rebellion in 1987 -- these were the rebels on stage, the Empire was IBM -- who, in 1987, said goodbye to Gates and Grove, went their own way, and thanks to the courage of Compaq, who had the guts to embrace the 386 and to tell IBM to stick it where the sun don't shine, we got an industry that works, at least through the mid-90s when Microsoft got wind of the Web, and quelled its own rebellion."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Notable omissions">
				<outline text="There were some notable omissions on last night's stage. Retailers were hugely important in the commercialization of the PC. I would have liked to have heard from Philippe Kahn and Peter Norton, and perhaps (for a twist) Steve Jobs. And of course it would have been nice to have an IBM exec present, but I understand they were invited but chose not to come. In all, it was satisfying, I got to see a lot of people I hadn't seen in many years, and others I don't see often enough, and it was nice to see that so many of us are still around and thinking about the next thing."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="From rebel to BigCo">
				<outline text="Last night Bill Gates talked about how they negotiated the right to license MS-DOS to other hardware vendors, and then I had a flash. We're in the same place in 2001, we can license the technology that pulls together SOAP networks much the same way Microsoft was able to build a network of PC cloners. Like IBM in 1987 -- they're huge and centralized, we're small and aggressive, so we can spread the love without so much money coming back. Now I know Microsoft can match us economically by dropping prices, but can they drop the ego and let developers drive the market? Either way I think we win. Think inclusive, zig to their zag. And remember that inclusion, as a philosophy, includes Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="Last night I sat with Dan Gillmor and John Markoff. As Bill talked about his plans, Gillmor wanted to know what we'll do about patents. The answer is we're going to have to deal with it. We can't let their patents stand in the way of independent software developers. In the old days we reminisced about last night, Microsoft used to beat the competition with better software that gave users more of what they want. Now they plan to use patents to to tax their competition, presumably without much concern for their financial viability. (Recall this is the &quot;cut off the air supply&quot; company.) We will have to take this story to the users, some of whom will value choice."/>
				<outline text="Last night we heard Gates tell stories about the days he used to write code himself, and we love him for this, truly, he put his ideas out there, at risk, when there was a possibility of competition, and they would lose sometimes to a better product. When Lotus came out with 1-2-3, it didn't just cream VisiCalc, it also wiped Multiplan. Of course they followed with Excel, an aptly named product, that won because it worked on the Mac, and took advantage of its unique features, as Lotus did with the PC, and was clearly more useful than its predecessor."/>
				<outline text="Now Gates wants to win by shutting down competition before it has a chance to start. From the inside of his wall it must look pretty secure, much as it must have looked inside the IBM in the early-mid 1980s."/>
				<outline text="Round and round we go. ;-&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dinner on Monday in NY">
				<outline text="New York is The Big Apple, it's where I started writing many many years ago. We had a great dinner in NY on August 6, and some people asked &quot;When are you coming back?&quot; and I said &quot;You don't have to wait for me to come back.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="So today I started a mail list for New Yorkers who read DaveNet and Scripting News."/>
				<outline text="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scriptingNewsNewYork"/>
				<outline text="What was different about our group on Monday is that it was mostly developers, not the marketing people with their business models, but people grounded in ones and zeros, and who have an idea of what users want because they are also users. This is the magic formula, geeks who use; that's where good products come from."/>
				<outline text="So let's see if we can get some new tech stuff happening in NY, not the make-believe tech stuff of the last few years, but the real kind. We've got lots of resources, lots of geeks, and a few marketing people (yes, we still need you). I'll get the word around that the list started, and let the NYers take it from there. I'm behind you all the way. Let's Go New York!"/>

				<outline text="Blogger is a browser-based tool for editing a news oriented weblog site, or &quot;blog,&quot; as they call them in Blogger-Land. We're competitors, so sometimes they cause me grief that only a competitor can. I once said on Scripting News &quot;Blogger Blogger Blogger. If you say Blogger one more time I'll blog all over you.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="But hey they make a great product, the press loves them, and they are very successful. In the dotcom downturn it's one of a handful of services that's growing by leaps and bounds while the headlines say everything is collapsing. "/>
				<outline text="But Blogger is tiny, it's just one person, Evan Williams, who's writing the software, keeping the servers running, and supporting hundreds of thousands of users. At the same time, Williams has created a little revolution, by creating one of the most intriguing Web services ever."/>
				<outline text="http://plant.blogger.com/api/"/>
				<outline text="What is that? "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Internet is a writing environment">
				<outline text="I'd say that the Internet is 25 percent cash register and 75 percent writing environment."/>
				<outline text="If you adopt the writing environment view as both Blogger and UserLand do, it's easy to see how Web services make a difference, they allow desktop apps to connect to the cloud."/>
				<outline text="With the new functionality that Blogger has developed, you can now use our writing and design tools to create for a Blogger website. It's done through an open and documented XML-RPC interface, so it will be possible for tools on &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; platform to hook into Blogger."/>
				<outline text="What makes Blogger unique is that it's quickly driving developer and user adoption of XML-RPC. It's as close to a killer app as we're likely to get. There's already Python, Perl, COM and Frontier glue that connects with Blogger. There will be all kinds of connections. "/>
				<outline text="Open interfaces, and developer and user choice. This is what the Internet makes possible. Right on."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="LittleCo's">
				<outline text="It's even better because we LittleCo's did it for ourselves. It works great on Windows, Mac OS or Linux with no trap doors or locked trunks. Evan is using the Helma XML-RPC &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.helma.org/&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; for Java. How about that, we got Java talking to Frontier in a meaningful way. It took a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/98/01/stories/emailWithBillJoyAtSun.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, but what the heck."/>
				<outline text="On the other hand, since XML-RPC crosses all OSes, licenses and cultures, the Blogger interface is inclusive, because commercial developers, consultants, VARs, in-house programmers, and open source developers can all work cooperatively, side by side, in open and fair competition."/>
				<outline text="My friends this is a blueprint for how the outside-Microsoft developer community of the future, one that includes IBM, The Apache Foundation, Bare Bones, Adobe, AOL, Macromedia, BEA, Richard Stallman and anyone else, will work in the future. If you've been thinking that the software industry is headed for more stagnation, study this development model, it works, and it's revolutionary and simple. Everyone is invited. No exceptions."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Perspective">
				<outline text="We've been at this for a long time."/>
				<outline text="In 1988 we developed an interapplication communication toolkit for the Macintosh, followed by a script development and runtime environment centered around the architecture. Then over a few years, the major Macintosh apps wired up, and power users were able to write scripts that viewed apps as toolkits, combining them as they see fit, in ways that their developers didn't envision. Then each app developed a community of users who cultivated the features that we put into the scripting environment and groomed the wires provided by the app developers so they would work better for future scripters. We ported to Windows, which is the other major end-user operating system, but by then we were already Internet developers, so we invested in XML-RPC and SOAP, and now are moving again to create cultures at the intersections."/>
				<outline text="In perspective, Blogger now takes its place alongside Quark XPress, FileMaker, PageMaker, Eudora, Netscape, MSIE, StuffIt, and all kinds of other scriptable apps. They all interface the same way to a UserLand script writer. The glue scripts for Blogger contain &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/xml/rpc&quot;&gt;xml.rpc&lt;/a&gt; calls instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/basic/appleEvent&quot;&gt;appleEvent&lt;/a&gt; calls. To the script writer, an app is accessed in the same way, whether it's on a local machine, or is a Web service over the Internet. "/>
				<outline text="We work with competitors to empower users and other developers, and make it easy for users who want to, to become developers. That's the philosophy of the Internet, and it's always been the philosophy of serious developers, even those who work at BigCo's. Sometimes leadership makes us take the low road, through patents or other lock-in strategies, but imho that's when they are leading through fear, not power. It's always right to be compatible, and it's even better to plan for it, to design for it, commit to it."/>
				<outline text="So thank you to Blogger for having the courage to be one of the first to open its Web app to scripting through open interfaces. A bright future awaits us. I'm sure of it."/>

			<outline text="Introduction by Dave Winer">
				<outline text="In April I received an invitation from Wall Street Journal reporter David Bank to review his upcoming book about Microsoft, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simonsays.com/book/default_book.cfm?isbn=0743203151&quot;&gt;Breaking Windows&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; and of course I said yes. I consume those kinds of books as part of a steady diet of computer-related literature. "/>
				<outline text="Books in this genre can be exhausting, often portraying the leaders of Microsoft as inhuman heroes and geniuses; but Bank's book is different, more real, because he tapped into a huge collection of emails from Microsoft executives that were made public during the antitrust trial. That gave &lt;i&gt;Breaking Windows&lt;/i&gt; a grounding that no previous Microsoft treatise had. For the first time the humanity and confusion comes out, in a sympathetic way, in the exact words of Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Jim Allchin, Brad Silverberg, Brad Chase, David Cole, Ben Slivka, Adam Bosworth and many others. You can see how events outside Microsoft were shaped by people at the top levels of the company, in their own words."/>
				<outline text="Microsoft has long appeared to be a well-oiled machine, moving in lock-step towards goals set by Bill Gates. In &lt;i&gt;Breaking Windows,&lt;/i&gt; however, a different picture emerges. The agony inside and around Microsoft is the theme of Bank's fantastic book. I believe it's the most illuminating and important book you can read in 2001 if you're part of the computer, software or Internet industry."/>
				<outline text="I asked for permission to run an excerpt, and the publisher, The Free Press, graciously agreed. This section, pages 113-122, is crucial to the story. In this excerpt Bank tells the story of Microsoft's decision to comply with a judge's order to open up Windows to other browsers by breaking Windows, an act of self-defacement that illustrates how far Microsoft will go before bending to authority. I was at Microsoft the day this happened, and remember discussing it with people there. A line was crossed for many of us in this event, and as you will see, the line went through the top levels of Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="I've included pointers to further reading and a discussion group for the book at the &lt;a href=&quot;#pointers&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; of the piece. Now here's the excerpt from Breaking Windows by David Bank."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Excerpt from Breaking Windows, by David Bank">
				<outline text="Gates's triumphant visit to China was interrupted by a call from Microsoft's in-house antitrust lawyer, David Heiner. The news: U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had sided with the government and ordered Microsoft to stop tying its Internet Explorer browser to Windows. At a news conference in China, Gates declined to comment on the case. He hurried home. "/>
				<outline text="To Microsoft executives, the implications of the order were as foggy as the Seattle weather that Thursday afternoon in December 1997. The good news was that Jackson denied the government's request for a contempt citation. The consent decree and Microsoft's behavior, he said, were both too ambiguous to support such a ruling. "/>
				<outline text="However, on his own, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/dictionary/dictionary_alpha.cfm?wordnumber=723&amp;alpha=S&quot;&gt;sua sponte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, Jackson moved to enforce the 1995 consent decree Microsoft had negotiated with the Justice Department and European antitrust authorities. At issue was the section of the decree barring Microsoft from forcing PC makers to take an &quot;other product&quot;-in this case, the browser-as a condition of licensing Windows. For monopolies, this kind of &quot;tying&quot; is a no-no. It is considered inherently anticompetitive. If customers genuinely wanted the other product, there would be no need to force them; if they didn't want it, they shouldn't be forced to take it in order to get the product they need. "/>
				<outline text="Any ambiguity came from a proviso that had been negotiated into the 1995 consent decree almost as an afterthought. Now the proviso became the heart of the matter. The consent decree's anti-tying clause, the proviso clarified, &quot;shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products.&quot; The loophole appeared to give Microsoft an out. "/>
				<outline text="It was Gates himself who had insisted on the loophole in late-night negotiations in 1994 with Joel Klein's predecessor as Clinton's  antitrust chief, Anne Bingaman. In the talks, Microsoft's attorneys at first suggested a more limited proviso to the anti-tying clause: Microsoft would not be prohibited from developing integrated products &quot;which offer technological advantages.&quot; But that restriction was unacceptable to Gates, who refused to give bureaucrats the authority to decide whether changes to Windows delivered such advantages; he directed his lawyers to remove the last four words. Gates was emphatic that Microsoft would not accept any limitations on its rights to design its products as it saw fit. Microsoft signed the consent decree, its lawyers said, only after ensuring its &quot;unfettered right to incorporate new features into its operating systems,&quot; according to a declaration by Microsoft's outside counsel, Richard Urowsky of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. "/>
				<outline text="At the last minute, negotiators agreed to drop another phrase from the proviso. The original wording of the phrase was &quot;. . . shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products nor necessarily permit it to do so.&quot; The negotiators later explained their thinking: They were simply deferring any definition of &quot;integrated&quot; to a later day, not rewriting antitrust law. Yet, as it stood, Gates apparently believed he had outfoxed the government. "/>
				<outline text="Throughout the summer and fall of 1997, Microsoft's attorneys insisted in a series of meetings with Justice Department attorneys that the &quot;integrated products&quot; proviso gave Microsoft a free pass to add Internet Explorer to Windows. The government was welcome to try its luck with a full-blown Sherman Act antitrust case, they said. But with the language of the proviso, Klein might as well give up any thought of a quick victory with a narrow case under the consent decree, Microsoft's lawyers said. &quot;Don't waste your time on the consent decree. Look at the language,&quot; Bill Neukom, Microsoft's dapper general counsel, told Klein's lawyers. "/>
				<outline text="To Microsoft, the proviso blessed the company's right to add any features it chose to its operating system, just as the company had been doing for sixteen years. Microsoft defined &quot;integrated&quot; the way Webster's Third New International Dictionary defined it-&quot;combined,&quot; &quot;united,&quot; or &quot;incorporated into.&quot; Under the company's definition, a product is integrated simply because Microsoft says it is. In discussions with the government, Microsoft's attorneys famously argued, were it not for a lack of marketplace demand, the company was free to bundle a ham sandwich into Windows. "/>
				<outline text="Now Microsoft's confidence was shaken by a federal court judge. &quot;Microsoft's 'unfettered liberty' to impose its idea of what has been 'integrated' into its operating systems stops at least at the point at which it would violate established antitrust law,&quot; Jackson wrote. To enforce the point, he issued a preliminary injunction ordering Microsoft to drop its requirement that PC makers preinstall Microsoft's Internet browser as a condition of licensing Windows. Even more alarming, the judge's order covered successors to Windows 95. It was the first time Windows 98 had been formally dragged into the company's antitrust troubles. Microsoft had even grander plans for using the market power of Windows 98 to boost Internet Explorer. "/>
				<outline text="Nobody had thought it would go that far. &quot;His last paragraph there was very broad and sweeping, which stunned us,&quot; Allchin recalled. Maritz said, &quot;There were a lot of things in there that I personally found confusing.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="The company's high command faced a long weekend of work. Neukom was nominally in charge of the company's legal strategy. But it was David Heiner who was the workhorse, serving as project manager for dealing with the Justice Department and as referee for Microsoft's loud and fast-talking executives. Heiner took over the boardroom across the hall from Gates's office in Building 8 and turned it into the war room for gathering input and plotting strategy. "/>
				<outline text="For those who gathered in the boardroom, the legal discussion was a test of their ability to compartmentalize, a highly prized and necessary skill at Microsoft. The technology tug-of-war between Allchin and Silverberg and the legal imbroglio with the government were running in parallel. The two fronts involved the same set of issues: the relationship of the new phase of technology evolution, centered on the Internet, with the old phase, centered around Windows. Throughout the fall, many of the same people-Maritz, Allchin, Chase, Cole, and of course Gates-were deeply involved in both sets of discussions. Silverberg, who remained officially on leave, was absent from the legal discussions. "/>
				<outline text="The group pored over the ruling. In Gates's absence, Steve Ballmer peppered Heiner with dozens of questions. There were procedural problems with Jackson's orders, the lawyers explained. When Jackson threw out the contempt claim, that should have been the end of it. But Jackson had moved on his own to issue a preliminary injunction. And he had appointed a &quot;special master,&quot; a law professor from Harvard named Lawrence Lessig, to help sort out the issues in what might well turn into a mini-trial of its own, possibly leading to permanent remedies. Lessig was beginning to make a name for himself applying constitutional principles to cyberspace policy disputes. He looked like bad news to Microsoft. "/>
				<outline text="But all that could be taken up later. The preliminary injunction demanded an immediate response. The group quickly dispatched with the implications for Windows 98 by deciding to ignore them. There was plenty of time to challenge them in the six months or so before the expected release of the new operating system. &quot;We had a discussion that said we specifically weren't going to think about this,&quot; Allchin later told government lawyers. &quot;We're not thinking about it. March on. In our business we could disrupt a lot of people for nothing in a situation where time is slipping away on us.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="It was not as easy to dismiss the implications for Windows 95. The group considered a number of ways to easily deactivate Internet Explorer. Microsoft's own Web sites boasted that &quot;IE uninstalls easily.&quot; Perhaps Microsoft could offer PC makers a version of Windows 95 with the Internet Explorer icon removed from the desktop and other program menus. Or it could let PC makers use Windows' own &quot;uninstall&quot; program to remove the browser in the same way a customer might. That, after all, was what the PC makers were seeking from the beginning. "/>
				<outline text="Ballmer's first instinct was to strike a pose of humility and try to avoid direct confrontation with the government. Chase, too, favored taking the high road in the hopes of gradually winning over the company's adversaries with charm and what he was sure were the merits of Microsoft's arguments. Justice Department officials were saying they expected to meet with Microsoft's lawyers within a few days to agree on an approach to satisfy the order. Something could be worked out. "/>
				<outline text="It was spin-control time. The company's first response was striking in its moderation. A Microsoft flak, Adam Sohn, a damage-control veteran from the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, spread good news to reporters. &quot;We think it's a pretty balanced decision and we're grateful,&quot; he said. "/>
				<outline text="Microsoft's press release also accentuated the positive. The company was &quot;gratified&quot; Jackson did not find the company in contempt. It was &quot;looking forward&quot; to presenting more evidence. It was &quot;confident&quot; it would prevail. The press release dismissed as a minor issue the order that Microsoft offer a browser-free Windows. Microsoft could continue to license Windows 95, the release stressed, as long as each PC maker &quot;has the option of installing the portion of Windows 95 that does not include Internet Explorer 3.0 or 4.0 files.&quot; Over the weekend, one Microsoft spokesman told the Wall Street Journal the company expected to find ways to let PC makers delete Internet Explorer 3.0 and 4.0 files and still allow Windows to function. "/>
				<outline text="When Gates returned from China, he turned the group around and changed the conciliatory tone. To him, a milquetoast response put Microsoft on the slippery slope to bankruptcy. The government's suit was an attack on the company's ability to add features in Windows. Integration was not only a fundamental principle, it was the basic business strategy Microsoft had pursued since it licensed its first operating system sixteen years earlier. If PC makers could pick and choose which parts of Windows to offer and what features to promote on the desktop screen, they could cut deals with Microsoft's competitors to gradually displace Windows. "/>
				<outline text="That was why he had pushed so hard in the negotiations over the 1995 consent decree to secure the exception for integrated products in the first place. Now it was time to take advantage of his foresight. "/>
				<outline text="At stake were all the company's plans for Windows Everywhere. It wasn't only about the browser war, where the momentum had shifted in Microsoft's favor such that the company could probably afford to let PC makers delete the Internet Explorer icon, or even the browser itself, without significant harm. But what about the Windows media player, which competed with the streaming video player from Real Networks? Or voice recognition, where IBM was strong? Or some other technology in the future? &quot;Their position is that every major thing we've done, every major thing we're planning to do, should be blocked,&quot; Gates said later. "/>
				<outline text="Gates considered the alternatives. At the end of his sixteen-page memorandum, Jackson's one-paragraph order was vague on exactly what Microsoft was required to do. All it said was that Microsoft must stop its practice of licensing Windows on the condition PC makers also license and install &quot;any Microsoft Internet browser software.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Jackson, in his longer memorandum, though not in the order itself, referred to the &quot;software code that Microsoft itself now separately distributes at retail as Internet Explorer 3.0.&quot; Government prosecutors also referred to the retail product in their request for action. The government's imprecision in defining exactly what it meant by &quot;browser&quot; was to be a recurring issue in the case. David Cole had submitted an affidavit attesting to the fact that IE 3 and Windows 95 shared a number of files needed by the operating system even to boot up, or start, properly. Removing all of the IE 3 files would &quot;break&quot; Windows, he had said. "/>
				<outline text="Gates wanted to know what would happen if Microsoft adopted the most extreme, hyperliteral reading of the order? What if the company were to comply with Jackson's order by offering PC makers a version of Windows stripped of every line of code that also appeared in Internet Explorer? PC makers would have the option of installing a broken version of Windows 95, free of Internet Explorer. Microsoft could comply with the letter of the order and demonstrate the absurdity of the government's position at the same time. "/>
				<outline text="Gates, a lawyer's son, was ferocious in legal debates. Microsoft's attorneys needed all their self-confidence and legal experience in order to keep up with his ability to instantly understand and apply the  law. Microsoft's internal discussions are typically fast, loud, and &quot;high-bandwidth&quot;-a phrase borrowed from telecommunications conveying high praise for the volume of information that could be exchanged rapidly. "/>
				<outline text="The pedantic, formal style of Richard Urowsky, Microsoft's outside counsel, couldn't be more different, but Gates had immense respect for his legal abilities. In the boardroom, Urowsky's ponderous voice came over the speakerphone from Washington, D.C. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;Bill.&quot; There was a long pause. &quot;Bill.&quot; Another pause. &quot;This is Richard.&quot; Urowsky's trademark interruption was one of the few ways to slow one of Gates's hundred-mile-per-hour rants. The ploy worked marvelously, shutting Gates up and making him smile at the same time. "/>
				<outline text="Microsoft's lawyers agreed that under the strictest possible interpretation of Jackson's ruling, Microsoft could argue that it was required to offer a version of Windows stripped of any of the code also used in the retail version of IE 3.0. Microsoft could argue that the simplest method of &quot;removing&quot; IE was barred under the injunction-simply letting PC makers remove the IE icon, or use the &quot;uninstall&quot; feature, because both of those methods left much of the underlying code in place. If the goal of Microsoft's defense was to protect the principle that Microsoft can integrate new functionality into Windows, why offer alternatives that might not comply with the judge's order but could put fetters on Microsoft's unfettered ability to integrate? "/>
				<outline text="The group also was aware that giving PC makers a choice between the status quo and a commercially worthless product might not have been what Judge Jackson quite had in mind. It was never a good idea to anger a federal judge. "/>
				<outline text="The proposal sat on the boardroom table, like a bomb ready to  go off. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;We're going to look terrible. We're going to look terrible. We're going to look terrible,&quot; warned some people in the room, Ballmer told me later. &quot;I'm in the group of people who understood, we're not going to look good.&quot; Ballmer was still recovering from the fallout that followed his &quot;To heck with Janet Reno!&quot; outburst at a Microsoft sales event a month earlier. Microsoft could take a hard line and make its point, but Ballmer wanted to know, What is the outcome? What is the collateral damage? Ballmer acknowledged, &quot;We agonized over that, looking bad.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Indeed, the Broken Windows approach was far from the most commonsense interpretation of the order. The injunction was simply a cease-and-desist order, a holding action until the court could make  a final determination about whether Internet Explorer was a sepa- rate product and thus covered by the decree. The most thoughtful analysis of the whole mess came from Lessig, the brainy Harvard law professor. Before Lessig's appointment as Jackson's special master was rescinded by the appeals court on technical grounds, he offered his preliminary opinion in an eleven-page letter to lawyers on both sides. "/>
				<outline text="Lessig found that the terms of the original decree were the real guide to what was and was not allowed; Jackson's injunction was simply meant to enforce the decree. And the plain meaning of the consent decree was to give PC makers a &quot;zone of sovereignty&quot; from Microsoft, protection for their freedom to choose competing products. Thus, Microsoft could have met the zone of sovereignty test, Lessig wrote, by lifting the provisions that restricted the freedom of PC makers to remove or disable the code that enabled the browser's functions. &quot;If Microsoft simply said, with respect to IE, 'You are free,' Microsoft would be in compliance.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="In contrast, Microsoft's all-or-nothing stance did nothing to set PC makers free. Microsoft interpreted the injunction that PC makers couldn't be forced to take all of Internet Explorer as meaning they couldn't take any of it, even the parts required to make Windows work. The requirement that PC makers either take the full Internet Explorer/Windows 95 bundle or remove every last bit of code didn't leave PC makers &quot;free to choose about the package of products they will offer to customers,&quot; the plain meaning of the consent decree, Lessig wrote. "/>
				<outline text="Setting PC makers free was the last thing Microsoft wanted to do. The &quot;IBM-compatible&quot; PC industry grew up around Microsoft's central role in defining the operating system platform; Microsoft treated PC makers less as partners and more as mere distributors for Windows. Now the PC makers wanted to rebalance the relationships with Microsoft, promote their brands as unique, and take advantage of their relationships with customers to expand their razor-thin profit margins. Microsoft would become just one of several parts suppliers for their PCs. "/>
				<outline text="From Microsoft's perspective, any new relationship that let PC makers go their own way would weaken Microsoft's hold on software developers, who wrote programs for Windows because it was installed so widely. &quot;The minute we give up the contractual hooks, we fragment the platform and we lose the value of the unified platform,&quot; Raikes, then the number-two sales executive, told me later. "/>
				<outline text="Maybe there was room for compromise. As the weekend wore on, Maritz and others jumped in, favoring moderation. Maybe hard core wasn't the right approach in this situation, they said. This is a federal judge, not a software competitor. Things could get worse, a lot worse. At a minimum, the company was looking at three months of disastrous PR. Can't we just get this over with? some executives pleaded. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;It was an incredibly awkward, no-win situation,&quot; remembers Chase."/>
				<outline text="Gates continued to argue for the high-risk, high-reward response. If Windows and IE were &quot;integrated,&quot; they were home free. To him, there was no better way to prove Windows is an integrated product than to show that it broke when Internet Explorer was removed. &quot;We have to maintain the absolute right to design software as we see fit,&quot; he argued. This was a great way to slam home that point. "/>
				<outline text="Gates's proposal drew supporters, including Allchin. Ballmer insisted later that Gates's viewpoint was not &quot;substantively different&quot; than that of the rest of the group. Nobody argued that the Broken Windows approach wasn't risky. Everybody knew the company would certainly take a public relations hit. "/>
				<outline text="Still, Gates said, &quot;I want to go for this.&quot; The clincher in his argument: If Microsoft followed the letter of the ruling, it would help its case on appeal. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;We all agreed with Bill and braced ourselves for the fallout,&quot; said one participant. "/>
				<outline text="On Monday morning, Microsoft offered the stripped-down version of Windows. To soften its stance, the company also agreed to make available a two-year-old version of Windows 95 that was released at retail before Internet Explorer was added to the product. PC makers would not be given any new flexibility to use the more commonplace methods to remove the browser functions or the icon. "/>
				<outline text="The fallout was immediate. Dan Gillmor, in his column in the San Jose Mercury News, called it &quot;compliance with a raised middle finger.&quot; The Justice Department claimed the response made an &quot;absolute mockery&quot; of the preliminary injunction and went back to court to again seek a contempt citation. Microsoft employees visiting home for the holidays were suddenly forced to defend the integrity of what had long been one of the country's most respected companies. &quot;It's very painful when you go home and your son asks, 'Daddy, why is the government suing Microsoft?' &quot; said Anthony Bay, one of the middle managers who had attended the Power Lab workshop. "/>
				<outline text="Ballmer acknowledged the damage. &quot;It left us in a position where a lot of people are questioning our company, whether it's a moral company, a proper company, respectful company,&quot; he told me. The negative feeling from customers and others in the industry was clear &quot;and has certainly not been lost on any of us,&quot; he said. The company convened focus groups and found a noticeable negative turn. &quot;The number of people enthusiastic about the company, the products, who would recommend, or would buy them, has clearly taken a dip. It's not cataclysmic. But it's clear.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="The response also damaged Microsoft's credibility with Judge Jackson. He had ordered Microsoft only to &quot;cease and desist&quot; from the company's own practice. He hadn't prescribed the particulars of the new licensing terms the company should adopt. He later said he considered Microsoft's response so &quot;untrustworthy&quot; it colored his view of the company for the next two years. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;I found their compliance to be less than genuine,&quot; he said."/>
				<outline text="Cole was deployed to receive Jackson's wrath. In court a few weeks later, Jackson asked incredulously, &quot;It seemed absolutely clear to you that I entered an order that required you distribute a product that would not work? Is that what you're telling me?&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Cole was a good soldier. &quot;In plain English, yes,&quot; Cole told Jackson. &quot;We followed that order. It wasn't my place to consider the consequences of that.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Gates insisted that he had had no choice but to remove every line of code that also appeared in the retail version of the browser. And the court of appeals later found that Microsoft's interpretation was indeed plausible. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;We did exactly what the order said to do. There was no freedom or flexibility,&quot; Gates said at a public event a month after the episode. &quot;What did people say about that? How were we treated on that? Brutally, just brutally.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="&quot;I was not sitting there going, 'Ha, ha, I'll do what I want.' I was sitting there going, 'This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me. When can I get back to just focusing on developing software?' And then to have the press come out and say, you know, what it said, that felt bad.&quot; "/>

				<outline text="An interesting discussion has started on the Breaking-Windows mail list. "/>
				<outline text="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/breaking-windows"/>
				<outline text="A ex-softie, Adam Barr, author of another inside-Microsoft book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proudlyserving.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, (what a name for a book) has been (proudly?) repping the Microsoft party line. I've recused myself from the argument because I have a new philosophy about discourse with Microsoft."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No more arguing">
				<outline text="In June while the Smart Tags power-grab looked real, I made a decision to stop arguing with Microsoft people. If they had more facts to add to the discussion, great, but I stopped trying to convince them that what they were doing was unfair, or unbecoming a company of their stature, or hurtful to developers, or whatever. It's a game I was too willing to play in the past. "/>
				<outline text="I go back over my writing in late 1997 and early 1998 and see that the hopes I had for Microsoft were unjustified. I wished they would become an excellent corporate citizen, and really act on their words of respect for developers. Now I see it differently. "/>
				<outline text="Considering all that, let's get real about what's been going on in the last few years in DeveloperLand. Java, to developers, was a possible emancipation from Microsoft, but Sun turned out to be no better. Open source was the next insurrection, and even though it was tainted by the dotcom lunacy, that's over now, and open source is still here, and actually so is Java. In fact, one of the explanations for Microsoft's 18-month vapor trail called .Net is that it's trying to put a damper on the growth of Java, and, come to think of it, their recent interest in open source probably has a similar goal. "/>
				<outline text="While there are huge waves of Microsoft-inspired confusion wafting through the software world now, there is a simple idea that is evading all their competitors. To neutralize half of the oomph of the Microsoft threat, wire up your apps through SOAP and XML-RPC and claim that you beat Microsoft to market. You will be very justified in that claim. If a hundred platforms rush on board quickly, the analysts and reporters might sing a different tune about who's dominating whom."/>
				<outline text="The other half of the oomph is the monopoly Microsoft has in desktop operating systems and Web browsers. For that we have to turn to the courts for help, and it'll be a total mess if they don't impose some real restraints on Microsoft. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Java and .Net">
				<outline text="OK, put Java and .Net in a box. "/>
				<outline text="They're going to duke it out."/>
				<outline text="Assume that eventually Sun will figure out that to make Java stronger against .Net they have to build in SOAP interfaces and make sure people don't miss them. Then Java will have a maturity advantage over .Net. "/>
				<outline text="Also since Sun isn't trying to be all things to all people, they'll be able to continue the partnerships they already have. On the other hand, Microsoft being who they are, will be able to force themselves into places they weren't before, turning users and developers into OEMs, distributors of Microsoft technology who must upgrade at every turn, with slimmer opportunities to create and use new stuff that doesn't come from Microsoft. Most of the interesting high ground in .Net is Microsoft's, there's not much room for anyone else, and starting with Windows XP, they have the right to upgrade the platform at will (a good reason to stick with Windows 2000, imho)."/>
				<outline text="When Microsoft and Sun think about developers, they are thinking about people who can &quot;add value&quot; to their platform. None of their co-investors, if they don't like the way the platform is going, can take it in a different direction. No matter what the corporate masters have the last word."/>
				<outline text="I think of developers in a different way. On the Windows platform, a developer is someone who could write a spreadsheet that's better than Excel and win in competition with Microsoft based on the merits of the software. Those are the kinds of developers I like to work with, ones who can create ground-breaking products that win."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Apache">
				<outline text="Now consider Apache, which hasn't got the depth of Java or .Net, but does have a considerable amount of developer momentum. Why? Because it doesn't just talk about developer freedom, it guarantees it. "/>
				<outline text="If I were to become an Apache developer, I know that if I want to compete with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/foundation/&quot;&gt;The Apache Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, no matter how powerful they get, I can do it. Of course I may never have to use this power, but in case I do, it's nice to know it's there. This safety for developers is a key feature for a platform, and it's why Apache is doing so well, while Microsoft is losing developers to Java and open source. Apache offers something Microsoft and Sun don't, developer freedom."/>
				<outline text="Here's an example of why this is important to the health of a platform. In the mid-90s while Apple was fighting against the Web, yet enjoying a huge market share among Web users, a group of Mac developers including Microsoft wanted Apple to fully embrace the Web, but Apple didn't move. With the benefit of hindsight I think it's clear that the Mac would be more dug in today had we had our freedom, if our ideas had had a chance, and that today's Apple would be better off as well. We wasted a lot of time and money trying to make the Mac platform a winner on the Web. Had our platform been open, I believe the effort wouldn't have gone to waste."/>
				<outline text="Now Microsoft has &quot;shared&quot; source with a patent whammy; and Sun has a community program that they control; therefore I'm at the point where I think I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that neither Microsoft or Sun will be dominant as we go forward, and am willing to make my bet. As a platform for independent developers neither of the BigCo's half-hearted attempts to offer developers freedom is convincing. The Apache philosophy is the right one for me."/>
				<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
				<outline text="PS: Re Microsoft's &quot;patent whammy&quot; -- this came out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2001/08/09/oscon_panel.html&quot;&gt;discussion portion&lt;/a&gt; of the Craig Mundie debate at O'Reilly's open source convention in July. Basically Microsoft can release the source code to their operating system, under very restrictive terms, because they believe they will be granted patents on key techniques used in the software. "/>
				<outline text="PPS: We've done a fair amount of research into open source licenses and philosophies. Briefly, the GPL is not for us because it does not include a clear disclaimer of power on the part of the licensee. The Apache license is a free grant of technology, with the IP constraints where they belong, on trademarks. Interestingly, this is something every developer must have an opinion about these days, whether or not they manage or participate in open source projects."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;An Epitaph for Be&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/16/01; 7:46:37 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="What a great network we have. At 6:30AM Pacific I got an email from a reader with a copy of a press release saying that Be had been acquired by Palm. I went to the PR Newswire website, found the press release and linked to it. I went to other news sites to see what they had -- there was nothing. "/>
				<outline text="This column is a little slower than the website because it goes through email; so I assume by now that you've heard that the assets and key personnel of Be, Inc. have been acquired by Palm Computing, for $11 million in stock. I'm gathering pointers to story about this event, on Scripting News &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/08/16#bePointers&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;."/>
				<outline text="Expect some passionate writing -- this company evoked our better nature. They gave us a little guy to root for, even though many believed they were doomed. Expect some interesting writing as the day goes by. "/>
				<outline text="And of course, I'd like to do my part. ;-&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="An epitaph for Be">
				<outline text="Be almost got it right."/>
				<outline text="While they were struggling to gain traction; and then to be acquired, I was reluctant to say publicly what went wrong at Be, why their platform didn't gain enough traction with developers to make a difference. This topic, how to create a successful platform, has been much on my mind through this summer, and will continue to be, probably through the end of the year and beyond."/>
				<outline text="Be's failure to gather developer support wasn't caused by lack of interest on the part of developers. Be was a carefully watched and much admired platform. It wasn't open source, and it's possible that if it were, that might have saved them, but I don't think that was the root cause for its failure with developers."/>
				<outline text="Here's the reason. Jean-Louis Gassee learned too much from his experience at Apple. In the late 80s when he was Apple's chief product exec, Apple was paying huge license fees to Adobe for the Postscript interpreter that was baked into the ROM of each LaserWriter printer. I heard estimates of $1000 per printer, going straight to Adobe. From this, Gassee incorrectly concluded that it wasn't safe to let developers have control of a strategic part of their technology. This meant that Be had to go alone into the market. When Jean-Louis promoted his platform to developers, it was always with a suspicious eye, trying to avoid another experience like the one Apple had with Adobe. When he promoted it to the public, he had little to sell beyond what was developed internally at Be. The platform never got the boost that developers can provide."/>
				<outline text="We had quite a few discussions about UserLand developing for his platform, dating back to the founding of both our companies in 1988. He was on the Board of Directors of my company. Were confidants back in those days but sometimes I felt like I was his therapist, constantly reminding him that &quot;I am not John Warnock&quot; but somehow I don't think it sunk in."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/08/15/apache&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about what platform vendors must do to earn the trust of developers, and today the issue is flipped around -- how can we make it safe for platform vendors? Is there a way to create a platform in 2001 that returns value to its shareholders and at the same time creates a safe environment for developers? Both things must happen in order for a platform to gain and hold traction, imho."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why it worked">
				<outline text="To the extent that Be worked, I believe it is because JLG gives great developer conference."/>
				<outline text="In 1995, I had given up Be as a goner when I got news from the Agenda conference. Everyone was excited about Be. &quot;Amazing,&quot; I said. &quot;And I know why.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Be didn't have a credible strategy in 1995, but most of the people at Agenda had never seen a Jean-Louis stage show. He's the best there is -- he &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; that he's a pimp, not a whore. (Those are his words, sexual metaphors are deeply and justifiably ingrained in the JLG developer philosophy.) "/>
				<outline text="Jean-Louis talked to the bankers, entrepreneurs and reporters at Agenda as if they were developers, and they loved him, which comes as no surprise to me. He is the best harvester of love I've ever seen."/>
				<outline text="Someday, if I'm lucky, I will get to do a developer conference myself, and if that day comes, my role model will be Jean-Louis."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Fast-forward to 2001">
				<outline text="OK, maybe Be, under its new ownership will take a chance and release the source code for the operating system under the Apache license. This would be a good move. They only paid $11 million for the company, and the key asset of the company hasn't done very well without an open source license. Perhaps it's time to try the other method."/>
				<outline text="Regardless, the leading edge is not at the device-driver and GUI level in 2001. Maybe it will be again in 2005 if we're successful at creating diversity in the layer that's being developed now, network services for desktop apps. "/>

				<outline text="My summer hiatus is coming to a close, I've been goofing off a bit, doing a little work, and writing a bunch on the Web. Now I want to get the conversation started in DaveNet, so I'm going to pick up a few threads from Scripting News and run them out through email."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Movies">
				<outline text="On Monday night I watched a poorly executed movie with an incredible cast and an even better plot. I watched it twice just to revel in its mediocrity. "/>
				<outline text="In movies it's not such a big deal. You waste three hours and even then you feel good. In software we waste years, sometimes decades, on poorly executed movies with decent plots. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Windows XP launching">
				<outline text="Microsoft reached a milestone in the shipment of Windows XP -- a golden master disk was delivered to their OEMs, but I wonder if the OS will ship because the antitrust process is also moving forward, and this release presses a lot of antitrust buttons."/>
				<outline text="With XP, Microsoft has reached the end of the evolution of the twenty-year-old MS-DOS codebase. This is good news because XP, unlike Windows 3.0, 95, 98 and ME, is not a crashy &quot;consumer&quot; OS. This is a major user benefit that so far Microsoft has been reluctant to promote. They should get over it and tell people that the blue screen of death is now part of the past for PC users, much as the C prompt faded away in 1990."/>
				<outline text="This OS release is also notable in that it does not contain Java, and it does hook into Passport, which is good news if you like the convenience of a centralized storage system, and bad news if you value choice. Once again Microsoft has intermingled code. They could have provided an API. This feature is a major thumb-of-the-nose at the US Department of Justice and the US Court of Appeals, and of course to independent developers. It seems certain that they will end up in court over this."/>
				<outline text="On a personal note, some Dave-designed software is shipping in XP, in the SOAP 1.1 support which is the underpinning of &quot;Web Services&quot; in XP. I'm proud of this, that SOAP could be part of the future of operating system development is something we dreamed about in 1998, and now appears to be becoming a reality."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="JabberCon in Keystone">
				<outline text="Last week I went to JabberCon in Keystone, Colorado. It was great, we invented all kinds of new stuff, but like all geek conferences, the male-to-female ratio was about 50-to-1. On the drive back to Denver I had an idea. There must be conferences where the ratio is reversed. So let's pair conferences? A librarian conference at the same facility as a developer conference. They'd get better software and we'd get more users and kinder feedback? I really like making software for librarians. I wish they knew. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I peer into taboo">
				<outline text="Now on to the really interesting stuff."/>
				<outline text="It's demonstrable that the leadership in the software world is male. Most, but not all of the reportage too. And software is developed by men with few exceptions. I'm not saying anything should change, there may be a reason men's minds are better suited to creating complex and dark caves and patiently retrying connections. Evolution created us differently from women."/>
				<outline text="Now, given that we're a male-only community, never mind why, a bunch of things fall into place. We don't work together. We reinvent each others' wheel. We're all fighting to be recognized. Me me me! We are a bunch of individuals, fighting for our own causes, not seeing the big picture, the benefits of working together. Of course it's this way, because we are men."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Now I plunge into the deep end">
				<outline text="Men are the artists of our species, women are the infrastructure. Art and war are the same thing. People overlook the creativity that comes from war, it's painful at a species level, but it's there and really good art is as destructive as war, creating space for new stuff as we reinvent ourselves, at a rapidly accelerating pace."/>
				<outline text="In the early Web there were domains that were almost exclusively female, such as librarians, as discussed above. Women took the lead in building the early Web. That's how apple.com got on the air. Everywhere I looked were secretaries and librarians, doing the organizing and writing. The Web is a structure of processes and documents. Women get that in a way men don't. Evolution created them that way. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Some people think I'm a sexist">
				<outline text="Probably no technology at any point in history had any real amount of feminine energy, but we could do it now because there's been a change. Women have more freedom now than ever before, but it won't get any better if they have to behave like men in order to to be leaders. "/>
				<outline text="We need change in both genders to accomodate changes in technology (mostly birth control, I suspect). We'll do better if each gender can respect the unique capabilities of the other &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the same gender. We need art and we need civilization. We've had 20+ years of intense art. Now we need to connect it all together, and we need help to do that, because we're mostly men, and men don't do civilization."/>
				<outline text="We touched on this, very tangentially, in the closing cocktail party at JabberCon. A Scandanavian man whose name I didn't get said it's like this (cut-throat and destructive) in all other professions, software is no different. I countered by saying that there was continuity in other art-forms that we don't have in software. No one thinks of big corporate bureaucracies as being capable of art in any other area that I know of, not even medicine, or car design (the creative people are at least identifiable). "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's even worse than it appears">
				<outline text="In software we believe that an entity of 45K people can  create things, when if we applied the scientific method, we'd see clearly that they do not. Individuals create things, and at that we've done quite well, all things considered. But we have never consciously decided to have a civilization, and I believe we need to do that in order to have one."/>
				<outline text="The irony is that our technology is most useful in creating civilization, for sharing knowledge, managing processes, creating connections. Emphatically it's not just a dark cave that's fun to create, over and over; it has applications that can transform civilization."/>
				<outline text="But today our culture is indisputably ruled by male energy. It's also why we get in trouble over and over. We can never win. This year PC sales are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/618730.asp?0dm=C27BB&quot;&gt;declining&lt;/a&gt; while Moore's Law rages on. There's no better way of illustrating the power of our selfish individuality. That we're in trouble now is a very clear indication. Something is seriously wrong here. Something has got to change. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I know, I'm a terrible person">
				<outline text="I ran the previous sections as an article on Scripting News over the weekend, and as you might imagine, it provoked a strong response because it is so ridiculously far from being politically correct. (Which of course is not the same thing as being incorrect.)"/>
				<outline text="I know these ideas are generalizations, male and female energy come in all kinds of packages. The forces of evolution have been working for millions of years, the changes in our society due to new technology for much less time. These are the things I think, the things I notice, based on a mere 46 years of living. I've been called names, labeled a sexist and an anachronism, but so what. Save yourself the trouble of making it about me, I'm just one person. Think bigger."/>
				<outline text="I notice that there aren't many women standing beside us, helping us, working with us, in our male-dominated industry. Women seem to listen to other women better than they listen to men, and men don't listen at all. "/>
				<outline text="I envision something greater, more inclusive, more fun. This is my way of expressing that."/>
				<outline text="I hoped to hear about people's visions, and wanted to share Donna Romer's thoughts on this. She is an entrepreneur-in-residence at the EastWest VentureGroup in Los Angeles. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Donna Romer on gender balance in high tech">
				<outline text="Dave, I have to say that I read you every day, and while I don't always agree with your views on various topics, I do greatly support the &quot;voice&quot; with which you write and the range of topics you pry open."/>
				<outline text="I have been writing commercial software for over 20 years, everything from desktop apps to enterprise systems. Over the course of my career, I have typically been the only woman on an all-male team of engineers for most of the projects that I have worked on. My experience has been quite different from what I have read so far from your other readers, particularly on the peer level. Let me emphasize the &quot;P&quot; word. In general, I have found that when there is no hierarchy involved, there is no difference between male and female roles on an engineering team. It is about the size of the group, what you know and your cleverness at solving problems that is important. As soon as there is a strict set of levels for people, then the alpha male dust goes flying in all directions. "/>
				<outline text="At the same time, entrance into that peer group is what this discussion is all about, primarily. The issue is why women are not interested in computing. Well, it may be the same reason why a lot of men find computing unappealing as well. I actually don't think that the reason is &quot;necessarily&quot; a gender one. Try asking a man that you know why the computer industry was not appealing to him for his career choice and you might find some interesting responses. "/>
				<outline text="I am interested in this topic, so have asked several people this one over the years. Usually they say things like:"/>
				<outline text="1. It is too solitary of a profession."/>
				<outline text="2. I wouldn't like to work in a field where there is only one way of doing things."/>
				<outline text="3. It seems so dry."/>
				<outline text="4. It is too logical and not creative."/>
				<outline text="5. You have to be a control freak."/>
				<outline text="Strangely, this doesn't sound at all like the work that I have been doing for the last 20 years. Most of the time I have been part of an interactive and wildly social group of people, who each have a point of view for problem solving and system creation. Logical? Some of the most illogical things have been done in the name of computer science. The only one I can't refute is the control freak one -- but then again, there are shades of grey."/>
				<outline text="Is there a male conspiracy to keep women out of computing? Heck no. But there is a computing gatekeeper in the form of perception that deters a lot of people. Once into the profession, is there discrimination? You betcha! But that is true across the board for women in all professions. "/>
				<outline text="There is no doubt in my mind that gender balanced engineering teams are a very, very good thing. My experience has been that groups are more self-organizing when that happens. It usually means that the normal forms of hierarchy are subverted, and people have a more open form of communication. And as far as I can tell, developing software is all about peer level communication and cooperation within your group, and with your corner of the industry! When I finally moved into technical exec positions and started implementing teams with these characteristics, I was amazed at the &quot;mostly&quot; successful results. People were generally happier and more creative, committed, open minded, etc. when the tone quality of the group is about clarity and cooperation and not politics. "/>
				<outline text="So what can we all do to help our industry keep evolving and be more inclusive? It is not the affirmative action thing that most people offer. Instead, I think that all people involved in software need to look hard at the social groups that we form to do our work. Blow apart the hierarchies, build radically different, self-organizing teams, create groups with extreme communication, share excellence, and then see what is attracted to that structure. "/>
				<outline text="And anyone who gets into positions of technical leadership man or woman, can promote a part of the solution because it is good for everyone."/>
				<outline text="Donna"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Comments">
				<outline text="Thanks for the great story, and congratulations to Ms Romer, who was the first person who responded to the top level, not the details, of what I wrote, or challenged my right to say it. "/>
				<outline text="In case it isn't clear, there was a strategic reason for digging this up. This time around the loop I want to make sure it's not just the destructive and self-important that speak. I want to be sure that people who love The Big Picture have a voice. I don't care if they're from Venus or Mars."/>
				<outline text="I think the differences between the genders are below the superficial level. So far we've managed to glorify the superficial differences, to the disempowerment of all."/>
				<outline text="Instead, let's use the new networking tools to open the industry to everyone with a mind who wants to participate, find a new more interesting balance, and then see what happens. "/>

It was great to get those ideas out, and even better that for the most part my point of view was tolerated, even though I am a man and am supposed to be politically correct and only say things that are pre-approved by the feminist culture I'm part of. That of course, was the point. It hardly matters that I was making generalizations about gender, that just happens to be what my mind revolves around, something I have in common with most adult women and men (another generalization of course)."/>
				<outline text="In baseball left field is considered a very strange place for things to come from. But in technology, all that remains is left field. Home plate is in tatters. The Dow dropped below 10,000 yesterday. The Dotcom Mania is totally unravelled and now we're heading below that. If we're going to get back on to Moore's curve for growth in technology it's going to take some radical thinking to do so. One of the theories for how to do this is to look carefully at barriers that we can eliminate, and one of those barriers are superficial assumptions about the roles of the genders. We've focused so much on limits imposed on women, and ignored that we also put serious limits on men. This came out clearly in many of the offlist discussions from the last piece. "/>
				<outline text="Now back to ones and zeroes, and boys killing boys, the usual themes of technology."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Connecting dots">
				<outline text="A few days ago a discussion started on Wes Felter's discussion &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; about the architecture of scripting in Microsoft .NET. There was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$5341?mode=day&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Vandenberg that really connected the dots for me, and I wrote the first half of a white paper on Microsoft's Scripting Strategy. "/>
				<outline text="As I wrote it, its brilliance was revealed. It's really quite clever, and very much from the Microsoft playbook. A total Embrace and Extend strategy, applied to all the scripting languages and runtimes in popular use. The recipe is to iteratively suck in all the developers they possibly can, and to leave those who don't get sucked in at a disadvantage in the market. Repeat till done. "/>
				<outline text="Now I have much more invested in the independence of developers, so I wanted to do what I can to provide them with my theory of how Microsoft's pieces fit together, now, before they're all deployed, while there's still time to mount a complementary strategy, a zig to Microsoft's zag, so that both approaches will be present in the scripting world of 2005. "/>
				<outline text="As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem with Microsoft doing what Microsoft does as long as the rest of us act in our own self-interest. The situation I'd like to avoid is a one party system, like the one we have in Web browsers today, and in desktop operating systems. "/>
				<outline text="One of Microsoft's valid arguments in the antitrust proceedings has been the inability of their competition to get their act together. I'm doing my part to try to help all of us work in our own interests. (And at the same time, of course, in my interest.) "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Microsoft's scripting strategy">
				<outline text="So here are some of my ideas about Microsoft's scripting strategy. "/>
				<outline text="I don't know any of these things as fact, it's just how I think they're playing it. "/>
				<outline text="I'm borrowing from the playbooks of IBM, Apple, Novell, and of course Microsoft. "/>
				<outline text="A hat-tip to all devious thinkers everywhere!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Assumptions">
				<outline text="The most popular languages: JavaScript, Java, Visual Basic, Perl, Python."/>
				<outline text="The most popular runtimes: MSIE, Apache, Java, IIS, Netscape, Visual Basic."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Strategy">
				<outline text="One runtime: Microsoft Common Language Runtime or CLR, on Windows only. (See Caveat, below.)"/>
				<outline text="Every popular language runs in the CLR, however the runtimes are different. You can't take code written to run in the Python environment and run it in Microsoft's, and vice versa. "/>
				<outline text="Bifurcate each community, those who run their code in the specialized runtimes, and those who run their code in the common runtime. "/>
				<outline text="Iterate, in each release of the Microsoft runtime offer more features to incentivize developers to move to the common runtime. "/>
				<outline text="Repeat the word &quot;common&quot; in every possible context as often as possible. It's not the only one, it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=common&quot;&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; one."/>
				<outline text="At the same time, offer incentives to corporations to standardize on the common runtime. Lower cost of code integration. Choice of syntax. Broader base of developers to hire. Free or low-cost training. Trade real estate on various Microsoft Internet services. "/>
				<outline text="Sorry no migration of existing code. It's a one-way street. The developers come in, but they can't bring their code with them. (It won't run, the libraries are different, the languages had to change to make the transition. It conserves developer training, but not code. The PHB's won't understand the issue, they'll think the programmers are being difficult.)"/>
				<outline text="Give it a few years, a few iterations. Then.. Once prominence is achieved for the runtime, decrease support for the various languages in favor of C#. Optimizations are done in C#. Easy transition from your favorite syntax to the common one."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Block diagram">
				<outline text="A block diagram that summarizes the two views of the scripting world of 2005."/>
				<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/images/scriptingWorld2005smaller.gif "/>
				<outline text="In one view, we're all inside Microsoft's box, sharing a common set of libraries and object hierarchies. In the other view, we use our favorite tools and runtimes, our communities stay independent. The glue that connects us is XML-RPC and SOAP."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Caveat">
				<outline text="Wes Felter asks: &quot;What about the CLR on BSD? Is that a smokescreen?&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Without a doubt.  Microsoft doesn't make any money off each BSD install. It does nothing to enhance the position of Windows or Office. Unlike Apple, BSD doesn't own any patents that could shut down any Microsoft projects.  "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Discussion">
				<outline text="Microsoft has said clearly that they cannot work with the GPL. I'm not sure which if any languages this excludes, or if language syntax can be covered by such a license agreement. (Almost certainly not.) Microsoft had success with Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, CP/M, etc in the 80s. Remember that Gates was really hands-on in this period and he once again is driving the software strategy. Assume they're serious about all syntaxes running in their runtime, and assume that runtime-level compatibility is meaningless to them, there's an embrace and extend happening for each developer community. "/>
				<outline text="In 2005 developers will face a choice like the one in 1981. Which OS should you develop for. The original PC had three operating systems -- CP/M-86, UCSD P-system or PC-DOS. It's nice to have a choice, but we all know which is the favored one. Microsoft loves languages, but they also love to save money. If you only have to develop and maintain one codebase, you can use the internal developer-hours for projects that make money. (Developer tools and runtimes are almost purely strategic activities, generating a relatively small amount of money.) As PC-DOS was the consensus choice in 1981, in the Microsoft scripting world of 2001, C# is the default, we all know it, factor that into your thinking, it's a certainty."/>
				<outline text="It's now clear why MS was willing to release the source for the runtime. None of its competition is well-enough organized to create an alternative to Microsoft's centralized runtime to make a difference. Based on the experience with Netscape, even if an alternative could be organized on a corporate level, it's a safe bet that the engineering could never sustain two or three year competition with MS engineering. Further, they'll have all other kinds of lock-in at the service level. To create a competitive runtime you have to be able to bundle with all the OEMs to make it effective. In other words, who cares about the source code. And if all that fails, they always have great lawyers and patents."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What does everyone else do?">
				<outline text="Now we get to the interesting stuff."/>
				<outline text="What if you don't work at Microsoft, and today in 2001 are happy working in Python, Apache, Perl, Java or whatever, exactly as it is. You like the community, you get along with its leaders, you're making good money, life is good, and you don't want to become a Microsoft developer. What do you do?"/>
				<outline text="Sorry no answers now. ;-&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I want to flesh this thinking out over a few days, and then listen, and see if there aren't ideas out there for short quick things we could do to enhance integration between the various runtimes, without forcing all code to run in Microsoft's runtime. It's not up to me whether or not independent developers get a strategy in place to exist in the world Microsoft envisions,  it's up to the members of the various communities that now exist independently, to preserve their independence. Some have wished that a czar would appear to tell them what to do, but that is a contradiction, with another czar we no longer have independence. For the nth time, all it takes is a will to work together for the benefit of all. That's the revolution we're all waiting for. Anyone can be a hero of this revolution, and in order for it to mean anything, it must remain that way."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, in the past when I rush to make a recommendation, it often doesn't go anywhere, so let's pause and give it some thought."/>
				<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
				<outline text="PS: PHB stands for Pointy Haired Boss, one of the characters in Dilbert comics."/>
				<outline text="PPS: BSD stands for Berkeley Software Distribution. The term has come to stand for a style of open source license, that unlike the GPL (see below) places few constraints on how code can be used. It is also used to refer to a specific version of Unix called BSD, or FreeBSD."/>
				<outline text="PPPS: GPL stands for General Public License, a license favored by the &quot;free&quot; software movement, led by Richard Stallman.

				<outline text="&quot;You don't need no gypsy to tell you why. You can't let one precious day slip by. Look inside yourself, and if you don't see what you want, maybe sometimes then you don't, but leave your mind alone and just get high.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Exactly!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Winding-down and consolidating">
				<outline text="Against the backdrop of consolidation, let's start a new thread. "/>
				<outline text="The technology revolution of the 90s, the Web, is winding-down, in dramatic ways. Assume it'll find a bottom, we will be using the Web for the forseeable future, much as we still use PCs, laser printers and spreadsheets. It may go down a predictable path, but also may morph into something different from what we thought it was."/>
				<outline text="Assume there will be false revolutions -- as there were as the industry tried to self-induce hypergrowth in the past. Concepts like artificial intelligence, object oriented programming, PDAs, push technology or P2P. Of course each of these technologies eventually became part of the technology landscape, but not at the times their promoters tried to bootstrap them, and usually were not the root of the revolution, just a feature. Timing matters, the market must be ready, the infrastructure already deployed or quickly deployable. Many other criteria apply to raising a new technology to the revolutionary level."/>
				<outline text="Lurking amid the false revolutions are the gems. That's what we want. Ideas like personal computers and spreadsheets in the early 80s, graphic user interfaces in the mid 80s, desktop publishing in the late 80s, or networking in the mid 90s. "/>
				<outline text="If the past is a guide, true revolutions are not immediately apparent to many people. I missed desktop publishing, for example, because I didn't understand how fast printer technology had been developing, and how much demand there was for inexpensive typesetting. I didn't miss the Web because my mind was pretty empty when it came along and a good friend was persistent at nagging me to take a look. I like to think I have a creative mind, but I can easily miss the next revolution unless I'm systematic about looking for it."/>
				<outline text="In the middle of the booms people are too busy to see new possibilities, but now the demand for revolutionary ideas is high. People are looking and listening, new ideas can take hold. This is what Silicon Valley does during recessions -- we develop technology and infrastructure to fuel the next revolution. If we bet right, growth can come back more quickly."/>
				<outline text="So here's the crucial question.."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is the next technology revolution?">
				<outline text="To answer the question I'm going back to the roots. "/>
				<outline text="In 1994, this column started with a discussion with its readers. First I stated my vision for PDAs, got pushback from Motorola, then the leading developer of PDAs. I declared Microsoft and the other BigCo's routed around by the Internet, and got pushback from Bill Gates. We did 24 Hours of Democracy in 1995, to demonstrate the power of the Internet to express massive quantities of ideas and stories, and went on to start tens of thousands of independent websites for the same purpose."/>
				<outline text="Now we know how to use this medium much more effectively than we did in the beginning. I want to dig ideas out of the minds of the smart people we know and leave an archive behind so next time we can do even better."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="September 26 at Seybold in San Francisco">
				<outline text="On Wednesday, 9/26 at 8:30AM, we will discuss this in a 90 minute session at the Seybold Publishing Conference in San Franscisco at Moscone. We'll also publish the results on the Web."/>
				<outline text="Attendance at the session will be open to all who participate in the process, so if you're in San Francisco on the 26th, we hope to see you face to face. If it goes as I hope, it will be a very large session, with lots of value, some in the moment, and some over time. We'll keep the archive online indefinitely, as we have with similar projects dating back to the mid-90s. "/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="Words, not-wasted (hopefully)">
				<outline text="There's a circle in the center of the page which represents the idealogical firewall of open source. Describing that would take a short essay. But let's assume it's really there. Source code flows from inside the circle to the outside. Interestingly, none of the major open source scripting tools and runtimes are controlled by a GPL license, nor is Apache. So, for these projects, technology flows out of the circle without restriction."/>
				<outline text="Two circles intersect with the open source circle, one for BigCo's and one for Independent Developers. I made these circles separate because the two groups behave quite differently. Independents don't want to be everything to everyone. Even though I put AOL in the BigCo circle, interestingly, they behave more like an independent. But they are so big they must be in the Big circle. I made the two circles the same size, because I believe if all the indies work together (a big if of course) they're just as powerful (if not more so) than The Bigs. Two new additions to the Independent circle are VA Linux and CollabNet, both of whom are now mixed commercial and open source developers. UserLand is in the Independent Developer circle."/>
				<outline text="Inside the open source circle at the center of the page are the various parts that make up &lt;i&gt;the idea&lt;/i&gt; of open source today: Leaders, Developers, Money, Press, XML, and Slashdot."/>
				<outline text="Leaders are the most visible, they're the handle by which most people pick up open source. They are quoted in the press, the VCs invested in them, they're linked to from Slashdot, and they have even exerted power in XML. The system is built on the presence of the leaders. People have said that we should ignore the leaders, but to have done so would have missed what's going on in the connection between money and open source and press. As the pure open source companies reposition, and the idealogical leaders scramble, we can see clearly that money played a big role, as it always does."/>
				<outline text="The developers inside the main circle are those who create open source without a business model. People who moonlight, teens who are in school, or people who otherwise do open source strictly for love. Source code flows out of the circle, created by these people, but they're very often unsung heroes."/>
				<outline text="Money fueled the hype, but that's now over. If we redraw this picture in 2003, it will not be inside the central circle. But the money is still floating around, it's not totally spent yet. If open source is to survive in the future, money will flow into the circle from the BigCo and Independent Developer circles."/>
				<outline text="The Press will take a lot longer to fade out. They present open source as the Enemy of Microsoft. In never-ending battle of Boy vs Boy, the courageous leaders of open source take on the Evil Empire. They will not be assimilated. It's David vs Goliath for the 180th time. A battle to the end."/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/&quot;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; is different. It's the community voice of open source, with a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=mealymouthed&quot;&gt;mealymouthed&lt;/a&gt; idiots thrown in at no extra cost. ;-&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And finally XML. When this picture is redrawn next year, I think XML is going to be much bigger part of what's going on. It's about open interfaces, choice, and no lock-in. It makes ideas flow through the firewall, even if apps are GPL-licensed. It's the lever under Stallman, and if we're smart and really courageous, it also routes around Microsoft."/>

It seems whoever did it must have had a lot of luck on their side. "/>
				<outline text="Speaking with my mother today who survived the Nazi Holocaust, she is certain that Jews will get the blame. I asked if we can we hope for something better to come from this. Perhaps a new connection between peace-loving people everywhere?"/>
				<outline text="John Robb, a former Air Force pilot, and UserLand COO, &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wtcattack/message/124&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the airline security problem raised by the hijackings can be dealt with, but the larger issue of American prosperity is on the line.

				<outline text="John Perry Barlow &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wtcattack/message/93&quot;&gt;likens&lt;/a&gt; the attack to destruction of the Reichstag that brought the Nazis to power in Germany in 1933. I hope he's wrong about that. Instead, with the incredible communication tools we now have, I hope that the tragedy of my parents' youth does not have to be relived today. Let's look for ways to add peace to the world, not to go to war. These were heinous and cowardly acts, it's just beginning to sink in how much things have changed. Can we make things turn for the better? I wonder, I'm not sure, but I have hope."/>
				<outline text="Yesterday it would have made no sense to ask if we are at war. Yesterday was a normal day. Today started normally too. I have a feeling that the takeaway from this will be There's No Time Like Now. Yeah, there's no time like now to start forgiving, to turn the other cheek, to show the world that we're really tough, and that we're commited to making the world work better. What better way would there be to do that than to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; go to war in response to a cowardly and disgusting act of war."/>

			<outline text="Welcome">
				<outline text="There are a lot of new people reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and first I want to welcome them to the community. Welcome. "/>
				<outline text="There are lots of ways to communicate with others, today the preferred way is to join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scriptingNewsWorldTradeCenter&quot;&gt;special mail list&lt;/a&gt; for the topic of the day, which started out earlier this week as the bombing of the World Trade Center in NY, but now is broadening to cover the world of opinion. "/>
				<outline text="The list is sure to flame out at some point, at which time we'll start a new list. That's life on the Internet."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I am a pacifist">
				<outline text="If you want to understand my site, here's something you need to know about me. &lt;i&gt;I am a pacifist.&lt;/i&gt; I'm always going to look for a way to avoid killing people, or being killed myself. I think we don't listen well enough, and many people are proud of their barriers to listening, and these days they have all kinds of excuses for parading this. Racism is rampant. This is a good thing, believe it or not, because the feelings were always there, now we get to find out who among us have these feelings. They're better expressed in emails than in warfare."/>
				<outline text="I am also a Jew, first-generation American, a proud son of Holocaust survivors. An aging hippie. Raised in NY, a Mets fan. Bronx Science graduate (and Tulane and UW-Madison). Independent software developer. Writer. And (I hope) listener and transmitter of well-stated points of view. I am a thirsty student. Teach me. But I don't care for arguments that boil down to this: shut up. I believe in the power of communication, or I wouldn't be putting my time into fostering communication now, at a time, when so many have so much to say."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Palestinians">
				<outline text="I especially want to hear from other people who are caught in the middle of this week's events. We've heard from the Israelis, the Europeans, god knows we've heard from Americans -- but what about the Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims? Where are their voices?"/>
				<outline text="I love my parents, and the memory of my grandparents -- but they taught me something that's wrong -- that Palestinians are all terrorists who hate the United States and (more important to them) Jews. "/>
				<outline text="Then in 1998, I had a fantastic experience. I designed a protocol with two people from Microsoft, and get this, one of them is Palestinian. A brilliant man, raised in Los Angeles, works at Microsoft, we couldn't be more different, but we also had something in common -- a love for fairness and chaos and freedom. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt; we designed is, today, a big success. "/>
				<outline text="And perhaps in this time of trouble it can be a small symbol of peace and cooperation, and finding ways to heal the wounds, to make up for past wrongs, and move on to something brighter, more loving, and more fun."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Extreme pacifism">
				<outline text="I just sent an email to my mother, a NY school psychologist, who witnessed the destruction of the WTC from a rooftop in Brooklyn. She told me about a ceremony of solidarity to take place at 7PM Eastern today. Let's hold candles, where ever we are, and light up the sky with our love. We're the survivors. We are living. Now, as Microsoft asks, Where do we want to go today?"/>
				<outline text="Here's what I said, and asked: &quot;Now is the time to open our ears and listen, and see what comes back. Would you be willing to go on a citizen's mission of peace to the Middle East, to feed Palestinian children, to help them as you have helped the children of NY?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="In the past we might have felt this was too dangerous to consider, but now we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; we're all at risk, no matter where we live. That's been true for a long time, but this week we got the wakeup call. In many ways the Palestinian people are just like us. They love their families, value education and scholarship, and because they've been living at risk for their whole lives, probably can teach us about the value of life and freedom, and at a more pragmatic level, how to survive in a world where terrorism is a daily fact of life."/>
				<outline text="And could we have the reverse? Could peace-loving Palestinians come to our country, to help us with our pain and grief? What would they say to us after the anger subsides? Could we set aside our pride and admit that we need help now? When we really listen, understand what life has been like for them, would we still be enemies? I think not."/>
				<outline text="Cynical people have always dismissed pacifism as unrealistic, but such people couldn't have imagined suicidal bombers, people who believe so strongly in their cause that they were willing to die for it. Now pacifism probably doesn't seem so extreme. Turning the other cheek is the right response. (And tightening airport security, of course.) "/>
				<outline text="We now know for a fact that the heart of humanity is still ticking. Now, when so many hearts are open, is the time to solidify that, ratify that, accept that. Life is not flat and uneventful. We &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; change. The best way to isolate evil, if it really exists, is to surround it with love."/>

			<outline text="Rick Smolan">
				<outline text="Rick Smolan is an old friend from the 80s. He sent me an email this afternoon. &quot;Dave, the following was sent to me by a friend of &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?WRD=Mir+Tamim+Ansary&amp;userid=19JCN7T4LY&quot;&gt;Mir Tamim Ansary&lt;/a&gt;. Tamim is an Afghani-American writer. He is one of the most brilliant people I know. Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in. I know your email reaches a lot of people and I think the following is really worth forwarding.&quot; "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Mir Tamim Ansary on Afghanistan">
				<outline text="I've been hearing a lot of talk about &quot;bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ronn.com/&quot;&gt;Ronn Owens&lt;/a&gt;, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this atrocity, but &quot;we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What else can we do?&quot; Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we &quot;have the belly to do what must be done.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing. "/>
				<outline text="I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters. "/>
				<outline text="But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. They're not even the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan. When you think Taliban, think Nazis. When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think &quot;the people of Afghanistan&quot; think &quot;the Jews in the concentration camps.&quot;   It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They were the first victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country. "/>
				<outline text="Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban? The answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering. A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan , a country with no economy, no food. There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered with land mines, the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban. "/>
				<outline text="We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it already. Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level their houses? Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done. Eradicate their hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut them off from medicine and health care?  Too late. Someone already did all that. "/>
				<outline text="New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. Would they at least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around. They'd slip away and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans, they don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people they've been raping all this time "/>
				<outline text="So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops. When people speak of &quot;having the belly to do what needs to be done&quot; they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed. Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on the table is Americans dying. And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout. It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will other Muslim nations just stand by? You see where I'm going. We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the West. "/>
				<outline text="And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he wants. That's why he did this. Read his speeches and statements. It's all right there. He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of view. He's probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else? "/>

				<outline text="Remember a couple of weeks ago (seems like a lifetime) when I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/08/28/genderBalanceInHighTech&quot;&gt;gender balance&lt;/a&gt; in high tech? The piece was filled with generalizations. Men do art and war, women do civilization and infrastructure, etc. "/>
				<outline text="OK, now we're going to war, or according to some (like the US president) we're already at war. Now, most of the voices we're hearing are male. That's not a big surprise. A few are preaching restraint, don't be so linear (the bad guys &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; we have nukes and lots of cash and planned for it) but most are on a straight line to a conventional war in Afghanistan, which to me, is the most idiotic linear thing we could possibly do. "/>
				<outline text="Now emotions rule, and the TV networks know how to manipulate emotions on a massive scale, and of course they're doing it. (I don't know this first-hand, no TV here, just NPR and the Web.) "/>
				<outline text="Wired &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,46862,00.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; this is the first Internet war, and I think they're right. So this could be the first war where women have a voice. Imho, civilization and infrastructure need to speak up, before we flush it all down the toilet. I fear that's exactly what's happening. I'm not kidding about that. "/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="Don't be linear">
				<outline text="This is totally a male thing. We get an answer, maybe just a preliminary one, and attach to it and never let it go. We're very modal beasts. We need to get less linear, be more dubious, think more strategically. "/>
				<outline text="While we're confused and emotional, new laws are being passed, that make some pretty terrible things legal. The next thing is to make some pretty sacred things illegal. "/>

				<outline text="If this is the first Internet war, let's use the tools while we still have them. "/>
				<outline text="The terrorists used airplanes loaded with civillians as bombs. They can use the Internet too, or despite what others have said, it probably wouldn't be too hard to knock out the Internet. Assume that's going to happen. And the US governmment, the good guys, probably would like to shut down the Internet too. Perhaps just for a while. Heh."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="It won't work again">
				<outline text="I don't remember where I heard or read this, but I believe it."/>
				<outline text="They won't use the same trick again. Next time they try to use a knife to take control of an airliner, the passengers will do what they did on the Pittsburgh flight. The bad guys will factor that into their plans. The next time they strike it will be in a completely different way. Whatever it is, it'll probably happen at the worst possible time."/>
				<outline text="However we don't know for a fact that they &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; have the bombs they said they had. Or do we?"/>

				<outline text="That's not normal. Will it last?"/>
				<outline text="Let's say we nuke Afghanistan."/>
				<outline text="Maybe then they'll be rooting for Uncle Osama."/>
				<outline text="I don't trust the love -- I think people are scared out of their minds. If it can happen in the US, it can happen anywhere. Civilization may be getting flushed. If we retaliate in kind world opinion will swing the other way. "/>

Fredrik shows us that the WTC was part of the world, not just the US."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Upgrade defenses">
				<outline text="Like it or not, we must take some of the responsibility for the people who died on Tuesday, for the destruction of World Trade Center, the damage to the Pentagon and the US financial system. "/>
				<outline text="Our defenses didn't anticipate this kind of attack. So we must enhance our defenses to protect our cities with the same intelligence and diligence that we secure our computer networks. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Clearly defined goals">
				<outline text="Like all wars we're getting ready to fight the last one again. Probably the Gulf War. But, if you recall the takeaway of the military from Vietnam was they would never again fight a war without clearly defined goals. Has that changed? "/>
				<outline text="It's too weird. Afghanistan was the Soviets' Vietnam. Round and round. Only this time the provocation wasn't in the Tonkin Gulf. And instead of following the French, we're following the Soviets."/>
				<outline text="I bet even Saddam Hussein will help us get this war started. I can't believe we're taking the bait. Too linear to be real."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="If we get back to peace">
				<outline text="If we manage to get the war off the front-burner, there are some things we should do right away."/>
				<outline text="The first thing to do is to solidify our friendships. Let's ask our allies what we can do better, and really listen and respond. As an economy and a culture, not just as a government and military."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Starbuck's">
				<outline text="Our culture dominates the world. Until last week, the war was totally cultural. "/>

It's what the WTO protests were about. In the US we sniff at this, but globalization is flattening our culture too. "/>
				<outline text="I like Starbucks, but I don't think it belongs in NY. Disney owns Times Square. McDonald's, Hertz, CNN, Mickey Mouse, Hollywood, Microsoft and IBM, Coke and Pepsi, etc, are all everywhere now."/>
				<outline text="What do we do about this? Listen. And learn and self-impose restraint. See the bombing as related to our domination of world culture. Much of the support the terrorists hope to gain will be about exactly that. It's really there, the resentment, anger, and it's justified. I see it in a small way when I see McDonalds in Copenhagen. To me it looks like home, but to others -- what does it look like?"/>
				<outline text="A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/09/13&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; we should look for things we did that are wrong, and apologize for them. "/>

				<outline text="The World Wide Web Consortium, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;, is the keeper of many important Web standards including HTML, XML and HTTP."/>
				<outline text="The W3C is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=consortium&quot;&gt;consortium&lt;/a&gt; of companies of all sizes. My company, UserLand Software, is a member. We agree on a common philosophy -- a level playing field, interoperation between software, and choice for users and developers. That's the foundation that the Web was built on, it's what kept the Web ticking through the dotcom lunacy."/>
				<outline text="Now several large companies, led by Microsoft, Philips, Apple and Hewlett-Packard, are trying to become the platform vendor that the Internet never had, and imho that's totally counter to the charter for the Internet, and therefore, the W3C. "/>
				<outline text="We may not have the support of the US government in re freedom for developers, but at least we can shame the abusers, force them back into hiding, lest their customers and partners get wind of their greed. "/>
				<outline text="I'm sorry that I tuned in to this so late -- with the confusion around the WTC disaster, we need more time to investigate and build public opinion, but the deadline for comment on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/08/16-PP-FAQ&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/patent-policy/&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;i&gt;today. &lt;/i&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Software patents">
				<outline text="Software patents are bad. Period. Investment in new practice happens without them, and choice is essential for progress in our art."/>
				<outline text="The economics of software favor small independent developers, patents change that. To develop in the world these companies envision, you'd have to have their legal and financial resources to create and publish software. No more small developers. Not good for anyone but the shareholders of the BigCo's -- and long-term it's not good for them either. Where do you think the BigCo's get their ideas? Heh. We've seen what happens when monopolies take over, utter stagnation. Keep them on their toes, let them constantly worry about competition from left field. The W3C used to help us, now they're talking about switching over to the dark side. "/>
				<outline text="Further, I believe that none of these patents will stand up to a First Amendment test. The line between software and speech is non-existent. The act of writing software is very much like writing a short story, a novel, or a news story. I could add a line of code to this piece (I do all the time) and reading the page on the Web could cause code to execute on our server (it does) and then, where is the line? If I write about something that Microsoft or Apple have a patent on, can I explain the idea with a demo? Technically I could often do that. And if the law stops me, where is the First Amendment of the US Constitution? (In the dumpster.)"/>
				<outline text="In an open letter to Stephen King, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/07/24/doYouKnowStepenKing&quot;&gt;I wrote on 7/24/00&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;To put it in analogous terms for writers, imagine if you couldn't write a story because Dean Koontz had already written it. What if the idea were as basic as Boy Meets Girl? That's what's going on in another creative space, software.&quot; "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Bigger picture">
				<outline text="There's also a new law pending in Washington called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,46655,00.html&quot;&gt;SSSCA&lt;/a&gt;, which, if passed, would also shut down the independent software developers, to benefit the entertainment business. I'm sorry that I can't cover this in detail, there aren't enough hours in the day. In the meantime, a general statement follows."/>
				<outline text="To our government, we're turning the resources of the Internet to watch and report on all aspects of the current crisis. It's a national priority to both improve security &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; preserve freedom. We have new power to inform, more people who think are turning to weblogs. I support the US and our President because of the threat to our lives and way of life. However, don't use this time of crisis to shut down free industries. We're helping because it makes sense, but these changes do not make sense, and they will not pass without observation by informed citizens."/>

			<outline text="The consortium is a conundrum">
				<outline text="The conundrum of the W3C can be seen in its name -- the World Wide Web Consortium."/>
				<outline text="The first part, World Wide Web, is at odds with the second part, the Consortium."/>
				<outline text="The Web was founded on a protocol and a format, HTTP and HTML. Both are brain-dead simple. Totally free. Easy to implement. And widely implemented."/>
				<outline text="Now, what is a consortium? It's an association of businesses. "/>
				<outline text="Ultimately the consortium will do what the businesses want it to do. "/>
				<outline text="Even if it hurts the Web."/>
				<outline text="That's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=conundrum&quot;&gt;conundrum&lt;/a&gt;."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The magic of the Web">
				<outline text="The magic of the Web is its freedom and utter low-tech-ness. The cynics who sniffed at the idealists were wrong, the dotcom crazyness is over, and the Web survives, precisely because it is open to everyone. "/>
				<outline text="The Web works because it's the World Medium, where the TV networks, magazines and newspapers are deeply rooted in specific cultures and interests, the Web can go everywhere telephones and computers go, and represent all interests because it's so easy to create and publish for the Web. "/>
				<outline text="Computers are getting very small, and telephones are now cellular, so the Web is moving into new cultures and economic levels, and that's very important in a world with so many disconnects -- the Web acts as a connector. We saw that as we covered the terrorism in NY and DC and its aftermath. For the first time we were able to directly get information and points of view from ordinary people, and in the process the Web started feeding the news flow instead of just following it. There's a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1272-210-7242676-1.html&quot;&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of cooperation  between amateur and professional journalists, and there's no doubt that the Web is at the center of this. It's important. "/>
				<outline text="The Web is not just technology, but a philosophy. Easy specs, open to everyone, no restrictions or royalties, a level playing field, and user choice. That led to freedom of speech and diversity of opinion. It's totally magic and it works, and both technological freedom and free speech are necessary for it to work. The Web is the good part of globalization, and it's important to know how that's being managed, for all people who participate."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A consortium of BigCo's">
				<outline text="In 1994 a consortium of companies was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Consortium/&quot;&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt;, led by the inventor of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee. There are companies of all size in the consortium. Since the big ones pay most of the bills, they call most of the shots. I know others would disagree with this statement, but I think it's obvious on its face. We tend to listen to money and not ideas. When Microsoft says something it has more import, with most people, than when a smaller company speaks. I wish this were not so, but sadly it is so. Let's recognize it."/>
				<outline text="There was a time when the Web drove the technology industry. This drove the BigCo's nuts. They embraced the threat, but never welcomed the Web into their lives or their long-term plans. It was an insurrection to be put down. And there are good reasons to believe that the insurrection &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; put down, if only at a technology level. Today's Web is throttled by the engineers at Microsoft who maintain the browser that has monopoly market share. It's subject to where Microsoft's strategists want to take it. With nary a peep from the caretaker consortium, they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/directory/952/smartTags&quot;&gt;moving to take control&lt;/a&gt; not just of the technology, but of the content of the Web. This would be very bad if they did it. So far we've managed to keep them at bay, but I suspect that won't last much longer."/>
				<outline text="IBM, another BigCo, has embraced open-ness, but apparently with some reservations. Same with the other big companies. It's not fair to single out Microsoft and IBM, but they are at the core of the current controversy, which hasn't been publicly documented, as far as I know."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The question">
				<outline text="There's been a lot of discussion on the Web and email over the last week as the conundrum over the W3C and patents has become visible. Apparently precipitated by a disagreement between Microsoft and IBM over patents in Web Services, the question that's been raised that few have focused on is the disconnect between the Web and the organization that's chartered with taking care of it."/>
				<outline text="Should the Web have welcomed the BigCo's on their terms, or on the terms of the Web? The Web favors low-tech easy-to-implement formats and protocols. The BigCo's for whatever reason, promote difficult formats and protocols, that tend to split the users into groups based on whose software they use, and tend to marginalize smaller developers. It's hard to switch from one brand to another. Progress may grind to a halt while they fight in court. And small companies and independent developers who are philosophically opposed to software patents will be frozen or killed while the BigCo's fight over control of the Web."/>
				<outline text="In my humble opinion, never has the world needed the World Wide Web more than it does now. Regardless of what the consortium does, freedom-loving developers and writers must work together to ensure that the medium remains open and uncontrolled by big companies."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The times we live in">
				<outline text="Anyone with a TV set or a Web browser must get that the world is in crisis."/>
				<outline text="I urge the leading technology companies to gain a sense of perspective and put their differences aside, and recognize that as businesses, they have more serious concerns than squeezing the maximum money from the Web. Their shareholders must have something to say about this. What is most important, the growth of the industry, the safety of the population, the vibrancy of the market, or the power to control the flow of ideas and information between the world's citizens?"/>
				<outline text="Isn't this at the root of the disconnect between American culture and our economy and the rest of the world?"/>
				<outline text="Fact: the companies who would control the Web are mostly American."/>
				<outline text="Today, I don't feel much like being an American. I'd rather be free."/>

				<outline text="The TV networks want reassurance for the viewers. Bedtime stories. Everything's going to be OK. Go back to sleep dear citizens of the world, we're taking care of it. This masks a chaos that we can see if we really look. Do they really know what they're doing? Hmm."/>

				<outline text="Today the Bush Administration has been publicly pressuring western TV networks to not broadcast statements from terrorist leaders fearing that they will transmit hidden messages to their &quot;sleepers&quot; in the United States and elsewhere."/>
				<outline text="But there's tremendous value in hearing directly from these people, and in the age of the Internet and cellphones, it's hard to imagine what advantage they have in broadcasting hidden messages over TV.

				<outline text="&quot;I should discuss how manliness and its brother, gentlemanliness, went out of style. I know, because I was there. In fact, I may have done it. I remember exactly when: It was in the mid-'70s, and I was in my mid-20s, and a big, nice, middle-aged man got up from his seat to help me haul a big piece of luggage into the overhead luggage space on a plane.

I embarrassed a nice man who was attempting to help a lady. I wasn't lady enough to let him. I bet he never offered to help a lady again. I bet he became an intellectual, or a writer, and not a good man like a fireman or a businessman who says, 'Let's roll.'&quot;"/>

				<outline text="Ms. Noonan, I want to say something, as a man. "/>
				<outline text="I was there in the 70s too, in my mid-20s also. We're about the same age. It's been truly confusing to be a man. I'm not John Wayne or a firefighter, but I have a big strong body and it wants to do things that weren't considered politically correct, like be protective, nurturing, and strong, all at the same time as I use my mind, which is pretty powerful too. "/>
				<outline text="You weren't and aren't a jackass, but thanks for considering the possibility. You're just living in your time. But that time may be over. We're changing. "/>

				<outline text="On Saturday I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/theSaudiPrinceQuestion&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Suppose a Saudi prince offered you $10 million, no strings attached, but you had to read his press release and listen to what he thought you were doing wrong.

			<outline text="Bush gets something">
				<outline text="I really enjoyed President Bush's press conference on Thursday night. He said so many things that made me laugh and think &quot;This guy gets it.&quot; A reporter asked how he feels about half-hearted help from Syria. (I'm paraphrasing here.) &quot;I'll take help any way I can get it, I'm a results-oriented guy&quot; says our president. Right on. Take the help, and thank them profusely. That's the philosophy of inclusion.  "/>
				<outline text="And rather than running away from the &quot;Why do they hate us so much?&quot; question, he charged right into it. &quot;We're such cool people,&quot; he says (again I'm paraphrasing). &quot;I can't believe they don't see that. We'll just have to work on it, talk with them, and explain who we are to them. It's just a misunderstanding.&quot; Excellent. Let's work on relating. There's been far too much bluster. Don't hate people because they hate us. Work on why they hate us, and see if there's a bug, and fix it. "/>
				<outline text="One more thing that made me say &quot;Right On&quot; to my President. Asked why he hasn't met with Yasir Arafat yet, he said he wouldn't appear for a photo-op until there was something to announce. He's holding out for substance. Excellent. Now is the time to do that. These are times of great change. Let's get ready for it. "/>
				<outline text="One more story. I saw an interview with a career US diplomat. He was asked why we give Mubarak in Egypt $1.5 billion per year in military aid. That was one of the terms of the peace treaty with Israel, he said. We prop up Mubarak to get peace between Israel and Egypt, and in the same moment, create a war with the citizens he keeps under control. A lesson every programmer knows well. You can't fix a bug by hiding it. Mubarak will be dead someday. Then what? "/>

I called, got the information, listened to my father speak about his disease, and then about life, his fears, and what he was learning.

				<outline text="My father survived. I saw him and my mother a week ago. It was just a short visit, but we had fun!"/>
				<outline text="What an amazing concept. Fun. With parents. And all it took was a wakeup call and some kindness between two adult men, whose internal struggles seem so small compared to reality."/>

		<outline text="The Microsoft settlement" created="11/2/2001;  8:03:26 AM" name="theMicrosoftSettlement" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;The Microsoft settlement&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/2/01; 8:03:26 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Settlement">
				<outline text="This morning the US Department of Justice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2001/9463.htm&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f9400/9462.htm&quot;&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in the Microsoft antitrust case. We've been following this case since its inception, so I wanted offer a few comments on the settlement."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Comments from an independent developer">
				<outline text="It clearly doesn't go far enough, and requires the government to be involved in the architecture of Microsoft's operating system and network services, such as SOAP, in an intimate and impractical way."/>
				<outline text="The settlement doesn't go far enough because it does nothing to restore competition to the browser market. Had these requirements been in place when Microsoft did not already have monopoly share in the browser market, it might have been effective. But today there is no Web browser that has enough share to realistically compete with Microsoft's software, nor are investors likely to take the chance of competing with Microsoft based on the weak safeguards offered by the settlement."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why the browser is the center">
				<outline text="The browser is at the center of this agreement because the Web that it browses is the most important new medium for free communication, and Microsoft has shown that it will move to control the content that is accessed through its browser. "/>
				<outline text="Relying on the Bush Administration to restrain Microsoft in this area does not provide much assurance. This is exactly the kind of role in free speech that the framers of the US Constitution were trying to prevent, especially in the First Amendment. "/>
				<outline text="The government, only in very exceptional circumstances, is allowed to control the speech of US citizens. Will they understand the free speech implications, when asked to make a decision about the next incarnation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/directory/952/smartTags&quot;&gt;Smart Tags&lt;/a&gt;, and if they do, will they act to protect speech? I'm not confident about either of those issues."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The role of hardware OEMs">
				<outline text="Further, since the network is more and more where software comes from, the role of the OEMs, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, etc, are greatly diminished. To think that they would exercise the rights the government is trying to protect is unrealistic. Today they are simply distributors for Microsoft's monopoly. I don't see any way that's going to be changed by the agreement."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Forcing open APIs">
				<outline text="The only way to protect the Web from Microsoft's control is to separate the browser from Microsoft. This would have &lt;i&gt;structurally&lt;/i&gt; forced the open APIs that the government is now going to try to enforce through oversight and negotiation. "/>
				<outline text="I wish them much luck in negotiating with Microsoft in these areas. I've learned that only market forces influence Microsoft, and therefore, the only way to force open APIs is to force Microsoft itself to depend on them. Separating the browser would have accomplished that, and would have encouraged future software monopolists to be more ethical in competition than Microsoft has been."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Not good for independent developers">
				<outline text="In conclusion, as an independent developer and investor, I don't believe that the agreement will, in any substantial way change or limit Microsoft's practices, nor is there much hope that Microsoft will self-impose restraint in the interest of a vibrant software marketplace. It is not a good settlement for independent software developers."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="The fear of government">
				<outline text="Even the US government under a Democrat president was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.epic.org/cda/cda_decision.html&quot;&gt;scared of the Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps with good cause, I'll give them that much, it's a powerful communication medium, and it can be used equally well by scientists, thinkers and people doing good as it can be used by terrorists, racists, abusers of children, and promoters of hate.

				<outline text="However silly it may seem, we made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html&quot;&gt;historic decision&lt;/a&gt; in the US, in the 18th century, to take the bad with the good. In the US, the right to speak is something the government, by design, has very little power to regulate."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What did Microsoft give up?">
				<outline text="It's a fact, Microsoft made a deal with the US government. No theorizing necessary there, it's not a matter of probability, it's a certainty. The deal was announced. Ashcroft spoke. Gates spoke. We all know it happened."/>
				<outline text="But what was the deal? What did Microsoft give up to get full control of the Internet?"/>
				<outline text="What did the government want from Microsoft, and what did Microsoft give them?"/>
				<outline text="Was it merely a campaign contribution in the 2000 election?"/>
				<outline text="Or did Microsoft promise to provide the government with access to all the information they accumulate in the Hailstorm database?"/>
				<outline text="Did Microsoft give the government the power to censor websites they think are being used by terrorists? With that power will they be able to shut down sites like the NY Times or the Washington Post if they say things that compromise the government's war effort?"/>
				<outline text="Will Microsoft support an Internet tax? "/>
				<outline text="What else? These are just the ideas that occurred to me as I thought about the possibilities this morning. I'm sure there are others I haven't thought of."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="And who did they sell out?">
				<outline text="At a certain level I'm just beginning to understand how powerful Microsoft has become."/>
				<outline text="They own the chokepoint for most of the electronic communication over email and the Web."/>
				<outline text="Now, they have to get people to upgrade to Windows XP -- that's the final step, the one that fully turns over the keys to the Internet to them, because after XP they can upgrade at will, routing through Microsoft-owned servers, altering content, and channeling communication through government servers. After XP they fully own electronic communication media, given the consent decree, assuming it's approved by the court."/>
				<outline text="Here's how it works. Because their operating system is a monopoly, so is their bundled Web browser. If one day my site were not reachable through MSIE I'd lose most of my readers. They could shut down any site they want to, and with their new partnership with the US government, they could have justification, if not moral, at least legal and pragmatic. The government has law on its side, and the FBI, CIA, NSA, FAA, FDA, the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force. Nukes and biological weapons. They're a powerful partner, and a now, a Friend of Bill."/>
				<outline text="The rest of us are totally cut out of this deal. We're taken for granted, we're dumb, fat and happy, supposedly, and the future no longer looks so bright. The fat period is over. Microsoft had a lot of power to offer to the government. The government has been granted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html&quot;&gt;new electronic surveillance power&lt;/a&gt; by Congress. Now how do they implement it? Microsoft can help. In my mind I'm not so naive to believe this was an arms-length deal, I'm certain there are aspects to the partnership between Microsoft and the US government that we can't see."/>
				<outline text="If this scares you -- good. I think we've got a problem, and the government and Microsoft are not likely to help us."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Your freedom will persist">
				<outline text="No matter what happens to the Internet, remember you are free to use your mind."/>
				<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
				<outline text="PS: In my heart I cling to the hope that the Bush Administration really doesn't understand the Web, and that Microsoft really doesn't want the power to control what is said on the Internet. In my dream they wake up and say &quot;Holy shit we didn't see that we were accumulating this much power.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="First, a question. Are flight recorders obsolete? Why not have an HTTP connection from the plane to a static server somewhere very far away.

Doc Searls, writes &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/11/12#runningOffAtTheTube&quot;&gt;on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;If you're sitting in a swamp on Rockaway Bay behind a duck blind wth a Stinger shoulder-held anti-aircraft missle launcher, an Airbus is a mighty big duck.

				<outline text="&quot;Moore's Law is apparently self-fulfilling. The implication is that somebody, somewhere is going to be able to build a better chip than you if you rest on your laurels, so you'd better start pushing hard on the problem.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Right on. That's how technology is supposed to work. No laurel-based resting."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why we're not in synch with Moore's Law">
				<outline text="John, imho, the reason our economy is not in synch with Moore's Law is the selfishness, even destructiveness, of the people of technology. The Boy Kills Boy syndrome. Everything from patents to browser wars, a very small number of people form the brakes on the advance of technology. "/>
				<outline text="Very often, not only do we have the CPU power to solve problems, we also have the software, deployed technologies, and critical mass in the user base, only to see the selfishness of individuals put a stop to forward motion. Microsoft does it for sure, so does IBM, Sun, Oracle, Apple, even the leading venture capitalists (patents) and open source gods (restrictive licenses) do it. On a smaller scale, independent developers do it to each other (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sobco.com/nww/1993/09-nih.html&quot;&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;) too."/>
				<outline text="A famous case study. Netscape ships a browser. It rages through the market. Microsoft catches up, through technical might, and a distribution monopoly, then repeatedly up the ante until the young gods at Netscape give up. Then, with a chokehold on the market, forward motion stops, utterly. Are we to believe that all the good ideas for the new medium have been done? "/>
				<outline text="Relating to Moore's Law, why does the performance monitor on our PCs flatline near zero? Meanwhile a $2K machine goes from 450Mhz to 1.8Ghz in three years. Confusion. Where are we going? Why do all good ideas in software have to pass through one company? Figure it out and you understand why our growth is not tracking Moore's Law. (And it's not just Microsoft, this is just an example.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's a human problem">
				<outline text="Anyway if we want to get our economy growing at the steep rate dictated by Moore's Law, we have to change the way the tech industry thinks about competition, innovation and user choice. In many ways this is the same challenge that the US faces as we redefine our role in the world after the Sept 11 catastrophe."/>
				<outline text="We have to stop wanting to lock our users in to our way of thinking and our software. Technology &lt;i&gt;supports&lt;/i&gt; human intellect and expression, it doesn't define it. That simple fix gets us on track. We compete to delight the minds of our users, and put more software on their systems. Then they want more CPU speed, and there you go, you're tracking Moore's Law."/>

			<outline text="A California thanks-giving">
				<outline text="A joke. How many Californians does it take to screw in a lightbulb? None, Californians don't screw in lightbulbs, they screw in hot tubs. Amen to that. To me, a hot tub is an essential utility of life -- much like a shower, or a kitchen sink. So on Thanksgiving, first and foremost, I am thankful to my hot tub for being a true friend, a place of meditation, a place to slow down, and enjoy the blessings of nature, both of the world, and of our species."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, California is about more than relaxing in lovely hot tubs. We're also into spiritual development. A story from a workshop in Big Sur a few years ago. Our teacher gave us an assignment. &quot;Everyone walk around the building and let your eye wander, and whatever it falls on,&quot; he said, &quot;thank it.&quot; This sounded dorky at first, but then it got worse. For the exercise, it's not enough to just say &quot;Thanks&quot; or &quot;Thank you&quot; -- you must also say &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; you're so thankful. "/>
				<outline text="It was a life-changing experience. After the awkwardness wore off, it's actually a lot of fun, because it can get you to look at things you often overlook, and see how those things support your existence, and even better, how they can offer you new experiences, a richer more enjoyable existence. In other words, there's more to life than surviving (a test we all eventually fail). A secret to this richer experience is to unleash the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=innate&quot;&gt;innate&lt;/a&gt; human sense of gratitude." created="Thu, 22 Nov 2001 15:31:57 GMT"/>
				<outline text="There's a bug in many cultures, one that says that somehow it's dangerous to be appreciative. &quot;If I thank you, you'll punish me,&quot; appears to be a common belief. But try taking a contrarian view and see what happens, put on your lab coat and try an experiment. Practice gratitude. At first the receiver of your thanks might not know what to say or do (it's so unusual). But say thanks often enough and relaxation sinks in, on both ends. "/>
				<outline text="People say they're thankful for this or that, but when do we say thanks &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; that which we are thankful for? A bug, perhaps, revealed? (So let's try to fix it.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A demo">
				<outline text="A few months ago, relaxing in my living room with a friend, I told the story of my teacher and the thanks-giving exercise. My friend asked for a demo. "/>
				<outline text="So I took a deep breath and started thanking all the things on the coffee table. Thank you pen, for giving me a way of recording my ideas. Thank you glass of water for cooling me off. Thanks to the magazines and Lego toys for helping my mind idle. Thank you to the deck of cards for giving me a way to play with my friends. Thank you candles for the light of my ancestors. "/>
				<outline text="Then I looked up and thanked the track lights for helping me see things that I otherwise wouldn't. I thanked the books on the bookshelf for bringing me the minds of great authors. Thanks to the bookshelf for supporting the authors. I thanked the picture over the mantle for reminding me that it's OK to dream of beauty. "/>
				<outline text="It's so easy to slip in to a self-centered view of the universe, to grieve your own insignificance, but it's also easy to let your mind wander outside your body and find that there is so much to be appreciative of, so many experiences that involve others, without the grief, to learn that our little nook of the universe is very cozy and warm and lovely and wet and comfortable, if you open your mind to seeing that."/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/directory/952/thanksgiving&quot;&gt;Every&lt;/a&gt; Thanksgiving since DaveNet started in 1994, I've written an essay about the holiday, which is such a simple celebration, so inclusive, so easy to participate in. This year, in the spirit of my teacher's lesson, I'm going to wander around for the Web and take notes of thanksgiving to the people who inspire me, teach me, and give so much of themselves through the wonderful medium known as the World Wide Web.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/3/01; 7:07:45 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning technology fans!">
				<outline text="In February when I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/02/01/johnDoerrOnABicycle&quot;&gt;John Doerr on a Bicycle&lt;/a&gt;, little did I realize that Doerr was already hatching one of the most skillful rollouts in history -- Dean Kamen's Segway, formerly known as Ginger, or It. "/>
				<outline text="I've read reports in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,186660,00.html&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/03/technology/03THIN.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, and I totally want one of these, or at least a demo, soon. Is $3000 too much? Of course not. I've got my checkbook out. And how long will it be before John is riding a Segway down the street? Hopefully very soon. "/>
				<outline text="Now back on the farm we're still plugging away on the decentralized Internet, Web publishing on the desktop, and now with a new twist, we'll try to make concrete one of the most nebulous terms in computer science -- Knowledge Management."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What is Knowledge Management?">
				<outline text="Imagine you work on a development team, or at a consulting firm, an accountancy, law firm, or advertising agency. In the 80s we called these people Knowledge Workers. These were the people we made computers and software for. "/>
				<outline text="First we gave them spreadsheets, word processors, databases, outliners, presentation programs, then email, instant messaging and the Web. What did they use these tools for? To communicate, but the trail they left behind, a collection of files and folders on each user's disk, was largely unusable because the tools for finding things they left behind were so primitive. However that didn't stop people from creating volumes of knowledge, but in the back of our minds was the nagging belief that somehow all this knowledge wasn't being used well enough."/>
				<outline text="So, with that context, Knowledge Management is the process, philosophy or goal of making good use of knowledge. We've been discussing this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and the first bit of pushback that came was &quot;That's what technical writers are for,&quot; but I don't agree. So much of what we do is written, even people who aren't professional writers. I run a small development team, and when we're in the endgame of a product ship, as we are now, most of what we do is writing. There's a lot of coordinating to do, lots of checking assumptions, and these days, all of that work is written and communicated electronically."/>
				<outline text="An example, on Saturday I wrote a 6-step plan, it took about twelve hours from concept to sign-off. All writing. Yesterday I started writing the code. Lots more writing as I documented the steps, all the changes I made so people on the devteam know what to expect. Would a docs writer, working on a user's manual six months from now find this narrative useful? Without a doubt."/>
				<outline text="Knowledge Management is the art of making knowledge useful using computer technology. Now that it's not a buzzword for me, I realize that it's been a goal of mine and (flipped around) a source of frustration, for many years. We have these fantastic tools for generating volumes of writing, but what good use is all that writing long-term? That's the next challenge."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/10/01; 7:34:23 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good evening">
				<outline text="This evening I took a 10-minute ride on a Segway."/>
				<outline text="I had a helper, a guy named Mike from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.segway.com/&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; that makes it. He coached me on how to use it."/>
				<outline text="First he turned it off and had me grab the handle bars and push it forward and back. Then he had me do the same thing with the power on. He asked if I could feel the difference. I could. With the power off it was a pair of wheels with a handle. With the power on, it was active. It's hard to describe because I've never felt anything like it before. It understood something about what I was doing. There was resistance, but it wasn't holding me back, it was more like it was holding me up. He asked me to lean into it. I did, but paradoxically, I stayed upright. "/>
				<outline text="Then I put one foot on its platform then the other. It started rolling forward uncontrollably. He said stand up. I did. It stopped. Now lean back, he said. It moved backwards. He didn't have to say anything more. Forward back forward back. It's not that it reads your mind as the initial articles said, it doesn't. You learn to control it with your body motion, it's a feedback loop. At first it's awkward like riding a bike for the first time is awkward. You have to teach your mind to relax about it, and once that happens, you're moving and everything's OK, even if you don't have a clue how it works (I don't)."/>
				<outline text="&quot;How do I turn?&quot; I asked. There's a twist-to-turn hand control that rotates the wheels so you turn. Rotate all the way and you do a 180-degree turn, in place. I started moving around the room (a cocktail party, with a few other baby-stepping Segway users doing as I was) -- I came close to colliding with a few people, but somehow managed to avert disaster each time by leaning back a little and twisting the turn control. "/>
				<outline text="I spent ten minutes on it, then it was time to let someone else play. I didn't want to stop. Getting off is like taking your ski boots off after a day on the mountain. You have to learn how to walk again. It's the first time I've learned a new way of moving in a personal way, in a very long time. It's as different as riding a bike is from walking, as skiing is from driving a car."/>
				<outline text="They have all kinds of applications in mind for Segway. I talked with Dean Kamen and asked what his aspirations are. He's thinking quite big. Like a lot of instantly popular entrepreneurs the rush of fame and adulation has gone to his head. At this meeting were about 100 other people, including some formerly huge names in high tech. The one negative of the evening was Kamen's hubris, which he can be forgiven for. I'd like him to be serious, not self-indulgent, if his invention is to have the chance it deserves, he'll have to get over himself, at least a little."/>
				<outline text="They have some serious applications in mind, but I don't think they get the big app, the killer app for this product, which is that it is fun. I'm disappointed to hear that the consumer product won't ship until 2003. My advice for the investors and entrepreneur is get this into people's hands as soon as possible, let them play, so what if they don't take it seriously. There's no quicker way to success than to have a product that people enjoy as much as skiing, without the travel, without the bundling up, and without the lift lines or long rides to the top of the mountain."/>
				<outline text="Key take-away from the initial ride: It's Fun. "/>
				<outline text="I think that's all you need to know. "/>
				<outline text="I'll be writing more about the product on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in the next few days, for sure."/>

				<outline text="PS: Thanks to John Doerr for inviting me to this evening's event. He promised it would be inspiring and it was. He's a sweet man, that he would bet so big on such a wacky idea says there's hope for us. Why not give it a chance? You bet."/>

				<outline text="Well the year is winding to a close. In past years I reviewed the writing for the past year to see what I could glean from it. This year I did something different. "/>
				<outline text="Early in December I started making a list of weblogs I read regularly and sorted them into categories. I came up with a set of qualities that I value in a weblog. I like weblogs that take me to interesting places, and say interesting things about those places. It doesn't really matter what kind of attitude the person has. I like as many irascible blogs as ones that are more mellow. "/>
				<outline text="Longevity also matters. Visiting a favorite weblog is like checking in on a friend or family member. The same strings get pulled. How are they doing? Inside myself many of these people feel familiar, even though I've never met most of them face to face."/>
				<outline text="One thing led to another and this list of favorite blogs became an awards website where people can vote on their favorites, including fifteen nominees for Blogger Of The Year. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/awards/2001/"/>
				<outline text="I hope you check it out, if for no other reason than these are the weblogs that in 2001 said something important and interesting, to me. You might want to check these sites from time to time, and see whazzup in the world of weblogs."/>
				<outline text="In early-mid January we'll announce the winners, with much fanfare and adulation. But know that they're all great reads. The quality has gotten good enough that it makes sense to have awards. Nice!"/>

				<outline text="A few days ago I ran a little story on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/12/19&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, which appears in the next section. It got unprecedented pushback, much like the anti-death-penalty &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/02/04/forgiveHer&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/01/29/myUncleSam&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; around the execution of Karla Faye Tucker in 1998. I like this kind of pushback because it tells me I'm helping people think about the world in a different way. And if the events of 2001 have taught us anything, we &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; think of the world in a different way. "/>

"/>
				<outline text="It occurred to me that with the end-of-year gift-giving season in full swing, it might be a nice way for the people the US to do something nice for the people of the Middle East. I don't think the money flows to terrorists. It's just like the Red Cross in the west, they take care of people who need help. "/>
				<outline text="The first step to respect is to realize that these are real people, with hearts and brains, and like all people, it's hard for them to hate people who care for them. So I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strategicprofitsinc.com/hosted/palestinered/&quot;&gt;doing this&lt;/a&gt;. I feel really good about it. "/>
				<outline text="I got my mom to give them $100 too. Now we joke about how the Bush Administration is going to round us up. I told her I thought it would be an honor to be rounded up for giving a small amount of money to help people who need help."/>

				<outline text="Today's the last day of work for me before my holiday travels commence. I'm going down to San Diego for a few days with family, hiking and eating and catching up. I'll be back sometime on Wednesday, and then I'll be watching over Jake and Lawrence as they get Radio 7.1 buckled down, and Brent gets Frontier 7.1 ready to go, and working with Doug on a longer term project. We're starting to branch a bit at UserLand, not totally a single thread now. Partially that's due to a new piece of software we are using that is pretty revolutionary. It's not a publishing tool, like everything else we've been doing, it's a management tool. Little hints of this tool will start appearing, in fact, in the next paragraph.

				<outline text="Yesterday I posted a heads-up on the OPML-Dev &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml-dev/&quot;&gt;mail list&lt;/a&gt; that we would &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/stories/storyReader$11&quot;&gt;soon&lt;/a&gt; be announcing OPML 1.1, with a new core feature that makes it possible to receive notification of changes to an OPML file. Basically the document contains subscription information, much as RSS 0.92 &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/rss092#ltcloudgtSubelementOfLtchannelgt&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;. Lest it be said that we were not inclusive and open, to our competitors in outliner-land, please support OPML and also support the new pub-sub feature. I promise you'll be happy you did sometime in 2002, Murphy-willing." created="Sat, 22 Dec 2001 15:11:50 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Now, a few comments about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/awards/2001/&quot;&gt;awards&lt;/a&gt;, which caused such a stir in weblog-land last week. First, the awards have been a great success from my point of view, not only because they got us so much flow (they did), and not only because I found out about so many excellent sites I didn't know about before (that happened too), but also because I could see how other people see UserLand, Scripting News, and me, more clearly. " created="Sat, 22 Dec 2001 15:14:41 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I was struck by a comment about the value of some other award site, from a person named Nikolai (sorry I don't have a pointer or an exact quote). The point went like this. &quot;His awards were great because they included sites that are not in Dave's circle of friends.&quot; How interesting because I don't see our sites getting very much in the way of recognition. In all the articles written about weblogs, the sites mentioned most often are the ones that Rebecca Blood's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of weblogs talks about. Her history is taken as gospel by a lot of the working press. " created="Sat, 22 Dec 2001 15:18:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Then there was the deluge of press about Blogger. Not very many of our friends' sites got mentioned in that either, and if they did it was usually dismissive or parenthetical. The story was Blogger, not blogging. Then there was all the hoo-hah around SXSW, and their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sxsw.com/2001/interactive/webawards/finalists.shtml&quot;&gt;awards&lt;/a&gt;. Then the Webbies, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webbyawards.com/main/&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, all the blogging we do counts for naught. It seemed to me in my self-centered way (I'm just human after all) that people were working hard to exclude us. Matt Haughey, the guy who started the damning Metafilter &lt;a href=&quot;http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/1526&quot;&gt;flamefest&lt;/a&gt; (who later apologized for doing so) consistently gets great press for running a BBS. More power to him, but sheez, why object when we go for a little community-building celebration of excellence amongst &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; friends? I think by the end of the thread Matt and others understood this. "/>
				<outline text="So maybe this is a turning point for the blogging world, or maybe not. I would like it to be. Awards are by definition not inclusive. That runs against the grain of the philosophy of the Web, which is imho to be inclusive. Having been on the other side, I understand why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kottke.org/notes/0112.html#011221&quot;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt; and others resent our having awards and not having their sites nominated. I get it because I've experienced it. I see the parallel. Honestly, I didn't think they even read my site. They don't link to me, or talk about me with any respect, so I misunderstood this. I thought they weren't reading, so why should they care if I choose to honor the sites that I love. And that Matt thought that I was going to try to get the NY Times or whatever to cover the awards, reveals a very different perspective. While I am jealous when they get coverage that I don't, I see the BigPubs as doing only superficial studies of weblogging, because that's all they do of anything. If weblogs are going to grow more in 2002, we're going to have to cover ourselves. Open the doors, show your readers the other points of view in all our little cloisters. Make it bigger, not smaller. Don't be like the portals of the dotcom craze, trying to capture people in your wake and not even tell them that there's more to the weblog world. That's defeatist. It kills what we're all doing." created="Sat, 22 Dec 2001 15:21:54 GMT"/>

Let's not be scared to build on each others' work. Try whenever possible to include others in your sphere, regardless of what tools they use or who their friends are. I wasn't surprised that many people who visited the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/awards/2001/&quot;&gt;awards page&lt;/a&gt; have never heard of most of the sites on the list. Dig into them, they're all excellent weblogs. Make a new friend. Post your own awards, so we can all find out what you find excellent. But don't do it to spite me, do it to create updraft. Let's help the cream rise to the top. Let's discover new sources of inspiration and information. And if you don't like what I'm saying here, start your own weblog and set me straight, but do it with respect (that means respond to what I said, not what you wish I had said). The more that happens, the more I win, the happier I am. Truly." created="Sat, 22 Dec 2001 15:27:08 GMT"/>
