			<outline text="***Another year!"/>
			<outline text="It's 1997. Welcome!"/>
			<outline text="I liked 1996. It was a little rough. But it was soft too at times."/>
			<outline text="If the weather on the year change is a predictor, this is going to be a wet one. Flash floods and mudslides. The driving ain't easy. "/>
			<outline text="Hey if you like rain, come to California! It's not just raining cats and dogs here. Barnyard animals are coming down. Lots of them! Big ones. "/>
			<outline text="But so far the power has stayed on. 1997 has been a gooooood year."/>
			<outline text="***Freedom is good"/>
			<outline text="Lots of hands are wringing in MacLand. The mailing lists are quiet, just days before MacWorld Expo. "/>
			<outline text="This is usually not a quiet time. There's usually lots of testing and bugfixes, intrigue, deal-making, announcements, and other movement. "/>
			<outline text="It's quiet... I'm feeling free, really free to make new choices. I imagine others are thinking too. That's why it's so quiet. Shhh."/>
			<outline text="***The web is my home"/>
			<outline text="I am a web developer!"/>
			<outline text="This makes things simpler. If another desktop or server platform becomes popular with web developers, I want to make software for that platform. "/>
			<outline text="I also want to make software for platforms with vendors that are easy to work with. If they'll open the door for me, I'm more likely to go in. If they tell me to go away, I go away."/>
			<outline text="I like the web. So much room for growth. A user interface that makes VisiCalc look good. The platform without the platform vendor. A developer's dream."/>
			<outline text="***The answer for Apple"/>
			<outline text="Last year I wrote a longish piece on the New Year, anticipating a management change at Apple, saying what I would do if I ran the company. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/96/01/gottabearetha.html "/>
			<outline text="Today it's the same answer. Make the platform as relevent as possible for people who use and develop for the web. The Mac is already strong here. It can easily be made stronger."/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon!"/>
			<outline text="For the last couple of months I've been talking with Rick LePage, a longtime friend and editor-in-chief at MacWEEK, about doing some work together. "/>
			<outline text="We agreed to keep our eyes open for opportunities and this morning we found a great one!"/>
			<outline text="***Where are we going?"/>
			<outline text="Given Apple's announcements of late December which were well covered in MacWEEK and DaveNet and elsewhere, one of the hot party questions at next week's San Francisco expo is sure to be Where are you going? "/>
			<outline text="We're all going somewhere. Or are we? "/>
			<outline text="Are we going together, or are we dividing up? "/>
			<outline text="Questions questions! "/>
			<outline text="We want answers..."/>
			<outline text="***Decision 97"/>
			<outline text="So, as a cooperative MacWEEK/DaveNet project, we're conducting a survey of people who actively develop software for the Macintosh. "/>
			<outline text="We want to know what other platforms you currently develop for, and based only on the information you have right now, where are you going? Windows? NextStep? Other versions of Unix? Be OS?"/>
			<outline text="The results will be great fodder for Expo schmoozing, and for journalists who are covering the Mac developer community thru this transition, and for developers who want to know what other developers are doing."/>
			<outline text="***Call to Action"/>
			<outline text="If you're a Mac developer, please vote. Only one vote per IP address. "/>

			<outline text="Be sure to watch the &quot;News &amp; Updates&quot; page for new info."/>
			<outline text="We take a broad view of the term &quot;developer&quot;. If you write scripts or databases that others use, do multimedia content development, are a web master or network manager that develops software, please vote. "/>
			<outline text="If you don't develop software that other people use, or if you are not currently developing for the Macintosh platform, please do *not* respond to the survey."/>

			<outline text="Email is coming in asking that I share the results of the MacWEEK/DaveNet developer survey. You got it! Check this URL:"/>
			<outline text="http://ws3.scripting.com/davenet.surveyResults.fcgi "/>
			<outline text="The results are tabulated in real-time, so if you check back every hour or so, the numbers change. It's cooool!"/>
			<outline text="***Peter N Lewis"/>
			<outline text="I wrote a brief analysis of the numbers (see the next section), but Peter N Lewis, peter@stairways.com.au, beat me to it. Here's what Peter observed:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Almost no one says no to Mac or NextMac. People have no clue if BeOS is going to be successful, so it's totally  split."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The numbers for Next seem to be saying 'We'll develop for whatever Apple ships, but we're not convinced that's going to be Next.'"/>
			<outline text="&quot;The Windows numbers seem to be saying 'Yes, but under protest.' "/>
			<outline text="&quot;The Unix numbers seems to be saying 'Not unless I have to.'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Peter! "/>
			<outline text="***Selected results"/>
			<outline text="As of 7:09AM Pacific, with 626 responses to the survey, some subjective conclusions, based on the numbers so far."/>
			<outline text="Mac (System 7 and subsequent releases without Next features): 7 percent of the Mac developers surveyed say no to future development for the current Mac platform. 13 percent are unsure. A strong 79 percent say that they believe the platform for them is the one they develop for now. This is the highest yes rating."/>
			<outline text="Next (the current Mac OS with features from the Next acquisition, expected to ship in 1998): Apple will be happy to know that 60 percent of the developers plan to develop for this platform, 33 percent are unsure (second highest unsure rating), and only 5 percent say no (the lowest rating). For the most part, it appears that Mac developers intend, at this time, to follow Apple thru the NextStep transition. But only 3 percent of the developers are currently working on NextStep, compared to 39 percent for Windows, 22 percent for Unix, and 6 percent for Be. "/>
			<outline text="Windows (3.1, 95, NT): 50 percent of the developers expect to develop for Windows in the future. 20 percent are unsure, 28 percent say no. Windows gained significantly on the NextStep announcement, more than 10 percentage points. So, the second biggest winner, after NextStep, was Windows. Note that Mac went from 96 percent to 78 percent thru this transition."/>
			<outline text="Unix (Solaris, Linux, SCO, etc.): 22 percent of the Mac developers surveyed also develop for Unix. In the future, 30 percent. But 31 percent are unsure of their plans for Unix, and 37 percent have decided not to develop for other flavors of Unix."/>
			<outline text="Be OS: 43 percent of the developers are unsure about developing for the Be OS, the highest unsure rating. 6 percent are currently developing for Be, 20 percent said they would develop in the future. Be is on the rise. But their No rating, 34 percent, was second only to Unix (by a very small margin) at 37 percent. "/>
			<outline text="***Comments"/>
			<outline text="Caveats apply. Responses were accepted from anyone based on the honor system. We asked clearly, and in many ways, that only developers respond. Mac people are famous for stuffing web-based ballot boxes, but in this case, it's not clear how a zealot would vote! Interesting... Maybe this is a chance for all of us to think indepependently without getting flamed? I certainly hope so."/>
			<outline text="There were checks in the system that give us a handle on the quality of the results. Many of the voters have professional websites with real products on them. I think the quality is pretty high. The survey is certainly broader than the usual informal queries that reporters do to test the water with developers. "/>
			<outline text="There haven't been any major fluctuations in the percentages as the sample size has grown. We'll keep watching this. Maybe people are influenced by the survey results so far? Knowing what I know about how developers think, probably yes."/>
			<outline text="Our anti-spam technique, allowing only one response per IP address, had the effect of limiting response from larger companies, since many of them access the web thru a firewall. All accesses appear to come from a single IP address, even though different people are responding to the page. For example, the lead developer of a product at Microsoft couldn't vote because another developer at Microsoft had already voted. "/>
			<outline text="Some people felt that Java should be offered as an option, but in my opinion, at this time, Java is not a platform that's comparable to Mac, Unix, Windows or Be OS. This is open to discussion, and in the future, if we run this survey again (perhaps after Apple's announcements on Tuesday) we may include Java as an option."/>
			<outline text="One of the servers maxed out in the early going. Next time I'll remember to do server maintenence *before* the hits start coming. It's been pretty intense, but now I think the server is running smoothly -- it stayed up thru the night without supervision. Do Macs make great database servers? Only if you know what you're doing (and if you remember!)."/>
			<outline text="It was a secret ballot. There's no way to tell who responded how. But there's no rule that says that I can't tell you how I voted, so here goes. I currently develop for Mac and Windows. Future plans -- strong yes for Mac and Windows. Unsure about NextStep, other flavors of Unix and the Be OS."/>
			<outline text="***There's still time to vote"/>
			<outline text="The survey will run thru the weekend, so if you want to vote, there's plenty of time."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/misc/devSurvey.html "/>
			<outline text="Many thanks to MacWEEK for their support and ideas! And thanks to www.mactech.com, www.macintouch.com, Guy Kawasaki, and the members of MIDAS for helping to spread the pointer. "/>
			<outline text="***Survey URLs"/>
			<outline text="As part of the survey, we asked people for URLs of web pages that describe their products. Periodically I'll sample the list and post it at the following location:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/misc/devSurveyUrls.html "/>
			<outline text="It's interesting reading! The Mac software market is more diverse than many reporters say it is. Since developer support is often the issue raised by industry analysts, it's great to see that the Mac OS is well supported by developers all over the world. "/>
			<outline text="***=20s"/>
			<outline text="If you're seeing =20s at the end of every line in the email version of DaveNet, please send me an email letting me know. I've been getting some reports, and trying to figure out why this is happening. "/>
			<outline text="About a week ago I had to trash my Eudora Settings file, and re-entered all the settings. That could be the root of the problem. I've been over it fifteen different ways, and can't figure out where in the process the wierd line-endings are coming from. "/>

			<outline text="DaveNet is a great resource! Yesterday I asked how to get rid of the spurious =20s  and 24 hours later I know the solution. "/>
			<outline text="If you use Eudora on the Mac, be sure to turn off the &quot;May use quoted-printable&quot; checkbox in the Settings window. I don't understand what it does, nor do I want to (please) but leaving it turned on adds the =20s and turning it off gets rid of them."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Sell What You Have&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/5/97; 10:48:13 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I have a couple of extra hours to write this morning after closing the MacWEEK developer survey, freezing the numbers and graphs, and distributing the scripts."/>
			<outline text="1361 total responses, and two unmistakeable conclusions. Many current Macintosh developers would be happy to continue developing for the Macintosh OS as-is. And if the story is good enough, many will follow Apple to NextStep. "/>
			<outline text="Looking at the numbers graphically, it's clear that the only difference in the way developers feel about NextStep is a doubled Unsure rating. The No rating for both platforms is a tiny 5 percent."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/surveys/97/jan2/ "/>
			<outline text="Spend a few minutes with the numbers, let them sink in, and remember your conclusions. We're going to do another survey next week to test the developer waters after Apple tells its story at MacWorld Expo. The new survey will probably start on Thursday or Friday."/>
			<outline text="***Promises &lt;a name=&quot;jlg&quot;&gt;aren't&lt;/a&gt; as exciting as delivery"/>
			<outline text="I remember a conversation with Jean-Louis Gassee in 1989, when he was head of Apple's product development. We were talking about the scripting software I was developing, which eventually became Frontier. "/>
			<outline text="We also talked about HyperCard, which was then the most powerful scripting software for the Macintosh. I said (of course) that our software would be much more sophisticated than HyperCard, more for geeks, but simpler, deeper, faster, more useful. Jean-Louis encouraged me to tell him more. I did. I like talking to JLG because he likes geek talk."/>
			<outline text="So then he asked me a question that I still think about. He asked, &quot;Would it be all right with you, if in the meantime, we continued to sell HyperCard?&quot; I laughed! I'm laughing now. It's a funny question!"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; I said; secretly wishing that he would immediately lose interest in HyperCard, and commit fully to my new system scripting design. I'm just a human being, looking for the easier path, for me, of course."/>
			<outline text="His question is still teaching me lessons, and looking at the history of Apple, which is anything but Sell What You Have, it seems, based on reading tea leaves, that we are probably going to get a chance to learn more about this next week."/>
			<outline text="***Sell What You Have"/>
			<outline text="I think Jean-Louis was fair in insisting on staying faithful to HyperCard and its users. We may have had better technology, but we hadn't delivered. We also had to overcome HyperCard's popularity in the marketplace. He wouldn't grant us Apple's attention until we delivered. Right on."/>
			<outline text="Unfortunately, Jean-Louis was never fully empowered at Apple, and the deeply-ingrained Apple way to do things is to hype the future -- massively and with passion. "/>
			<outline text="The list of promises is legendary -- ProDOS, The P-system, Apple II Forever, Lisa, Macintosh, 1984, AppleTalk, LaserWriters, Lemmings, Taligent, Kaleida, Claris, heli-cars, AppleMail, eWorld, Newton, OpenDoc, CyberDog, Copland, NextStep. "/>
			<outline text="Some of these promises delivered, but most of them didn't. That's just the way it is with software. It doesn't say anything bad about Apple to say that they tried new ideas that didn't make it, either as technologies, or in the market. But, it is a basic business mistake, I think, to not observe this trend, and account for it in future marketing. "/>
			<outline text="The odds that NextStep will gain traction, no matter how good the developer numbers, and no matter how good the Next people are, the odds are still against it working. Look at the track record. If you're a betting man, as I am, bet on the things that work, and hedge on the ones that haven't delivered yet."/>
			<outline text="My father taught me that the best algorithm for predicting the weather on Day N is to predict the same weather as Day N-1. The meteorologists that use this algorithm (none do, it's insulting to meteorology!) get it right more often than those who use fancier algorithms. Applying the same logic to software, I think if people use Eudora, Netscape and WebSTAR in 1997, that's probably what they're going to be using in 1998 too."/>
			<outline text="There's a cost to selling against the installed base, it makes it harder for developers to raise capital to grow and build service oriented businesses that keep customers happy. Lots of users want lots more support. I hear that every day from the Frontier community. But when the attention is focused away from what's delivered, investors are unsure, and when they're unsure, they don't invest. "/>
			<outline text="Now back to Apple. What do they own, that's worth anything, other than the Mac OS and the base of software that runs on it? My opinion, nothing. They're just like Be. My bet, if I were Apple -- make the Mac OS work. Start building relationships around it as if your company depended on it. Cut everything else. Pay the price now. It's time to really work together, to invest together, compatibly, not cross-purposes."/>
			<outline text="My opinion, of course."/>
			<outline text="***A message for Amelio"/>
			<outline text="So, on the eve of MacWorld Expo, I'd like to send a brief respectful message to Gil Amelio, the chairman of Apple Computer, and to anyone that's going to evaluate Apple's new direction. The message is simple."/>
			<outline text="It's best to sell what you have. "/>

			<outline text="A lot of people asked why Muhammad Ali was there yesterday. My little kid, the one inside me, was inspired. I'm the greatest! Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. I remember and admire the young Ali. He's still there, pretty and arrogant, and right! "/>
			<outline text="I think it was a great move. Symbols are memorable, words fade. I'll remember sitting four rows back from the Great One for the rest of my life. "/>
			<outline text="***Steve Jobs"/>
			<outline text="I also think I'll remember the return of Steve Jobs, for different reasons. No one asked why Jobs was there yesterday, but I'll answer the question anyway. It's a transition. Jobs, the father of the Next operating system, passed off to Amelio and his team, for better or worse. It's out of his hands now, and that's appropriate. "/>
			<outline text="He gave the standard Next pitch, one final time. Now comes the struggle, as his team, lead by Avi, negotiates the real deal. What will the new Mac OS look like? We have some pictures, but lots of boxes need filling in. "/>
			<outline text="Developers who think on their feet, who move quickly and are flexible, will find that they can play a significant role in the attempted revival. Power is up for grabs if you're powerful. Vaccuums everywhere you look. Steam! Cooool."/>
			<outline text="Lower the pressure, and water turns into steam at a lower temperature. In a vaccuum all there is is steam. "/>
			<outline text="***The developer story"/>
			<outline text="So, if you're a Mac developer, wanting to invest in Apple platforms in early 1997, which API would you develop for? I asked this question at yesterday's press conference. The answer was on the right track, but it wasn't the answer I wanted to hear. "/>
			<outline text="Apple's CTO, Ellen Hancock, hancock@apple.com, said that if you're shipping a product in 1997, you should use the Mac OS APIs, but if the shipment is planned for after that, she believed that the Next APIs are the way to go."/>
			<outline text="More flexibility than Apple of the past. During the last API transition, from System 6 to System 7, believe it or not, Apple asked developers not to ship products at all! &quot;If you must...&quot; they said. Ohhhh. Not a good thing for a platform vendor to say to developers. It spoils all the fun."/>
			<outline text="Hancock's answer was better, but the best answer would have been: &quot;We're delighted that you're investing in an Apple platform. Look at all your options, make the best decision for you and your customers. If your market and technology are well-served by the features of System 7, by all means, use those APIs. If it makes more sense to use the Next APIs, go for it. Either way, we support and thank you for your investment in our platforms and for your trust of Apple.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It's important that the platform vendor not take a side counter to the interests of its developers. We're sentient beings, our realities add a lot to the mix. Some would say they're everything! So if a developer chooses to stay with System 7, as many will, it would be a good idea for Apple to align their interests to be compatible with such a choice."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, Apple is listening well now, so I'm confident that we will be able to get this worked out in a positive way. "/>
			<outline text="***Sun"/>
			<outline text="Jim Barksdale from Netscape, Kim Polese of Marimba and Eric Schmidt of Sun all appeared on stage in support of Apple. They were all great -- positive statements for the future, an assurance that the Mac will be well-supported by companies with high PE ratios. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of headroom -- shared with the platform with collapsing ceilings. This is good, very much along the lines of what I've been asking for. Let's work together. We're all more powerful if other people are empowered. Let's have fun! I say (and have said many times) and that sentiment was echoed in the presentations from Barksdale, Polese and Schmidt."/>
			<outline text="I was lucky, during the press conference, I sat across a small aisle from Schmidt. We exchanged whispers and I got a better picture of how compatible our interests are. I gave him my phone number. I want to visit Sun and see how we can create better connections between Mac web developers and Sun's Java and server platforms. A Solaris version of Frontier? Yeah, I'd like to see that happen. Better system support for Java code? Makes sense to me."/>
			<outline text="Power is where you imagine it. The world can be reshaped, if you want it to. "/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;hugForGil&quot;&gt;A hug for Gil&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="The final bit of theater for this DaveNet. "/>
			<outline text="I'm on the show floor. Schmoozing. One group on my side of the aisle. Another group gathered around Kim Polese, on the other side of the aisle. We're laughing! It's fun. Coool. Down the middle of the aisle comes a big entourage. A TV crew and lots of PR people with notebooks. Gil Amelio is leading the entourage. "/>
			<outline text="Gil talks to Kim. He finishes. I shout his name. Gil! He comes over. We shake hands. I sense this man wants hug. So... I give him one! Even I'm amazed that I did it."/>
			<outline text="Hey, I never felt like giving John Sculley or Steve Jobs a hug. Like Larry Ellison, they radiate energy that says stay far away. Amelio radiates a different kind of energy. I don't think he bargained for the kind of attention that Apple gets. When he first took the job, I wondered if he knew what he was getting into."/>
			<outline text="I watched him on stage yesterday, carefully, as everyone did. Personal computer technology is clearly not his thing. He stumbled and rambled. In contrast to Steve Jobs' well-rehearsed pitch for Next, Amelio is a neophyte in this world. But Jobs' pitch is so ingrained, there's so little flexibility or creativity in his position. "/>
			<outline text="From my point of view, we can work with Amelio. It's worth another shot. What does it cost us to give it a try? Hey -- the man received his hug. He even gave back, with a smile. "/>
			<outline text="It was all captured on TV. Maybe they'll post a QuickTime movie of it on the Apple website. If they do, I'll point to it from the News &amp; Updates page."/>

			<outline text="In yesterday's piece, &quot;Steam!&quot;, I suggested a position that Apple could adopt that would make for more a comfortable relationship between Apple and Mac developers. "/>

			<outline text="She said: &quot;I agree... and wish I had said that... Thanks.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yeah it's a new attitude. Apple listens and responds. Apple groks the subtleties. Understands that developers have interests of their own. This is good. It's respect. Thank you Ellen."/>
			<outline text="***Another realignment"/>
			<outline text="Just when you think you understand how the planets line up, forget it, another news item comes along to throw all the cards in the air."/>

			<outline text="***Next stop Seybold"/>
			<outline text="So the Expo is over for me now, and I'm looking forward to the Seybold show in New York in April for the next gathering of the Mac crowd. We have a lot of work to do between then and now, but there will be a new story for the Mac and related platforms. The web publishing systems story is just unfolding. "/>
			<outline text="The ideas I talked about in &quot;Watch This!&quot;, 5/15/96, are reaching maturity. Rendering, templates, macros, link management, connections to other apps. The geekish tools that connect graphic people with the multitudes of writers. The human capital we call a website. "/>
			<outline text="Add a LAN. Different systems for different users. Shhh. No one knows what kind of computer is in the closet. It could be a Be. It could be a Mac. It could be a Sun. How do you spell Enterprise? W-e-b-s-i-t-e-s."/>
			<outline text="I'm finding that the Watch This! pitch is being received well in the places that make sense. At first in May, I thought I might have had it wrong. Now I know we were early. Coool. We're using the extra time to port to Windows. Next stop...? Here we come. The Mac is the birthplace. I'll never forget that. "/>
			<outline text="Interesting times! The publishing community used to be smaller. But every organization with a website is a magazine. And they will all need publishing system software. "/>
			<outline text="***Peter Gabriel"/>
			<outline text="Artists like Macs. It's hard to switch. Bill Gates says it takes about a year to change platforms. I remember that, and experience it. The more dug in you are, the more digging out you have to do. The people who use Macs today have good reasons to use them. The software they need is there and not on other platforms. Their files are there too. As are their braincells. You forget that you know where the menus are and how selection works, until you switch to a different machine."/>
			<outline text="Gabriel uses a Mac. I don't know if Apple paid him to be on stage on Tuesday. I hope not. I imagine not. I imagine what it must like to be a creative person, just wanting to be sure that the Mac moves forward easily. They must feel the frustration as Apple has missed the easy plays, opportunities to fill vacuums, to create more powerful art."/>
			<outline text="***My little entourage"/>
			<outline text="Before the Expo I got in touch with Apple PR, to arrange to attend the keynote session. They responded enthusiastically and the red carpet rolled out. A wonderful scene resulted -- ushered thru a huge crowd on Tuesday morning by an Apple evangelist, Jordan Mattson. &quot;Make way&quot; he said. &quot;Who's that?&quot; people asked. &quot;That's Dave!&quot; someone hushes. I smile from ear to ear!"/>
			<outline text="My little entourage moves thru all the barriers. On the way I spotted Sinbad, the famous movie star who does HBO specials and movies with Arnold. &quot;Come along!&quot; I said. He did. Our wake was strong enough to pull a big movie star along."/>
			<outline text="It was fantastic theater. I felt like an artist, a celebrity. It's great to be celebrated. "/>
			<outline text="***Here's a secret"/>
			<outline text="People who make software can be as creative as musicians like Peter Gabriel if you let us be. Few people question that when I write DaveNets I am being creative. I also write software. Same person, same sense of humor."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday an Apple person thanked me for making ThinkTank and MORE and Frontier for the Mac. I accepted graciously. He said I was a god. I said not. Please! That takes the fun out of it for me. "/>
			<outline text="But let's understand something else, I am an artist, as Gabriel is. The tunes I weave are in docs and in C and in scripts. My software makes me laugh. The elegance is subtle. You have to look to see the subtlety. People find so many reasons not to look."/>
			<outline text="Frank Cassanova may be an artist, he certainly looks like one, but he isn't the only one. Want to understand how developer relations can work? Facilitate. Open doors. Welcome the artists back. Artists like vacuums. You don't have to understand everything they do or say. "/>
			<outline text="***Ben is back"/>
			<outline text="I chatted last night with Ben Waldman, benw@microsoft.com, a longtime DaveNet subscriber, and a former member of the Mac community who's coming back."/>
			<outline text="In the late 80s and early 90s Ben was the main technical liason between Microsoft and Apple. He made the perfect foil for the animus between the two companies. Ben appeared arrogant, but I think appearances can be misleading. Ben was very young then. Now he's more mature, I am too, and he's running an important group at Microsoft, and he's back doing Mac software. Welcome!"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft made a big deal about Ben's new group, based in Redmond. 100 people, 1/3 of the Office Team. They've split them off to focus on doing productivity apps for the Mac platform. I asked Ben why put so much focus on the Mac? It's only five percent of the sales of the Office product. Microsoft execs have told me over and over that they can't afford to devote very much attention to the Mac platform. I also know how preciously Microsoft allocates their human resources. So why allocate so much to the Mac?"/>
			<outline text="It's a mystery to me, but I won't look a gift horse in the mouth. I'm glad that Microsoft is pushing for more Mac software. Lots of questions. What about Rhapsody? Ben says let's have a transition that preserves his investment. Keep evolving the Mac API so that Mac apps running on Rhapsody can access the new features on a gentle upward ramp. I agree totally. "/>
			<outline text="Reading tea leaves, it appears that there has been a deal between Microsoft and Apple, or Microsoft is moving into position to make such a deal. I know how much they wanted a bundling deal for their web browser. They must be offering something in return. I also know how much Apple wants continuity for Office. We may be looking at the quid pro quo for a browser bundle? I'll keep digging and let you know."/>
			<outline text="No matter what, it's good to welcome Ben back, a little older, with more experience, and still a very very bright dude."/>
			<outline text="***I will be assimilated?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;How much time do you spend writing DaveNet?&quot; This is the question all Redmond-based Microsoft people ask me. Even more interesting: only Microsoft people ask me this question. Ben asked yesterday. Last year it was Pete Higgins, Jon Lazarus and Mike Maples. Every time I meet a Microsoft person, I get asked this question."/>
			<outline text="It puzzles me. Why are they so interested in this? And why only them? Maybe someone from Microsoft can shed some light. My theory -- I think they're trying to grok me. Should they fear my software? If I'm spending a lot of time writing, perhaps not. That's fine. A friend, a recent hire at Microsoft, says they are the Borg. You will be assimilated! I think the question is part of the assimilation process. If so, I can help."/>
			<outline text="The answer I want them to hear... When I'm writing DaveNet pieces, I'm learning about the web. Everything I learn is eventually incorporated into my software. It's why my tools can do things that no one else's can, and why they are so relevent to writers. Look at the new features coming in Frontier 4.2. You'll see the needs of web writers reflected in these geekish tools."/>
			<outline text="I know this is a challenge, and it might be trouble for me, but I think Microsoft still doesn't understand what websites are about. I also think the answer is all around them, just waiting for them to grok it. If one Microsoft exec, someone they trust, would stop everything and do something like DaveNet, hit the speedbumps, they'd understand why it's so important to me to both be a web writer and a web tools developer. Or come see me, I'll show you."/>
			<outline text="My belief: you can't make relevent software for an activity you don't do yourself. Back in the 80s when I was pioneering presentation software I became an enthusiastic presenter. When I was promoting application-level scripting I made it my business to write lots of software that drives apps. "/>
			<outline text="I am lucky. I love to write, and the web is a perfect medium for writers. I also love to make software, and I can do a pretty good job of designing templates, separating form from content. I wear all these hats with comfort. Lucky guy! Win-win-win."/>
			<outline text="For another perspective, see &quot;A Custom Cookie-Cutter&quot;, 12/17/96."/>
			<outline text="***The second survey"/>
			<outline text="The first Mac developer survey, held between January 2 and January 4 was a great success. I learned so much more about the Mac development community. Now I want to learn more, and of course you can too."/>
			<outline text="The second survey will happen on January 14. It will be open for 24 hours, between 12:01 AM thru 11:59 PM Pacific time on the 14th."/>
			<outline text="The survey form is already on the web. It's OK to point to it before the survey. Please do."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/surveys/97/jan14/ "/>
			<outline text="***Changes"/>
			<outline text="The Java virtual machine will be included as a platform choice in the second survey. This is distinct from the Java programming language, which can be used to write non-VM software. If you choose to develop for the VM, you're writing software that can run on lots of native operating systems, on a standardized virtual machine, following the model that Corel is pioneering. Java VM was a much-requested choice after the first survey, so we're offering it as a choice for the second survey."/>
			<outline text="The survey will be sponsored by MacWEEK and DaveNet. We're working with Apple to get a link from their home page over the weekend and on survey day. We want their support. After Hancock's statement yesterday, Apple has a clear interest in knowing how developers are moving. So Apple's support will be appropriate, relevent, and appreciated."/>
			<outline text="***Cookies -- Prefs for the web"/>
			<outline text="Perhaps the most controversial new thing in the second survey will be the use of cookies. Some people have a problem with cookies -- I say it's time to get over it. "/>
			<outline text="Cookies are a very useful and good thing. They allow web applications to have persistent storage. They allow CGIs to remember stuff from session to session. In this case, we'll remember how you voted in the second survey, so if there's a third survey we can easily measure changes on a person-by-person basis. Were Unix developers more likely to switch to Java? Were Mac developers more likely to move to Rhapsody? "/>
			<outline text="You say you don't want your computer to remember stuff about you? Oh come on, it happens all the time. Look in your Preferences folder. What do you think all those files are? They're cookies!"/>
			<outline text="If you want this feature from legendary software, why wouldn't you want it from web-based software? I think the press has been irresponsible about this, many of the writers know better, but feed the paranoia. "/>
			<outline text="The problem with cookies is that they have a quirky name. Mysterious. They sound like something new. If Netscape had called them Prefs and stored them in the Preferences folder, no one would have been shocked. But they called them cookies, and people are mystified and scared."/>
			<outline text="Cookies are not evil. They aren't a good mechanism for snooping. Much better -- your IP address goes with you everywhere you surf. Did you know that? I think I could set up a website that, by watching where you go, I could find out what kind of clothes and cars you like. I could even find out what kind of sex you like! "/>
			<outline text="Cookies are not a forum for insidiousness. They're a way of managing preferences. If I'm missing something please let me know."/>
			<outline text="***January 14"/>
			<outline text="So have a great weekend! And on Tuesday, if you're a Mac developer, you'll have another chance to make your preferences known."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Note that I used the word legendary in place of legacy. I like it better. More positive, more respectful."/>
			<outline text="PPS: The killer word in this piece is animus. Look it up. It has two meanings. Both are interesting."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: The Borg is a mythical civilization on Star Trek. They assimilate other civilizations! A collection of assimilated civilizations. We assume they're not nice people, but the Hugh episode showed that even the Borg can be individuals and good friends if we're open to the possibility."/>

			<outline text="Here are my comments on the results so far."/>
			<outline text="It appears that the Mac OS (System 7) platform took a major hit last week. The No vote for Mac changed from 5 percent to 18 percent. The Yes and Unsure votes are equally decreased. However, while the trend is down, 70 percent of the developers plan to continue with the Mac OS."/>
			<outline text="There's a substantial increase in the No vote for Windows too, changing from 30 percent to 43 percent; and a decrease in the Yes vote, changing from 49 percent to 35 percent."/>
			<outline text="We were looking for a change in the Be votes, and it's there. Fewer developers are Unsure. Its Yes vote changed from 18 percent to 29 percent. The No vote is in the same range as before, so most of the switches came from the Unsure category."/>
			<outline text="It's interesting that today's Next vote looks much like the January 2 vote for Mac OS. 77 percent of the responses said Yes, 15 percent were Unsure, only 5 percent said no."/>
			<outline text="Current Mac developers are very interested in Java. Java is included as a platform choice this time but it was not offered as a choice in the first survey, so we can't look at changes. 53 percent said Yes, 36 percent are Unsure and 8 percent said No to the Java VM platform. "/>

			<outline text="Be sure to check out the Changes page, the Numbers page and look at the bar chart."/>
			<outline text="***What I see in the numbers"/>
			<outline text="Developers got a clear message from Apple last week -- they're serious about transitioning to the Rhapsody platform. Many developers are going with them."/>
			<outline text="Developers are more sure about the Be OS."/>
			<outline text="The three platforms with positive-shaped curves are Mac, Next and Java."/>
			<outline text="Developers, for the most part are supporting Windows or not. A small number are unsure about whether they will develop for Windows."/>
			<outline text="***Next time"/>
			<outline text="I don't want to do another survey for at least a month. This one was trouble. There was a spam attack that started after 7PM, shortening the survey by five hours. Next time we want to have a panel of qualified developers, including small ones and large ones, in-house and corporate developers -- a broadly representative group, but with controlled participation. "/>
			<outline text="This time it was possible to spam the survey, to stuff the ballot-box. It was also easy to weed out the spamming. This wasn't an election, it was an attempt to gather some numbers. I think the survey was successful. But I'm fairly sure that if we do another survey using the current method that we will get meaningless numbers. The spammers have discovered it. Once the box is open, you can't close it."/>

			<outline text="Heard in a boardroom: It's going to take a few years, but the whole industry is going to switch to Java. &quot;Why?&quot; I ask. &quot;So this can never happen again.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The quote, which will remain unattributed, refers to the incredible confusion surrounding the Mac platform, and the position that Microsoft holds in desktop operating systems. "/>
			<outline text="***A Big Tree Falls!"/>
			<outline text="When a big tree falls, sunlight shines on smaller plants and they get a chance to grow. "/>
			<outline text="People who developed Mac software as their only business are making software for other platforms. People who have had to compete with Microsoft in the apps business find new partners to help sell products to large corporate customers on different terms. "/>
			<outline text="A new concept appears -- &quot;native operating systems&quot;. They provide the balance for the virtual OS that everyone is interested in -- the Java virtual machine -- the bridge to the inevitable (real) Java machine that will make sense when the base of Java software is deep enough to justify its own hardware."/>
			<outline text="The next generation of powerful software will have a native component and a Java component. After that, fully-Java software, assuming the hardware arrives that can run such software at acceptable rates."/>
			<outline text="Publishing systems are replaced by web publishing systems. The Seybold crowd still uses Macs. Publishing systems are built out of AppleScripts. They worry! We hear them. What to do?"/>
			<outline text="Stability is wanted quickly. Stability can come from other places. Stability is a profitable business. Nature abhors a vacuum. The software business too."/>
			<outline text="Back to the trees. Some of the stability is going to come from newly exposed small plants that used to live in the shade of the big tree. And nearby trees will spring new branches to capture some of the newly available sun. "/>
			<outline text="***Java as a scripting platform"/>
			<outline text="I have a dream! I grok scripting systems, having invested the last eight years in the task of building my favorite scripting environment. Focus focus focus. I'm definitely a focused dude. Hmmm. OK."/>
			<outline text="I understand that scripting is much more than a language. To make real things happen you need easy access to operating system functions, the ability to drive apps, a full suite of development and debugging tools, a multi-threaded runtime, gateways to server software and databases, user interface design tools, and a persistent storage system to hold scripts (reusable code) and shared data. "/>
			<outline text="Sample scripts, a framework for sharing scripts and know-how, mailing lists and bulletin-boards and developer conferences."/>
			<outline text="Script writers are different from C developers. The Java community is making tools that make sense for C developers. There are other markets that need a scripting environment. (Hint: web developers.) They like the idea of Java as a scripting language, not as a replacement for C++."/>
			<outline text="I learned a long time ago (four years) that insisting on owning the language is a good way to get developers to freeze. It's much better to add value to any language they choose. Leave the language choice with the scripter. Java is a comfortable choice for many of them."/>
			<outline text="***Powerscripters"/>
			<outline text="There are three groups of people involved in the scripting market, on any platform, in any year, using any tools -- app developers, script writers and powerscripters."/>
			<outline text="App developers create interactions. Complex stuff requiring years of training and committment to very very hard work in a competitive world."/>
			<outline text="Script writers. People who manage systems or networks or websites or groups of users, customizing the systems, building applications out of system functions and commercial apps. They're at the front line. They understand the human systems. Every organization is different. Lots of secretaries fit into this category. They have the time and the patience to learn, and they understand the organizational issues. Librarians turn out to be big end-user script writers too."/>
			<outline text="Powerscripters. They connect the two worlds. At the intersection of any scriptable product and script writers, we need people who have a systems background, deep talent and committment, people who are driven to learn and grow. The success of our scripting platform has been largely due to work of powerscripters. But people we work with in the app developer world don't understand this relationship, and that limits what we can do. "/>
			<outline text="On the Mac, it's remarkable that the app developers have done so much to support scripting. But they tend to reveal the full functionality of the product when only a simplified subset will ever be used by real world scripting apps. I'm a commercial developer myself, and understand the mindset. I want to expose everything possible. It's easier to sift thru a hundred APIs to find the one you want, than to work around a missing API. That's the app developer view of things. But this approach doesn't serve the script writer very well. "/>
			<outline text="When I'm writing scripts I want to get the job done quickly and I like elegance and simplicty. Then I want performance and systems that don't break when things change, as they always do. I like it when someone has anticipated my needs, when the road is paved ahead of me. Only a powerscripter is going to be able to provide that kind of streamlining."/>
			<outline text="***I love the Mac"/>
			<outline text="I know something about myself now that I didn't know before."/>
			<outline text="My professional family is the world of the Macintosh. I feel an affinity for other people who identify with the platform. If no one had ever used the Mac, I wouldn't feel this way. But this association has brought some of the most intelligent and creative (and stubborn!) people into my life. It's our work together, the creativity that we share, that's so important to me."/>
			<outline text="That's where the hug for Gil came from. Hey people who loved the Grateful Dead didn't care when Jerry missed a note. That made it more real. The platform will live forever, even if they stop making Macs. I'll be a Mac developer even when my software ships on other systems. That seems obvious to me now, even if it didn't before."/>
			<outline text="In my earlier pieces, I shared my frustration with Apple, but I always cared for the Mac. I'll do my part. I don't feel like a parent, but I do feel like an uncle. We're not finished shipping Mac software. We'll keep going as if nothing was wrong, and hope that becomes a self-fulfilling belief."/>
			<outline text="***Moving on"/>
			<outline text="When Jerry Garcia died in August 1995, I wrote the most poignant of several eulogies that have appeared in DaveNet. I was glad I wrote it because it put a marker in my life. I will never forget how I felt that day because I have a perfect time capsule that brings the feelings back. When it's time to move on, I like to read this piece. "/>
			<outline text="An excerpt follows..."/>
			<outline text="***On the death of Jerry"/>
			<outline text="There was nothing rehearsed about Jerry Garcia, and that was his charm."/>
			<outline text="The Dead culture was designed to survive Jerry's death. He told us not to worry about his soul. So I won't."/>
			<outline text="If I had known he was going to die I would have listened to his music more carefully. "/>
			<outline text="Like the big tree that fell last March, the death of a huge human being like Jerry Garcia frees up a huge amount of space. Once there was a tree, now there are seedlings. After the sadness, there will be huge creativity. "/>
			<outline text="Appreciate, respect and celebrate every person you can. Now is the time to have fun! Tomorrow they may be gone. "/>

			<outline text="Gooood morning!"/>
			<outline text="OK baby, here we go -- another DaveNet piece!"/>
			<outline text="And another software release... Frontier 4.2/Mac. "/>
			<outline text="Yeah we're back to normal, still in MacLand, still learning, and (naturally) still diggin!"/>
			<outline text="***It's the people, dummy"/>
			<outline text="Our community is what's important. Even if Apple were to stop making  Macs, in the interim, we still want more and more people to manage websites with our software.  It's the people that count, not machines. Lots of important people use Macs. "/>
			<outline text="When I saw what Apple was doing with Rhapsody I wanted to move into the space they were vacating. Now we're there. In this release we finished some important Mac business, and we're keeping the cross-platform stuff moving. The Windows port is going well. We're looking at other platforms. "/>
			<outline text="That's the philosophy. The Mac software business is hitting bottom. If you take a positive view, which I like to do -- there's nowhere but up from here. We get to put it back together in a more sensible way. "/>
			<outline text="If not, onward!"/>
			<outline text="***The command-line of the Mac"/>
			<outline text="Willie Sutton says he robs banks because that's where the money is. "/>
			<outline text="We're pumping up the System 7 Finder because that's where the users are. "/>
			<outline text="Think of the Finder's menu bar as the command-line of the Macintosh. Remember how powerful those Unix and DOS command-lines are. Why? Because they're open. You can add your own commands to those operating systems because they have command-lines, and many people do. "/>
			<outline text="Along came graphic operating systems, and all of a sudden the users are presumed to be dumb. The Finder's menu bar is tiny. It's not open. Lots of room. "/>
			<outline text="***Why can't I add my own commands?"/>
			<outline text="Exactly. So that's what we did. We added over thirty new commands to the Finder's menu bar, important stuff like single-keystroke folder mirroring, backups and site management. Finder-level connections to web browsers. You can change the type and creator codes for files or batches of files. Edit the text of any file with a single keystroke. Lots more stuff."/>
			<outline text="We brought back all the power you gave up (and forgot about) when you switched to a graphic system. Or if you're young enough, you may not have known that computers used to work this way! So the Finder's menu bar is now open to power users. Since I can add commands, so can you. It's a platform. "/>
			<outline text="With this release Frontier becomes an end-user thing. Hundreds of thousands of people can benefit from this software, would want it and install it if they knew it existed. Please help, if you can, to spread the word. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier/apps/Finder/ "/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***Steve Capps in Wired"/>
			<outline text="There's a one-page interview in this month's Wired with Steve Capps, one of the original developers of the Finder and the lead developer of the Newton PDA. "/>
			<outline text="Steve works at Microsoft now. He says there are no user interface standards for websites. He's right! Every site is a new learning experience. Designers and reviewers are too focused on glitz -- single-visit prettiness that doesn't serve the frequent user well. "/>
			<outline text="User interface standards were good for software, and the same idea applies well to websites. I've written about this, see &quot;Web User Interfaces&quot;, 4/5/96. "/>
			<outline text="I wanted to say that Steve has it right. Amen!"/>
			<outline text="***Not flying blind"/>
			<outline text="Switch gears now, from interactive commands selected from the Finder's menu bar and web user interface issues, to scripts that run in the dark of night, silently compiling statistics from a web server's log file."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/logDigest.html "/>
			<outline text="At 2AM every night a script runs on my server, producing a report listing the fifty most-read pages on www.scripting.com. It also tells me what the previous day's ranking was, so I can track changes. "/>
			<outline text="I learn a lot. I can spot trends. I can spot popular pages that are out of date! For example, I had no idea that a series of pages I wrote over a year ago about JavaScript (when it was new) were getting a lot of hits. Looking at the pages, I was embarassed, so I re-did them. I investigated and found that if you do a search for JavaScript on Alta Vista, my page comes up third in the list. That's probably why it's so popular."/>
			<outline text="Watching this report for the last couple of weeks has helped me understand how my website works. No surprise that my News page is consistently the number one page. People must be happy with the page because they keep coming back."/>
			<outline text="I also learned that my home page, http://www.scripting.com/, is a high flow page. Viewing it from a user's perspective, this is no surprise. But as the author of the site, I've always stayed away from that page. I wasn't sure what to put on it. "/>
			<outline text="Having access to the hit information has helped me focus on this page, and now I know how I want to use the space."/>
			<outline text="If you want to do keep your own Top-50 list, and you run WebSTAR 2.0 or greater, it's built into Frontier 4.2, which you can download from my website."/>
			<outline text="***Ric Ford"/>
			<outline text="Here's a great high-flow site to check out:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.macintouch.com/ "/>
			<outline text="It's run by Ric Ford, an editor at MacWEEK, one of the smartest and most respected journalists in the Macintosh business. If you want to know what's compatible with what, look to Ric. He knows, and he tells! What a service. Every platform should have a Ric Ford."/>
			<outline text="Ric's site is simple and clean and easy to parse. The home page is a News page. It's the spine of the site. There are related pages and sub-sites. They all link into this page, without cluttering it up. Come back here, every day, Ric says, and I'll show you some new interesting stuff. It works! I come back, every damned day."/>
			<outline text="***HotWired"/>
			<outline text="Look at http://www.hotwired.com/frontdoor/. "/>
			<outline text="When I was an editor at HotWired I used to complain when I got a scoop and there was no way to get the news out to people who visited our site! I was frustrated."/>
			<outline text="About two weeks after I left (it always works this way) they fixed the problem and made the home page a news page. Now the HotWired site has grown, they have Wired News and Webmonkey. Great columns. Simpson &amp; McChesney. I find it all even if I don't remember to look. Only one page to bookmark. I trust the editors to show me the hot stuff."/>
			<outline text="The HotWired site is dynamic and it works. I go back to there every day, sometimes several times a day. There's a lesson here. The home page of a website is like the front page of a newspaper. Some sites like the New York Times, take it too literally and use an image map to emulate the front page of a newspaper. I like it better when they use low bandwidth HTML. Both Macintouch and HotWired do it right."/>
			<outline text="Lesson learned. Static sites suck. Dynamic sites are worth visiting. "/>
			<outline text="A pattern is emerging..."/>
			<outline text="***A New Groove"/>
			<outline text="Like HotWired and Macintouch, I build my site around a news page too, but it's deep in the hierarchy -- pointed to from everywhere, to direct the flow to most dynamic page on the site."/>
			<outline text="As you might imagine I have tools that make it relatively easy for me to add an item to the News page. I also have a command that allows me to flow email from Eudora to a website, or to choose a file from a dialog to have it uploaded to my server. "/>
			<outline text="When I demo this stuff people say &quot;I want this!&quot;. That was a clue. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="As a software designer, I look for patterns and try to insert my software into the flow. To raise the level, hide details, empower people, simplify things. I hope that by correctly reading the patterns my software becomes more relevent and therefore more valuble."/>
			<outline text="I like to play with other web developers, link my site to theirs, to learn from them, to use their commands and scripts. If a lot of people manage sites with our software we can develop compatible tools, grow the software in 50,000 different directions, all upgrade at the same time. "/>
			<outline text="I decided to go for it, package the idea, to commercialize the suite, make it easy to do. If I can do it, you should be able to do it too. "/>
			<outline text="***The News Page suite"/>
			<outline text="News Page is a new suite, a menu of commands and dialogs, linked into our Suites menu. News Page is built into Frontier 4.2, so anyone who can use a Mac can manage a well designed dynamic website. I hope people take a serious look at it."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/newsPage.html "/>
			<outline text="***HTML Hinting"/>
			<outline text="We're doing something new in the HTML pages we generate in Frontier 4.2. It's a feature that developers can turn off. We hope they leave it on."/>
			<outline text="If you look at the source for any of the pages on www.scripting.com, you'll see a comment at the beginning of the page that begins with #htmlHint."/>
			<outline text="Contained within the comment is a list of attributes for the page. We started with things like the IP address of the server, the address of the source text for the page, the creation, modification dates, and the date the page was last built."/>
			<outline text="It's an open architecture. Pages can contain embedded information, even binary attributes, that can be read by software running on the client machine. With a new Apple Event implemented by Netscape and/or Microsoft we could bake some coool things into the pages. There's an interesting future here!"/>
			<outline text="For more info, view source, check out the #docs attribute on any of the pages. "/>
			<outline text="***It's still free"/>
			<outline text="Another release! It keeps getting better. And Frontier remains free. "/>
			<outline text="People want to know how we pay the bills at UserLand. Right now I pay the bills. I'm a longtime software speculator. I like it! We used to be quiet while we were investing. That was the old way. The new way is to do the development openly, to invite other people to invest too, in the belief that more fun will result that way."/>
			<outline text="***Thank you!"/>
			<outline text="There's lots of good clean energy in the Frontier community! It's growing quickly. Optimism and a realistic approach to software. Some frustration for sure. A conviction that we're smart, and a committment to working together. "/>
			<outline text="So please see the Credits page on the Frontier site for a list of the people who have contributed to Frontier's success or inspired us in an important way. "/>
			<outline text="And a special thanks to the members of the Frontier-talk list."/>

			<outline text="Goood Morning!"/>
			<outline text="It's SuperBowl Sunday in the USA. I'm not a big football fan. When the Niners make it, I watch and I like it. This year it's the Packers versus the Patriots. Can I get excited? Well, hmmm, no. Sorry!"/>
			<outline text="To all those that love the SuperBowl, have fun. "/>
			<outline text="I'm going skiing!"/>
			<outline text="***Quorum"/>
			<outline text="In the early 90s, around the time Mac System 7 was shipping, there was a company called Quorum that had done something remarkable and very powerful -- they made it easy for Macintosh applications to port to various flavors of Unix, including ones from Sun, HP and SGI."/>
			<outline text="But I doubted if they could really make it work, and even if they could, I doubted if Apple would let them do it. "/>
			<outline text="My first doubt was quashed, Adobe used Quorum's software to get PhotoShop, Illustrator and Premiere to SGI. I heard that Quark XPress was running on an SGI box using Quorum's stuff. "/>
			<outline text="But Apple sued, effectively shutting them down. It was the Roger Heinen era, Apple didn't want anyone else porting the Mac APIs to other platforms. I objected, but there was no response from Apple."/>
			<outline text="Quorum became a dead company with software product that would become valuble when Apple became a Unix company. And, as you know, Apple has become a Unix company. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.quorum.com/ "/>
			<outline text="***The Route to Rhapsody"/>
			<outline text="Quorum promises that the route to Rhapsody is assured. It gives Apple all the time in the world to get it right. It's a boost for the Mac OS. We should be able to produce native Rhapsody apps, not blue-box stuff, without having to move too far, or invest too much. It gives us time to work with Apple to create an easy transition for system managers and web developers."/>
			<outline text="Quorum also promises that we will be able to produce Unix versions of our software relatively easily. We want to do that, very much, to get into position behind Java on lots of different platforms. All the servers, clients, content tools could move. System managers and web developers will invest more easily knowing that app developers have the option to move."/>
			<outline text="Quorum is a good deal for the Mac development community, if the economics worked better. But first..."/>
			<outline text="***There's competition"/>
			<outline text="Altura Software, based in Pacific Grove, has a slightly different vision."/>
			<outline text="They offer Mac2Win which speeds the porting of Macintosh applications to Windows. They have announced Mac2NeXT, similar porting technology that would allow Mac apps to be ported to Rhapsody."/>
			<outline text="I've met Lee Lorenzen, the president of Altura, several times. He's a good guy, and Altura has an impressive list of products that they've already moved including Fractal Design Painter and related products, ClarisWorks, and MacroMedia Director."/>
			<outline text="http://www.altura.com/ "/>
			<outline text="***Economics"/>
			<outline text="Both Quorum and Altura have made substantial investments in the value of Macintosh software, but the economic system of the software business hasn't allowed much cash to flow into these two companies. It's remarkable that they stayed with it thru some very dry years. "/>
			<outline text="Apple saw Quorum and Altura as counter to their interests, when it was clearly very much in their interest to support them. The real legacy of the Macintosh is the API, and the right to move it forward. Quorum and Altura supported that. "/>
			<outline text="The ability to move software developers -- that, and the six-color logo, were the only things that Apple owned that had real value. Quorum and Altura were an insurance policy for the Macintosh API. Either one (or both!) help developers feel safer in betting on the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="To understand this, you have to understand developer psychology. Heinen's Apple didn't understand how our economics worked, or didn't care, so they marketed against Q&amp;A, thereby forcing some Mac developers to switch to the Windows API. Every time that happened, the Mac platform weakened, Apple lost value, we lost value."/>
			<outline text="Instead, Apple could have given Quorum and Altura a budget of $25 million per year to keep improving the technology. And it could have been provided to developers for a reasonably low per-seat price and no runtime royalty. In hindsight, the Mac platform would have weathered the storm of 1993-96 much better if these technologies had been funded and free."/>
			<outline text="An analogy, Quorum and Altura were roofs. The party was happening inside. With a strong roof, it would have been a much better party, as it turned out, because there was a terrible rainstorm going on outside."/>
			<outline text="Oh well. Live and learn!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: How different history might be if Q&amp;A had flourished. Unix people would have gotten to know Mac software. I bet Unix would have been better for it; probably Java too. We would have met each other sooner. I wish it had happened that way."/>
			<outline text="PS: There will be no DaveNets or new versions of Frontier this week. Don't worry, I'm fine, you're fine, just taking a little time off. Thanks!"/>

			<outline text="I came back with an item high on my to-do list -- to fix an unacceptable situation in the browser world, or at least expose it. An avenue that both Netscape and Microsoft are blocking. No one in the press is focused on this blockage; I hope to change that..."/>
			<outline text="***A simple hook"/>
			<outline text="I've been asking the browser guys for a simple hook into their apps, a new external link that would probably take 20 minutes to implement. I've asked Netscape for it repeatedly, for almost two years, and for almost a year with the Microsoft folks. No action."/>
			<outline text="Maybe they don't understand what I'm asking for? OK, here's what I want. A message I can send to the browser that will get it to return the source text of the page currently displayed in their frontmost window. It's sitting in memory. They've got to have the text somewhere, or to be able to quickly return it from their cache."/>
			<outline text="Maybe they don't understand why I want this? It's so that we can build systems that use their web browsers as the initial interface. So we can encode data in the web pages that allow us to build higher level systems. Yes, I know we can do a plug-in to do this, but there are already too many plug-ins, and it's too self-centered of them to require it. Of course they want the code to run in their world. But we live in a larger world, I believe."/>
			<outline text="I've been there with Apple, learned the lesson, and don't want to depend on either browser manufacturer. I trust them to look after their interests. I don't trust them to look after mine. "/>
			<outline text="Standards bodies and the narrow competition between Netscape and Microsoft make progress happen very very slowly. If neither company is willing to open their browser, then neither company has to. How quickly the web world has become just like the old software world. Slow slow slow say the browser guys. Why, say I?"/>
			<outline text="There's a solution -- do a custom browser for every data type that could conceivably be stored in a file on the net, and don't bother trying to make it work with current web browser software. Maybe that's what will happen. "/>
			<outline text="I don't like the fact that neither Netscape or Microsoft has been willing to provide this hook. It makes me not trust either of them. They're blocking progress. Maybe that's their right, but people who are waiting for more cool stuff to happen in net software should know that neither of these companies are allowing an important avenue to be explored."/>
			<outline text="I don't know why they don't do it. My theory is that they don't understand what we want it for, and probably, after reading this they still don't. So what? As computer scientists committed to being open (that's their claim), what's the problem? How long should we wait for 20 minutes worth of work?"/>

			<outline text="A short piece, in the middle of much website work, to remind everyone that Saturday February 8 is the first anniversary of an important event in our new medium -- the web blackout of 1996."/>
			<outline text="It's already history. In some circles it's not fashionable to remember that the United States government attempted to censor free speech on the Internet. I believe it would be cynical to overlook it. "/>
			<outline text="We defeated the law, even though we re-elected many of the politicians who tried to outlaw free speech in the name of protecting children."/>
			<outline text="I'm building a website that will go live on Saturday to commemorate the protest, and to serve as a monument to the spirit of free speech. To remind us that this is a worldwide community, and no political system has the power to enforce its standards of decency on the medium. "/>
			<outline text="The battle to retain our rights is ongoing. Important organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union deserve and require our support. It's easy to lose sight of the principles that we believe in, to be distracted by questions of corporate survival, of fear or greed. These are interesting issues, no doubt. But this is a creative and expressive medium and to protect its potential, unqualified free speech is essential."/>
			<outline text="I played a small role in the web blackout last year. This year I hope to facilitate, to organize more sites and help to spread the word that free speech is not an option, not something that can be traded or limited and that no compromises are possible."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/misc/blackout/ "/>
			<outline text="If you run a democracy-related site, large or small, please visit the page before Saturday and register. If you know someone who does, please pass this on. And if you value free speech, please visit the site on Saturday or later. It'll be a fascinating trip thru Internet history, if nothing else!"/>

			<outline text="I got a call yesterday from an old friend who used to work for Apple, then worked for me at Living Videotext, then went on to work at Next, and now works at Netscape. I promised I wouldn't name him. He has an excellent sense of humor, and probably won't mind that about a dozen people can figure out who he (or she) is."/>
			<outline text="Anyway. This person's perspective is very valuble and interesting."/>
			<outline text="I had missed something... The two top development people in the new Apple orgchart are both former Next people. Avie Tevanian did the software and Jon Rubenstein did the hardware. My friend asks if I think Jobs will have some influence over Apple's future product direction. Hah! Well, yes."/>
			<outline text="Also notice that Ellen Hancock was moved aside in the reorg. It sure looks like there was a deal between Amelio and Jobs. It looks like Jobs got control of the products."/>
			<outline text="***Chuck"/>
			<outline text="Another friend, Chuck Shotton, sent me email yesterday: &quot;Apple's stock price is down to $15.25. That makes the Market Cap only $1.9B. Within $100M of its cash. I wonder what would happen if Apple bought *itself*?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Technically, they can't do it without some outside help. "/>
			<outline text="But lots of other people can..."/>
			<outline text="***Mac users have a problem"/>
			<outline text="The Mac OS, according to the stock market, has zero value."/>
			<outline text="But that conflicts with our view of the world."/>
			<outline text="Another way of looking at it -- Steve Jobs could buy the rest of the company for $100 million. He has the money. If he doesn't want to spend his own money, he could probably raise it from other companies, rich individuals or investment bankers. He doesn't have to sell them on *any* value for the Mac. It's free!"/>
			<outline text="The chairs and desks, the semi-liquid assets of Apple, probably add up to more than the difference. Think of the value of the six-color logo. The movie rights to The Apple Story with Steve and Steve agreeing to stay on as consultants. Ooooh. Sexy!"/>
			<outline text="But Steve should watch his rear-end. Anyone else with a few hundred million could buy Apple too. I wonder if Jean-Louis Gassee has thought of this? John Doerr? Larry Ellison? Lou Gerstner? Disney? Jim Manzi? Andy Grove? Ray Noorda? Stewart Alsop! Pat McGovern. Mr. Son. Eric Schmidt. Bill Gates! "/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm."/>
			<outline text="Heehehehee."/>
			<outline text="***A delicious idea"/>
			<outline text="Assume that there's no immediate buyout or takeover."/>
			<outline text="Amelio continues to run the show with Jobs running the product, and presumably moving the newly structured company in the direction of Rhapsody, as currently planned."/>
			<outline text="They could spin out the Mac OS into an independent company, or give the source code to a standards body, as Microsoft has done with ActiveX. Either way, a new entity could sponsor ports of the API to other hardware, fix bugs, improve performance. "/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Breaking Rules&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/9/97; 12:02:40 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here's what I've learned in the last year about free speech and how it relates to technology and the new medium of the worldwide web. "/>
			<outline text="The web is still about breaking rules. Editors want to give us deadlines. Software companies want to own their customers. Governments want to make the world safe for children, which really means isolating them. "/>
			<outline text="These forces tend to control communication, to commercialize a medium, pave it over, snuff out individuality, catch your attention, hold it, and then destroy it."/>
			<outline text="Any editorial organization or software company could choose to jump over to the other side. Or could acknowledge other organizations that work differently. To facilitate free unedited (or lightly edited) speech. Or to define a community that empowers its developers and users instead of controlling them. "/>
			<outline text="Or they could let new editorial organizations and software companies take their place."/>
			<outline text="***Deals"/>
			<outline text="It takes a lot of deals to become president of the United States. In turn, he makes deals with people in the software and publishing industries, whose goals, as a result, may not be complementary with your goals or mine. "/>
			<outline text="It's all linked up. It's OK. Let's respect that. But let's remember that our ideas actually make a difference -- if we let them. My interests are linked up too. I need free speech in order to have free software, and vice versa. Not just free in theory, free in fact."/>
			<outline text="***John Gilmore"/>
			<outline text="John Gilmore, http://www.cygnus.com/~gnu/, an entrepreneur, a board member at EFF, a friend, and a frequent guest on DaveNet, says: "/>
			<outline text="&quot;We haven't defeated the Communications Decency Act yet. It's been appealed to the Supreme Court and will be re-considered there. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;We lost Round One (in Congress), lost Round Two (the President), won Round Three (3-judge panel in Philadelphia), won Round Four (judge in NY), and are entering Round Five with the Supremes. We could still lose. And there are half a dozen similar bills in local legislatures in various states.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="So who in Silicon Valley in 1997, will stand next to John Gilmore, a very smart and accomplished man, and call for the defeat of censorship on the Internet?"/>
			<outline text="***Who you attract"/>
			<outline text="I see a huge connection between writing essays and writing software, when you let the web connect them. I like to attract independent people to my site, thinkers, writers, webmasters, script writers, software developers. "/>
			<outline text="Other people specialize in broader audiences. That's OK. I want the most curious, high-energy, super smart people to experience and respond to my views and my software. "/>
			<outline text="Put another way, anyone can appreciate Alta Vista, Pointcast, Four11, Suck, AOL, MSN, Excite or CNN. I want to associate with people who can *invent* the next Alta Vista, Pointcast, Four11, etc."/>
			<outline text="***Listening"/>
			<outline text="Listening is still a precious commodity. Nothing's changed there. If you want to make a contribution to making the world a better place, please listen to someone today, tomorrow -- every day. Have the courage to let them exceed your expectations. "/>
			<outline text="If people don't listen to your story when you tell it, just act it out, act on your beliefs, and eventually the smart people will catch on, the lightbulb goes on, you make a new friend. This is the way functional markets, cultures and communities develop."/>
			<outline text="Some people will never hear you. That's the way it goes. Focus on the ones who do."/>
			<outline text="***Linking and playing"/>
			<outline text="How remarkable the web is! "/>
			<outline text="Websites are LANs but they are also documents. The documents we're creating today are unlike any that humans have ever produced. So revolutionary. So many barriers have been passed, have we noticed?"/>
			<outline text="The most fundamental change is the idea of linking. A link is the ultimate salute, the highest form of respect. I'm going to share my flow. We're going to listen to someone else for a moment. I'm going to trust you to come back to me. Or not. I don't want to own your attention. I want you to listen to other people."/>
			<outline text="Being a web author is to be a flow-crafter. I place my links strategically. It's like designing the user experience of a software product. Hey, the navigation bars I'm putting at the top of my web pages today look a lot like menu bars. Stay tuned, if one of the browser vendors gives us the get-source hook that barrier will totally liquify."/>
			<outline text="I like writing. I move you this way then that way. I play with your intelligence, your emotions, your humor. I play with you! "/>

			<outline text="It was right on, a little Norman Rockwellish perhaps, but still a good idea. "/>

			<outline text="No way. Apple is a legend, not a company. Two guys in a garage. Up down up down. The dreams of a generation. When Amelio finally figured it out he brought back the two guys! The man learns. But it is too late now."/>
			<outline text="Apple was pointing totally in the wrong direction when Amelio took over. I put my stake in the ground, just before Amelio took over. It's worth a read. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/96/01/gottabearetha.html "/>
			<outline text="Skip over the name badge stuff and the music. It's too late for that. Look at how I was going to structure Apple -- around developers. It was the only way forward then, and it still is. "/>
			<outline text="Apple concentrated the risk in its internal developers, its employees, and lost. Apple's initiatives, the list is famous, required evangelists to twist the arms of developers to support them. If they were the right initiatives, no evangelists would have been needed."/>
			<outline text="Software is spiritual stuff. No way you can head-trip your way thru it. Who could have predicted an Internet boom? But Apple was so into its own loops that at first it didn't notice it, then it went into denial, and then it looked inward again, when the answer was outside."/>
			<outline text="Another Police song. &quot;There is no political solution to our troubled evolution. Have no faith in constitution. There is no bloody revolution.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Amelio was the agent of business as usual. He didn't understand the context. His first year on the job proved that there was no more time when he started, and he acted as if there was nothing but time. The fundamental rules of the software and publishing industries had changed, and Amelio didn't even understand the rules of the old world."/>

			<outline text="***It's publishing, dummy"/>
			<outline text="Apple, believe it or not, was positioned to re-attain dominance in the personal computer software business in late 1994, when it seemed as if it was over (it *always* seems like it's over at Apple, btw, always has, always will). "/>
			<outline text="The web is what's happening, right? All the new initiatives, the stuff that fills the pages of the Weeks, are still speculative, right? Does the web have a lot more growing to do? Yes. Has the shakeout happened? No. It's still a long way off. "/>
			<outline text="The web is a publishing market. The technology in this market is going to follow the flow of print publishing systems. It's so simple, it's so easy to see!"/>
			<outline text="Layout, graphics, writing, publishing systems."/>
			<outline text="Where have we seen this before?"/>
			<outline text="***Layout"/>
			<outline text="Quark XPress, the installed-base leader in the layout segment of the publishing industry, will get web layout features. It's going to own the market that NetObjects Fusion is camped in, because it already owns the market. "/>

			<outline text="With Netscape 4.0, the web will get layout features. At that time, designers will use XPress to design the look of pages on websites."/>
			<outline text="***Graphics"/>
			<outline text="GIFs, JPEGs. Pretty pictures. PhotoShop is the big product in this space, but there's room for an easy-to-use text-effects graphics program. A big opportunity in the low end. A market dominator at the high end."/>
			<outline text="***Writing"/>
			<outline text="The vast majority of people involved in building websites are writers. They need excellent writing tools with spell-checkers and easy user interfaces. Programs that run on laptops, work on a small screen, text that's easily emailable and FTPable. Some support for HTML is helpful, but not crucial. The goal of writing tools is to facilitate writing, not layout."/>
			<outline text="New tools such as PageMill, FrontPage and HomePage will prove to be historic anomalies. They are not great design tools, and they are not great writing tools either. They are serving a temporary small market, they must grow in features to remain competitive, and there's no way to grow those products' functionality without becoming word processors and outliners."/>
			<outline text="Simple text editing is what this market needs. The leader, right now, by the way, is BBEdit. I think email programs such as Eudora are well positioned in this market, since they are adequate writing tools with great communications built-in."/>

			<outline text="Ask the folks at Seybold Seminars (I can't call them Seybold as many people do because I have an official capacity there now, details in an upcoming piece)."/>
			<outline text="The Mac is totally dominant in the publishing systems market. Microsoft wants to own this market, but they don't."/>
			<outline text="http://www.seyboldseminars.com/ "/>
			<outline text="It's the one big-money market that the Mac still owns. "/>
			<outline text="Let's own it."/>
			<outline text="***The strategy"/>
			<outline text="Here's what I want Apple to do. "/>
			<outline text="Shrink the hardware line down to three configurations, a desktop client, a laptop and a server. Strip the system software to a bare minimum. Buy some server capacity (I recommend ConXion, Microsoft uses them, so do I) and distribute the extra software for free via the net."/>
			<outline text="Commit to supporting the 68K for the forseeable future. To be sure this is possible, I run a modern web server, www.scripting.com, on a Quadra 850. There's no need to break this link. The publishing industry is very conservative on new hardware purchases. They want all their hardware to be useful, even old stuff. We have to include 68K machines in the plan."/>
			<outline text="Developers will put together competing toolkits for server and authoring software to be distributed on CD and over the net. Apple has proposed that they put together the CD bundles, but this is not a good idea. We need a competitive market in order for it to work."/>
			<outline text="In every opportunity Apple has to communicate with the press and users, they should tell this story. Layout, writing tools, graphic tools, publishing system software. "/>
			<outline text="Apple makes hardware systems, developers make the market. Repeat it over and over. Be patient, it will take time for it to sink in."/>
			<outline text="There are people in Cupertino who get it, who understand what the publishing market wants, and how to sell to it. Clear the path for them to lead. "/>
			<outline text="And, even though patience is required, there's no time to wring our hands, or to deploy a new operating system. "/>
			<outline text="***The story"/>
			<outline text="Here's what I want the press to do. "/>
			<outline text="Recognize that the Internet happened. Lots of Internet authoring happens on Macs. That isn't likely to change. A dislocation, a bankruptcy at Apple, will hurt lots of people, including many people in the press who use Macs. But the worst thing possible is the perpetual state of almost being bankrupt. Let's move beyond that, please!"/>
			<outline text="Write Apple off now and stick to it. Write one more &quot;the end is here&quot; piece and then go cold turkey. The movement in the net has nothing to do with Apple even if it has everything to do with the Mac. It's hard to parse the contradiction, but that's the lesson we all have to learn. "/>
			<outline text="The Mac platform is the product of a husband and a wife. The divorce is almost final. The husband's job from now on is to pay child support and get out of the way of the rehabilitation of the kid.

			<outline text="***Boca or Bucha!"/>
			<outline text="My first company, Living Videotext, was a company of many slogans, shouted in the hallway, as a method of greeting people."/>
			<outline text="One of the slogans was &quot;Boca or Bucha!&quot; We were ambitious young people with our sights on Boca Raton, Florida; the capital of IBM's personal computer operation in the early-mid eighties. We had to fly to Boca Raton a lot in those days, for meetings with stiff-shirted IBMers, who knew nothing about what we were doing, older people who seemed much dumber than people could *possibly* be. "/>
			<outline text="They were our filters. We felt that in order to be successful they had to understand what we were doing. It couldn't happen, so we were frustrated. We were going to kill IBM or lose everything trying. Boca or Bucha! I don't think it was fair for us to hate IBM, but we needed someone to be the villain. It was a long time ago. I was much younger!"/>
			<outline text="Bucha is short for Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, a small brutal country in eastern Europe. It was before the revolution, while Ceausescu was still running the country. Either we were going to do business in Boca or we were going to be taking the red-eye to Bucharest. It was all or nothing!"/>
			<outline text="Well, as luck would have it, both are history now. Boca Raton is a ghost town and Nicolae Ceausescu is dead. We beat both of them! Ye-ha."/>
			<outline text="We used to have fun. "/>
			<outline text="We still do!"/>
			<outline text="***I'm older now"/>
			<outline text="The people who run the industry I work in are my age or younger. "/>
			<outline text="I find that people respect me more as I get older. They listen more carefully when I talk. I like that! It's something that younger people can look forward to, but it's still very frustrating for them. I remember what it was like."/>
			<outline text="I look at the world and it makes more sense now. At 41, my generation is in power. We're the incumbents. We run the show. Let's see if we have something interesting to say!"/>
			<outline text="And this will change for sure, as the people running the world get younger and younger, I believe it will look wrong to me again. "/>
			<outline text="Let's see..."/>
			<outline text="***Toasters"/>
			<outline text="For many years we've talked about information appliances, making computers as easy to use as toasters. "/>
			<outline text="Toasters are nice things to have, but they are trivial. I like to make toast. It's nice, even fun sometimes. But I write at my computer. I do a lot of my thinking and creating here. I spend a lot more time at my computer than I do at my toaster!"/>
			<outline text="Simplicity implies that everyone has the same needs. In toast, that's more or less true. In computers it's not true. Computers are used for lots of things. You can create special-purpose computers by limiting options and making them less general. Maybe, if you do that very well, they are as useful as toasters."/>
			<outline text="***Jobs &amp; Ellison"/>
			<outline text="It's interesting that Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, is the latest proponent of the toaster theory of computer design. His point of view will be important because (I think) Ellison will own Apple soon. Get used to the idea, I say."/>
			<outline text="Steve Jobs will be Apple's CEO. In his opening speech, probably at the WWDC in May, Jobs will talk about the idea of computers as toasters, a vision he had in 1984, and unfortunately (so he'll say) it was too early then. It turns out, he'll say, that we needed lots of memory and disk space and a great net connection to really make a computer toaster work."/>
			<outline text="Bring your hands together in front of your mouth. Let the tips of your fingers touch. Briefly close your eyes, take a deep breath, nod slightly and smile."/>
			<outline text="Many people will like what Jobs says and how he says it. Larry Ellison will say that this is what he meant by a Network Computer. Someone from Sun will say Java Java Java. Many small developers will buy in. "/>
			<outline text="If I had to make a bet, I think Jobs will probably go with some kind of Java OS and ask for new software for his machine. It would be a risky bet, like selling Lisa in 1983 or the Next cube in 1988 or Newton in 1994. Java isn't ready to support a software market yet. Maybe in a few years."/>
			<outline text="Steve is a man of discontinuities. It worked twice for him with the Apple II and the Mac, but the world is different now. Compaq moves quickly, so does Cisco, Intel and Microsoft, as does the web development community. Steve has to negotiate with the world, to conserve power, to be respectful of others, in order to win this time around. "/>
			<outline text="A new Apple could be more crafty in putting together the next move into ToasterLand. Jobs is much more mature now too, so let's hold space for a newly directed Apple being smart and bold at the same time. "/>
			<outline text="I like to do software for geeks, it's true, but I also like to do software for poets and planners. Been there done that, can do it again. So I wish Steve a lot of luck this time around. It might be time."/>
			<outline text="***A bet hedged"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, maybe Jobs's vision won't be inclusive. And maybe it will only offer  a Rhapsody path to high-end users. "/>
			<outline text="If we're going to switch operating systems, so be it. Since we're going to move I want to go to a more stable world, not a less stable one. I think of myself as being part of a cross-platform developer community. But the contradiction is catching up with me. Is the other platform Rhapsody? We'll see. "/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, we know that Windows is growing, and our software is missing in that world, so the port continues. More digging going on for quite some time."/>
			<outline text="***A rumor"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday a wild rumor was spreading in the Macintosh net developer world. It couldn't be true! The rumor was about Open Transport, an adventure in TCP programming that Apple launched a couple of years ago. It's been a long long road for us in OpenTransportLand, but now it finally works, and it's delivering the benefits that were promised to us a few years back."/>
			<outline text="The rumor said that the Open Transport team was going to be laid off in the upcoming reorg at Apple. The new OS folks at Apple (Next) are going to take over networking software and APIs. The OT group would be disbanded, future versions would be tabled in favor of the TCP interfaces in NextStep."/>
			<outline text="I know a lot of Next people read DaveNet, so I wanted to send a gentle message about chucking Open Transport -- don't do it! We have a lot invested here. The user and developer community don't want another upheaval. Things are finally stabilizing. We won't thank you for throwing all the cards in the air, again, just as they're settling from the last card-toss."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, there appears to be another release of OT on the shelf at Apple. Please go ahead and release it. Put it on an FTP server at apple.com. I'd happily serve it from ftp.scripting.com. Let's check it out. "/>

"/>
			<outline text="It's important to actually say the words, in a personal way. Don't assume they already know. Symbols are important too. They don't have to be expensive symbols, they just have to show thought and care and most important, be an expression of love. "/>
			<outline text="This is the best holiday, right up there with Thanksgiving. It's not a religious thing, it's a celebration of our best, what we do best as human beings -- loving and caring for each other. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/18/97; 5:12:44 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="I had lunch on Sunday with Steve Wozniak, one of the founders of Apple Computer. I had never met him. The lunch lasted five and a half hours. We talked about lots of things."/>
			<outline text="I was surprised to find out how Apple-involved he is. He has a user's understanding of the Macintosh, experience using all the major apps on the platform. Steve has time to actually use the stuff. As we talked about software, we were talking about how real stuff actually works. No theories. He asks piercing to-the-point questions. No fear here."/>
			<outline text="Steve drives a Hummer, which is a military vehicle. He buys lots of toys. He's got Macs and Macs and more Macs. A great rack of servers. And boxes full of computers that he doesn't use. I salivated! I want some of that..."/>
			<outline text="He's an insider at Apple now and he's been reading my stuff for a long time, as have many of the insiders at Apple. He points out that the publishing market is a good Mac market, as I have said, but he emphasizes the importance of the education market. That market is entering its buying season right now, so Apple must get an offering together quickly, or 1997 is going to be out of reach."/>
			<outline text="One thing I learned is that he doesn't trust the press. He says that the major pubs are just out to sell papers. I don't disagree. Tis a shame, I think, because Woz would make a great spokesperson for the Mac now. There's a lot of truth to be told, and he isn't scared of the truth. We had, as they say, a frank discussion."/>
			<outline text="Back at the dawn of the Macintosh Jobs talked about computers for the rest of us. Now it seems that unless something incredible happens, we know who the rest of us are. Steve Wozniak is one of them. A good man, with a big heart who like to have fun. Not bad. I'd definitely like to be friends with him! I don't make that statement lightly..."/>
			<outline text="***Floating an idea"/>
			<outline text="There's a lot of freeware or shareware for the Macintosh. Wouldn't it be great to concentrate that stuff around a server with a high bandwidth net connection and a consistent look for the pages, with searchable archives, and a recognizable face endorsing the collection? "/>
			<outline text="I asked Steve if he liked the idea, and he offered use of his server. Take a look. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.woz.org/ "/>
			<outline text="Seems pretty zippy to me. If you're producing excellent Mac shareware stuff, send me email. Let's see if there's an interest."/>

			<outline text="***TCP scripting"/>
			<outline text="A few weeks ago Chuck Shotton, the lead developer of WebSTAR, and I got together to build a solid TCP foundation for Mac script writers and app developers. "/>
			<outline text="The goal was to provide a connection between TCP, the standard transport method for the Internet, and Apple Events, the standard way of connecting Macintosh applications and system software. Simply put, we connect the Apple Event Manager to TCP, providing reliable stream-oriented TCP connections for apps and scripts running on Macintoshes. "/>
			<outline text="We support script writers working in either AppleScript or Frontier, or mixed environments. The Apple Event interface is designed to be easily accessed from C or other machine languages. The Frontier scripting interface will be cross-platform."/>
			<outline text="The package includes a small application called NetEvents that provides the stream management code. The code was cribbed from the source code of Chuck's Pounder app. It's been well tested, is leak-free, is threaded. There have been some new features added that may have leaks or may not perform reliably. "/>
			<outline text="We both decided that we've waited long enough for the big companies to move. They may not understand what we want. We have a nice playground here -- let's explore some, and learn what it can do. That's the basic idea."/>
			<outline text="We shared this work with several members of the Mac scripting community over the last couple of weeks, and the software seems to work, and we know how we want to proceed. So it's time to share it with a wider group of people."/>

			<outline text="An exciting, fascinating, and then sad story started unveiling yesterday. "/>
			<outline text="It began with an excited phone call from a friend who has been working in Java for the last few months. He found a program on the net called Mocha that can be used to decompile Java apps. He was psyched! Learning a lot about Java by looking at the source code of apps downloaded from the net. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/computers/mocha.html "/>
			<outline text="A decompiler undoes the work of a compiler. It takes a machine-executable program and turns it into source code. For most languages, such as C or Pascal, the resulting decompiled program is quite artificial, and can't really be used to reverse-engineer the program that was decompiled. This is one of the most important ways commercial developers protect the intellectual property value of the software they distribute. "/>
			<outline text="It turns out, due to a quirk in the design of the Java Runtime system and the relationship with its compilers, that Java code can be almost entirely reconstructed, including the actual names of variables used by the original programmer! The only things missing are the comments. This is an amazing oversight in the architecture of Java. Why is it this way? I don't know. I'd be interested in hearing more."/>
			<outline text="My friend had used Mocha to decompile one of the most widely publicized commercial Java apps, so we know that the process works."/>
			<outline text="I published a link to Mocha, alongside a reference to an Infoworld article detailing a huge committment by IBM to Java. I wondered if they knew that anyone could decompile their Java code and learn all their secrets? I bet they didn't."/>
			<outline text="***There's more to the story"/>
			<outline text="I got mail from Sidney Markowitz, sidney@research.apple.com, pointing me to a C|Net article on the controversy, from back in August 1996 when Mocha first appeared. "/>
			<outline text="Sidney pointed me to a page with an explanation by Hanpeter van Vliet, the author of Mocha, which begins &quot;The Dutch have a reputation for stealing coffee. Exactly three centuries ago, in 1696, my ancestors stole a coffee plant from the heavily guarded plantations of Mocha (Yemen). They shipped it to their east-Indian colony and cultivated it into a unique and successful species that would become known as Java."/>
			<outline text="&quot;So what could be more appropriate to celebrate this than to release Mocha, the Java decompiler, this year? And isn't it apt that both the Java compiler and decompiler were written by Dutchmen? Not everybody seems to agree.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="http://java.motiv.co.uk/mocha.htm "/>
			<outline text="It's a fascinating piece. Well worth reading. Read the piece, you'll understand how he did it, and why Java is an exceptionally public programming language. Without scrambling the source code, it's impossible to keep Java source code private."/>
			<outline text="Markowitz writes: &quot;The page you gave for the Mocha decompiler was set up last August and points to the author's home page site, which no longer has an account under his name. I did some web searching and found more news about Mocha, some of it quite sad."/>
			<outline text="From the Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.java.advocacy yesterday: "/>
			<outline text="The question, &quot;The Mocha web page has gone 404.  Anyone know why?&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Johan Vromans, johan_vromans@nl.compuware.com, said: &quot;Hanpeter van Vliet, author of Mocha and owner of the page, died December 31st. He was a colleague of mine.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/95/12/whiteboywelfare.html "/>
			<outline text="***No keeper"/>
			<outline text="At the top of Apple they talk of digging out by making Windows/Intel boxes. It's serious talk. People are resigning over this issue. No Mac software will run on these boxes. Apple may still make Macs. But when they meet to decide what ads to run, they'll be betting on the Wintel stuff. How will you feel then?"/>
			<outline text="The wrong people own the Mac. They're going to kill it to try to save the company. There's a disconnect between the public story and the business plan they're creating. It's out of synch with the interests of Mac users and anyone who wants a real choice other than Windows."/>
			<outline text="There's no keeper of the Mac vision. I don't trust Steve Jobs. He brought a different operating system with him. It's not the stuff we've built on, all that gets thrown out when Apple makes its transition. "/>
			<outline text="I've heard the plan from inside Apple, not the current publicly stated one. I believe there will be no place to run Mac software, blue box or no blue box, except on old machines, ones that never get upgraded."/>
			<outline text="***Listening to the wrong people"/>
			<outline text="Last year Apple management listened to the big money analysts from the east coast who told them that they need a protected mode OS or they won't sell any computers. That's why they bought Next. "/>
			<outline text="What the analysts didn't tell them is that if it weren't the protected mode problem, they'd invent something else. There was no way for the Mac to win with them, so why did they try? "/>
			<outline text="By the way, NT 4.0 machines crash. It's OK. I think all computers do. NT is a good operating system. Many people use it. I do too. I just bought a second Dell box to run NT 4.0. Good stuff."/>
			<outline text="Does NextStep crash? I don't know. I've never used a NextStep machine."/>
			<outline text="***Listening"/>
			<outline text="Instead of listening to the analysts, let's listen to Jeffrey Veen, an editor at WebMonkey and a longtime Mac user. He drives a VW bug, a car that hasn't been made for many years. Other people take care of the VW platform. Veen says he will use his Mac no matter what happens at Apple. "/>
			<outline text="Paul Snively writes elegantly on the DaveNet mail site that the users of Infocom's Zork games have kept that platform moving forward for a decade after the disappearance of the company. Platforms go on, he points out, they have lives after the white boys get thru with their adventures."/>
			<outline text="***Being kind to the Mac"/>
			<outline text="Maybe it's time for Mac users and developers and clonemakers to make an offer to Apple and the makers of the PowerPC chip, Motorola and IBM, to separate our destiny from Apple's. I have thought about this a lot and decided that I'm in favor of anyone but Apple owning the Mac OS. Not because they're bad people -- because their interests and the interests of Mac users are out of line. "/>
			<outline text="I want a steady ride. I don't trust them. They're going to panic and dump the baby."/>
			<outline text="Instead, a new privately held company, 250 people, could own the Mac OS and license it to Apple and the growing community of clone vendors. Engineers and webmasters, keeping the system current, fixing bugs, improving performance. Distribution of add-ons thru the net. Connections with the developer community, Netscape, Be, Apple and Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="Such a company, properly managed and developed, could have a high market cap, and could quickly do a solid IPO. There's a business here -- it can't support a $9 billion company, but it could do $250 million in its first year and grow from there. "/>
			<outline text="Who would capitalize such a company? Who would make the offer to Apple, Motorola and IBM? Whoever they are, if they are interested in focusing on these goals, I would help them, and I bet a lot of others would too."/>
			<outline text="We could support Apple's Rhapsody-based future more easily if they were kind to the Mac now. I don't think they can be kind as long as it's inside Apple. I'm hoping that we can all be friends, that we can grow beyond the white boy legacy, get real, and do something positive as we go our separate ways."/>

			<outline text="On Sunday, the promise of push. The positive view. Today -- fear, the dark side. "/>

			<outline text="***Back doors"/>
			<outline text="The Internet came into corporate America thru the back door. "/>
			<outline text="Just like PCs and minicomputers before them."/>
			<outline text="The cycle repeats. The corporate wieners clamp down. Things get boring and predictable. It explodes again. They clamp down. Again and again."/>

			<outline text="***Channels"/>
			<outline text="Do you want to be a net potato?"/>
			<outline text="I'm bored with Pointcast. I was happy with it when I first saw it. But the reality was sanitized and totally commercialized. I de-installed Pointcast, with some difficulty."/>
			<outline text="One-way is not the way of the Internet. When one-way is promoted as the next wave, I see diversity being limited and control of expression being invited in. I see it as something other than the Internet. The One-Way Net? Sounds like TV! Ohhh."/>

			<outline text="***Oh push me push me"/>
			<outline text="If you say push one more time I'm going to ask if you really want to be that open?"/>
			<outline text="Hey, if you have a fulltime net connection, and are willing to open your hard disk to being pushed from strangers you're more trusting than I am."/>
			<outline text="Installing a new piece of software is an act of faith, sometimes undeserved. The other day I installed something. It installed an old thing in my System Folder without asking me. The new software worked. But now some other stuff that I depend on... doesn't."/>
			<outline text="What if they could do this without even telling me they're doing it? Sounds like nirvana to some. Sounds like a nightmare to me!"/>
			<outline text="The art of upgrading is still evolving and chaotic and in many ways, demeaning. So what if there are new pipes that can carry frequent upgrades? What silver bullet do the push proponents possess to keep things from breaking?"/>
			<outline text="***Push begets"/>
			<outline text="When real system managers with jobs to protect get their hands on push they're going to demand even more security, more isolation, even less diversity."/>
			<outline text="Who's going to assume the liability for the broken systems? How does Corel and Lotus and McAfee know what other software is running on the systems they're installing software on? And do they have the time or motivation to do the testing required to be sure that their pushed upgrade really works?"/>
			<outline text="***Trust"/>
			<outline text="OK -- suppose you work at a company. Many people do. You use a computer at the company. They own it, you don't. One more time. They own it, you don't. So if they want to install some new software on your computer, that's their right. "/>
			<outline text="And if they want to delete some software, that's their right too. Corporate standardization. Everyone uses the same stuff. "/>
			<outline text="With a push agent implanted on your machine, the network manager has the power to copy information onto your system. That's somewhat innocuous. But they also can copy information from your hard disk and put it anywhere. Anywhere. They *can* touch this! Uh oh."/>
			<outline text="You may want to keep things on your hard disk that you don't want your employer or co-workers to see. You have to trust them, it's part of your job. Inside the firewall there's no right to free speech and a very limited idea of privacy. You have to trust them... But do you?"/>
			<outline text="There's the issue. Push can be a force for more powerful systems that make computers even more effective for communication. "/>
			<outline text="Or it can be used to reduce computer networks to a uniform, flat, 1984-like world where no one dares to try out a new idea, even in private, for fear that someone who doesn't like them will know what they're thinking about."/>

			<outline text="Can't touch this!"/>
			<outline text="Wrong. They can."/>
			<outline text="***Flattening out the net"/>
			<outline text="Push is not pretty. I think it aims to flatten the net. To give the power back to the old way. I think Bookmarks are cool. I like websites. I like free-will and random behavior. Call me a Luddite if you want. "/>
			<outline text="Push is a manufactured trend, subscribed to by the conglomerates and ad agencies and cash-hungry analysts, to serve their interests; promoted by high-tech leader wannabes and opportunistic startups. "/>
			<outline text="I think push is anti-freedom. I don't dig it. Or, I don't dig the dark side of it."/>
			<outline text="If you use push to further free expression, it could be enabling and neat. But I don't think the proponents of push are thinking about it that way. I don't think they care what you say or what I say. One more time around the loop? One more time."/>
			<outline text="Remember &quot;Web Energy&quot;? The bright eyes and optimism. It was just a year ago. Now we're looking to IBM, Intel, Oracle and their ad agencies and thinking we see brilliance. No way. "/>

			<outline text="It requires a little setup."/>
			<outline text="And then blam!"/>
			<outline text="***A web that's not free"/>
			<outline text="In Sunday's piece, I was going to point to the Business Week cover story on Webcasting. It was hard to locate the piece from the home page. I used their search engine. Nice stuff. "/>
			<outline text="http://bwarchive.businessweek.com/ "/>
			<outline text="I clicked on the link, and got to a page that said it would cost $2 to read the article. Well, hmmm. OK. No."/>
			<outline text="Interesting policy! The current issue is freely available on the web, but back issues cost money."/>
			<outline text="***SJ Merc too"/>
			<outline text="I went to the San Jose Mercury-News website this morning"/>
			<outline text="http://www.sjmercury.com/ "/>
			<outline text="to look up an article that I knew would be there about Steve Jobs and Pixar and their deal with Disney. I had heard that in the interview with Merc reporter Jodi Mardesich, Jobs had denied having any official capacity at Apple beyond being an 'advisor to Gil.' "/>
			<outline text="I thought this was an interesting contrast to the posters of Steve Jobs as a young man that are popping up all over Apple corporate headquarters in Cupertino. Ooops. I snuck some news in there."/>
			<outline text="I found the story, in their business section, but it cost money too!"/>
			<outline text="Wow."/>
			<outline text="***Classified Ads for free"/>
			<outline text="The third part to the setup is the project I'm working on this week, that will open up Classified Ads serving to anyone with a Mac web server (Windows soon), so they can compete with local newspapers like the Mercury-News and national publications like Business Week. All the scripts are free. I want lots of servers."/>
			<outline text="***The fence"/>
			<outline text="So I realize I'm on the other side of a fence from the print pubs that have made the transition to the web. "/>
			<outline text="They're making it easy to compete. If you want to own the free version of Business Week, go for it. It's wide open. Same with the San Jose Mercury and every other local paper that's applying the print economic model to the web. An opening like this hasn't happened in several generations."/>
			<outline text="What amazon.com is doing to the book retail industry can be repeated in news. Most of the major websites and pushcast services are just shoveling print reporting thru their channels. They don't carry independent voices. Ask them why. I'm curious. "/>
			<outline text="A temporary dislocation.The barriers are coming down. Hire a few good reporters and cut their lead time to ten minutes. Trust their judgement. Run a few ads. You don't have to be much of a technical wiz to put up a high-flow site. Let me know. We can help."/>

			<outline text="My unusual two-piece Tuesday got me a bunch of email both pro and con. Comments on the Mail page from Louis Rossetto, Mark Canter and Larry Tesler in defense of push. And a bunch of comments on the other side."/>
			<outline text="My opinion, no one owns this thing, push, just as no one owns the web. There are no agreed-to or de-facto standards. It's not about Java or web pages. "/>
			<outline text="As it's currently implemented push is really pull. A loop you keep spinning around until you realize that all that's being done is net-enabling new clients that propose to replace web browsers. Not a big deal until a compelling new client comes along. That will be news. The protocols themselves are not interesting."/>
			<outline text="Wired proclaims on its cover that web browsers are dead, just as the web is gaining depth and simplicity and universality. Maybe that's the problem for the money people. They always want to invent a chicken to wait for the egg, or vice versa. The web is powerful and non-exclusive. And free. Oooops?"/>
			<outline text="Even so, looking to the future, I agree that something bigger is possible, but it's not here yet. More complete sandboxes on clients and servers and content stations are key. More fulltime net connections enabling peer to peer connections, not just client-server. "/>
			<outline text="An Internetish thing, not worthy of an IPO in itself, but a worthwhile investment for developers. A few years of incubation and experimentation and evolving standards, at least, will be needed before nirvana is reached."/>
			<outline text="Haven't we learned anything? Go back to 1994 and read &quot;Bill Gates Vs The Internet&quot; then read &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;.

			<outline text="The free channels are beating out pay channels in lots of areas. I believe they will always will, even after a shakeout. The free web is a reality. It's disrespectful to ignore it, yet that is what the money is trying to do. "/>
			<outline text="***Text and people"/>
			<outline text="We're in the age of text and people. The difference between $5 million sites and $5 thousand sites is the difference between graphic flash and people. The expensive sites have great animations and flashy ads. But they also have multi-day lead-times, and repurposed print writing. "/>
			<outline text="The inexpensive sites have free people and short lead-times. Some are boring free people, but there are interesting free people too. Publishing systems will deliver effortless and broadly accessible authoring with a consistent look, templates designed by designers, economically published. Flowing from email thru scripts and out to cheap-to-serve static web pages."/>
			<outline text="The only concern from that point is how to pay for it. But it's almost completely free, so stop worrying! "/>
			<outline text="But the money-raisers ask how they're supposed to make an obscene amount of money to justify their huge pre-money valuations based on nothing other than their reputations? "/>
			<outline text="That's their problem, not mine. "/>
			<outline text="***Mac publishing systems"/>
			<outline text="Owning a printing press used to be an expensive proposition. The production systems for starting a new print magazine used to cost a lot more than a Mac. That's why Macs sold as publishing machines. The premium price that Macs fetch (or used to) doesn't look as premium when you compare it to the price of the publishing equipment it replaced."/>
			<outline text="People who view it from the Intel perspective may miss the point that the Mac platform owned the publishing position for many years when Windows was an also-ran. The platform charged into the market without opposition while PCs were hobbled by RAM Cram. Read Ries &amp; Trout's Marketing Warfare for a valuable perspective. No matter how ineffective Apple management was, the platform had and still has Big Mo in publishing."/>
			<outline text="Along comes the web. The people who started with print publishing on Macs, many of them college students in the eighties and nineties, are now an important part of the world of words. The power is with the younger people. I've written about this many times. The world they grew up in is different from ours. They were ready for the web, and got there long before the people of my generation. They have a clue; in general, we don't. They have nothing invested in our ways. No upside in them. Watch out."/>
			<outline text="There's a preference for Macs in this world beyond its market share in the larger world because people who express themselves literally and graphically bought Macs when they were the only act. They like the independent image of the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="If only Apple could respect them, it would all make sense."/>

			<outline text="How to implement respect? Listen. It can evoke your fear, but it's simple."/>
			<outline text="Responsible -- another word that's misunderstood. People say Be responsible and some people hear Be dull. Other people hear Guilty. Neither is accurate, IMHO."/>
			<outline text="Responsible means &quot;able to respond&quot;. It's so much more than being defensive, a limited view of responsibility."/>
			<outline text="Being responsible also means &quot;able to accept&quot; because acceptance is a response."/>
			<outline text="But acceptance is more than respect. A response of yes is great. Fear is overcome. Thanks! Want to really have fun? Yes! More fun? YES! There's a scale here. A scale of acceptance. A scale of fun."/>

It may have been a mistake to send that out; not because it isn't true, it is, rather because the substance of the achievement is still being defined. "/>
			<outline text="***Content Servers"/>
			<outline text="A new kind of server, we call it a  Content Server, renders text according to the designer's spec, written in HTML with special mark-ups indicating where the title and body text, and other standard elements, go. The architecture is totally open, it's object oriented, properties are inherited, so you can go very deep with your tweaks. "/>
			<outline text="The publishing software does the work of today's HTML coder. It takes a process that used to be done by hand, and automates it. It makes it possible for sites that are more than brochures. Sites worth coming back to. It leverages skilled HTMLer's work over lots of pages, and over time. And it makes it easy to change the look of a site without coordinating with the writers."/>
			<outline text="It's a place for template designers to plug in their designs, for graphics people to plug in their GIFs, JPEGs and Java applets. "/>
			<outline text="The goal, stated simply, was to separate content from design and provide a framework that allows people to work together. To automatically manage large dynamic sites with lots of authors, and prepare web content for migration to new distribution methods, such as push, MCF, or whatever else might become interesting."/>
			<outline text="***Built on solid open standards"/>
			<outline text="Designers work in HTML. Authors submit their pieces via email or FTP or file sharing, using plain text tools like BBEdit, Notepad, or Eudora; or fancier editors such as PageMill, HomePage, GoLive or FrontPage. "/>
			<outline text="Writing (some call it authoring) can happen on any platform that supports email or FTP. That's everything of course. "/>
			<outline text="The standards of the Internet make it possible. The content serving software, built in Frontier, runs only on Macs. But remember, websites are LANs. Look around, you'll find a Mac. Plug it into your Ethernet, install the software and get to work! "/>
			<outline text="***Making money -- ClassAds"/>
			<outline text="We are also releasing the Frontier-based ClassAds server so these large dynamic sites with lots of authors can be supported by lots of advertising. "/>
			<outline text="I've heard some great ideas for making money with these sites. I'll share the ideas with you once the sites are on the air. In the meantime here's a hint -- imagine a commission-based ClassAds website for student housing. Oh yeah! I feel flow."/>
			<outline text="***The model site"/>
			<outline text="The key is to make it possible to manage a medium-size news/opinon site, with advertising support, with a minimum financial investment, just like the one I've been operating at www.scripting.com, except totally turnkey."/>
			<outline text="The hardware needed to run the software costs less than $5000. Designers can create low-bandwidth static sites that can be served thru a 28K modem. Or the pages can easily be served from an upstream server on a higher-bandwidth connection. "/>
			<outline text="I first wrote about this last May, almost a year ago, in &quot;Watch This!&quot;, which was a seminal piece for me. At that point we changed directions and headed into a new area, publishing systems for the web. "/>
			<outline text="The vision is partially realized in our &quot;NewsPage&quot; suite, released in late January. We're reaching the next level in time for InternetWorld on March 10, and the level after that for the Seybold Conference in late April."/>
			<outline text="***What happened with Apple? "/>
			<outline text="They're supporting this vision. The lightbulbs are happening. They're singing the same song as we. A return to the view that developers build markets and the platform vendor enthusiastically sells hardware to run the software. You'll hear Apple's story in March, and it will sound a lot like ours."/>
			<outline text="***Looking back, briefly"/>
			<outline text="That's happened before with me and Apple. The first time, with MORE, in the mid-eighties, we opened up the government market for Macs by giving the users what they wanted -- an easy way to produce presentation foils from outlines. The product was a sales rocket for us. Our revenues were too small to be noticed by Apple. But we sold a lot of machines for them and helped to build an important market. A win-win."/>
			<outline text="In the early nineties I also contributed a vision to Apple, in the form of system level scripting and interapplication communication. It was not a win-win. Apple bought into the vision, but replaced our software with theirs, ultimately succeeding in creating a sizable base of script writers, but forcing us and our software out of the market. The results of this strategy are well documented in the back issues of DaveNet, no need to repeat the stories now."/>
			<outline text="***Looking forward"/>
			<outline text="This time, it appears the common strategy will be built around our software. That's the smile behind the handshake. It's realistic and responsible to build around what we already have working. That should be our reward for having anticipated a market in time to make a difference. "/>
			<outline text="It matters less that our vision is right or wrong, if we're wrong, Apple is free to support another approach in the future. Same here. If the Mac platform continues its freefall, even with our best efforts, we're free to continue development on other platforms. "/>
			<outline text="At least at this moment, our interests are aligned. A win-win is possible. It's going to work! I feel that in my entire being. Things had to slide pretty far at Apple for them to look around and find that there's a nugget out there, a way to sell computers that they hadn't tried yet. A diamond that needs polishing. An enemy that can become an ally."/>
			<outline text="I'm very easy to spot since I'm so vocal, and have an enthusiastic and friendly group of webmasters that use my stuff, including people inside Apple. When Apple completes the survey of what the scripting community is contributing to the Mac platform, the fireworks will really start going. I, of course, am pointing them to all the hot websites. "/>
			<outline text="That's what I meant by crossing a line. There's no going back. The AppleScript-Frontier tragedy is behind us. We're solidly in the web publishing market, with Apple's support. I wanted to go forward, and we're now going forward."/>

			<outline text="Wired has a strong opinion about the web. They think it's dead. Read the cover of the 3/97 issue. I did. It made me want to puke! "/>
			<outline text="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.03/ff_push.html"/>
			<outline text="&quot;No, the 150 million Web pages now in existence won't disappear. They'll only proliferate, and at an increasing rate worldwide. We can expect a billion pages by 2000. Some of them will even be worth reading.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Sarcastic and disrespectful. An often repeated mantra these days. There's little interesting to read on the web, the story goes. I wonder if the people who say this actually read the web, because it's not true! There's lots of interesting stuff on the web. "/>
			<outline text="In the Wired editorial they side-step the issue, ask the question, it fits into a groove in my mind, they presume I know the answer. No, of course not, there's nothing interesting on the web. Until you stop and think. Well, yes, there is a lot of interesting stuff on the web. "/>
			<outline text="***It's like a library"/>
			<outline text="How to find the good stuff? When I'm feeling explorative and energetic, in the right mood, I don't mind doing a dozen InfoSeek or AltaVista searches to find what I'm looking for. Modes where I might take a detour and find something exotic or interesting. I had that experience several times today while writing this piece."/>
			<outline text="When I was a kid I loved the library. I'd spend whole days reading, browsing, looking for something to learn. Talk with the librarian for new starting points. That's how the web works for me today."/>
			<outline text="Sometimes I like to be taken somewhere. That's what Macintouch is for, and my own home page. There will be many other special interest sites whose purpose is to provide coverage to self-seeking and self-defining groups of people. "/>
			<outline text="Editors and writers, just like the old days, except the editors have no control over what's being written, and under the new ethics, they don't want control."/>
			<outline text="***Other clients"/>
			<outline text="Wired dismisses the web, I think they should check their reader's pages for a more positive view. But they also call for new kinds of browsers, and I agree. The battle between Netscape and Microsoft has left us with few places to go. "/>
			<outline text="New languages or protocols aren't the answer. Ideas for new interactions are cool, but not at the expense of the diversity of the web. HTTP is powerful enough to take us a long way. So please, no baby out-throwing with the bathwater."/>
			<outline text="***What won't you see?"/>
			<outline text="I sent &quot;Don's Amazing Puzzle&quot; out a couple of hours before this piece because it's fun and revealing and required you to use the web to get the answer, unless you're one of the few people who could see it without visiting the website."/>
			<outline text="Why do I miss half the F's? The puzzle makes me look inward. My mind is so stubborn! Even after I know why, I still miss one or two of them. "/>
			<outline text="What else am I missing? "/>
			<outline text="***An example"/>
			<outline text="When I did the Rick Smolan site last month, I went looking for a picture of Rick. "/>
			<outline text="I found a great one, Rick looking a little tired, posing with a couple of kids at a book signing. I thought it was a totally charming picture. It gave me a glimpse into Rick that I had never seen. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.detente.com/will/photos.html "/>
			<outline text="Rick made an impression on the dad, and I imagine the kids will feel a special connection with Rick and his pictures, for the rest of their lives."/>
			<outline text="Hey -- there are more pictures there now! Al Gore with the family. Getting a hug from the Bathtub Lady. Watching a Space Shuttle launch. Neat! "/>
			<outline text="A story reveals. It's worth going back to an interesting site to see what changed. Spend 10 minutes at the site. You'll be moved and you'll see what I'm talking about."/>
			<outline text="***Here we are"/>
			<outline text="The thing that's heavy about the web, unlike TV, is that it's real. A digital camera, a word processor, and some people, that's all it takes. The pages may not look incredibly great, but listen to what they're saying. "/>
			<outline text="Here we are, that's the message. There's real drama in people's lives. You don't need to watch TV to get it. Use the web. The stories are moving and true. It can take a lot of courage to keep going sometimes. "/>
			<outline text="The web may never look as pretty as TV or the movies. A guy in Indiana taking a snapshot of his kids can't afford $10 million to use the latest and greatest stuff. But his story is 10 times more compelling than anything you'll ever see on the commercial sites because it's real."/>
			<outline text="Behind the awkward interface is a real human being who didn't have his ideas filtered by committees and consultants before they appeared. The site isn't pretty, but it is elegant. Not a corporate head-trip. Lives viewed thru a page. Real lives. It's art because it comes from the heart. "/>
			<outline text="Look a little deeper than the surface and you find what's real."/>
			<outline text="That's the message of the web."/>
			<outline text="***Maggie"/>
			<outline text="I love Maggy! I always go back to her site. Watching her take the heat is funny! She's so sweet, so beautiful, so vulnerable and revealing. She grabs your heart in a totally big way."/>
			<outline text="http://infoweb.interaccess.com/maggy/0297/08.html "/>
			<outline text="She says her diary is done, but I have my doubts. She's a passionate writer. I believe the juice will start flowing again. I hope it will."/>
			<outline text="***Simulated people"/>
			<outline text="I also love The Simpsons and Law and Order. My favorite TV shows. I watch them whenever I can. Even repeats."/>
			<outline text="They're avatars. Simulated friends. Just like the agents that John Sculley and Wired dream about. They advise us how to live. Go here now! Go there! Do this. Buy this! OK. But when will someone listen to me? "/>
			<outline text="TV provides a common theme in all our lives, at once. By coordinating us, they steal our diversity and choice and contact with each other. "/>
			<outline text="So what? I love Bart Simpson, grandpa and the lawyers. I love them and I watch them anyway. I like TV. Going into a trance is OK. "/>
			<outline text="***Movies"/>
			<outline text="Check out the movie &quot;Network.&quot; Peter Finch plays a TV anchorman gone nuts. He starts telling the truth on the nightly news! He urges them to take control of their own lives. "/>
			<outline text="Go to the nearest window. Open it. Loudly, firmly and respectfully say &quot;I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="What an elegant idea!"/>
			<outline text="***Stories"/>
			<outline text="I love discovering that I have stories to tell. If it weren't for the web, I promise you, I would not be able to tell these stories. That's why I think the web is so damned cool."/>
			<outline text="The web is the ultimate story-telling medium, even better than the campfire, but different. People who compare it to TV miss the point. "/>
			<outline text="When the web is most eloquent it captures a story, tells it in a revealing way, and leaves you informed or inspired or touched, and wanting to know more."/>
			<outline text="***Editing"/>
			<outline text="I realize that some writing needs to be edited. I wouldn't do a contract without having agreement with at least one other person. I wouldn't release docs for a software product without reviewing them. Some writing has to be collaborative. That's fine."/>
			<outline text="But some writing has to come from one person. Not be tweaked or revised to suit anyone else. Some writing has to express what comes from within a single person, not two or more. Writing without compromise, for the sole purpose of communicating from inside a single person to anyone else who cares to listen."/>
			<outline text="So I disagree with Wired. Not only is the web vibrant and growing, we need the web, for what it uniquely offers -- the chance to hear from real people, not computer simulations of people."/>

			<outline text="We've been working on Apple's web presence for the InternetWorld show next week in Los Angeles. As part of the site, we'll focus on the achievements of the Macintosh net developer community. If you're part of that community, we'd like to include you, your product, and/or company in the site."/>
			<outline text="The site is designed around a central news page. New stories will be linked into that page. We'll develop new structures to fit the kind of stories and links we receive. "/>
			<outline text="It'll happen in a special news room set up at the Apple booth. We're also going to demo the software on stage in Gil Amelio's keynote. The goal is to create, in real-time, a dynamic site, with lots of cool stuff that makes people want to come back again and again."/>
			<outline text="***Apple &amp; the Internet"/>
			<outline text="Apple's new Internet strategy is built around the products created by the Mac net development community. Just by making the Mac a better net platform, you can become part of Apple's Internet strategy. "/>
			<outline text="Even if you're not attending InternetWorld, you and/or your company can participate in the web site. Do you have an announcement you'd like to make next week? Think about it. If you're not saying something to your customers and potential customers, maybe you want to? "/>
			<outline text="It's OK to create a special page for this event, with links to your products, or you can point to an already-existing page that describes your Mac net product."/>

			<outline text="If you're a marketing person in the Internet space, an interesting story is developing as we piece together the outline that represents the structure and products offered by the Macintosh net development community. I'm sharing all the information on my website as it becomes available. "/>
			<outline text="I started by making a list of the web development products that I use or people that I work with use. This list is at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/macWebMarket/ "/>
			<outline text="Then I put a form up that allows Mac net developers to register their products. This morning I started reviewing the sites. Some very interesting products that I didn't know about or didn't understand. "/>
			<outline text="As I visit sites, I believe every one should have a &quot;What is XXX?&quot; page, which explains to a total newcomer, what their product or service is. It's the first thing I want to know. It's the page I want to point to. I think in most cases this should be the home page."/>
			<outline text="I'm learning a lot about the shape of the market by just doing the categorization. There are more complete databases available (I'm pointing to them as I go) but they require me to ask questions, rather than making a presenfation broken out into categories. "/>
			<outline text="There's value in doing this kind of survey on a periodic basis. This world changes every week with new products and people moving forward quickly. The shelf life of surveys like this is very short, I think."/>
			<outline text="***What it's for"/>
			<outline text="As I said in the last piece, we're doing the news site for Apple's InternetWorld web presence. All the production for the site will be done in real-time at the Apple booth at the show. Wish us luck! Look for the News Room corner of the booth. It's coming together. It won't be seat of the pants, quite, but it will feel like a moon mission. It already does."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, an interesting picture is developing. If you want to watch it, tune into http://www.scripting.com/ over the next few days. Reload often. Then we'll jump off from there to Los Angeles, the InternetWorld keynote stage and then the Apple News Room booth."/>
			<outline text="I'll let you know, via DaveNet, when the Apple site goes on the air. With any luck it should happen sometime on Saturday."/>
			<outline text="It's going to be quite a trip!"/>
			<outline text="Dave"/>
			<outline text="PS: In Netscape, to force a reload of a dynamic page, hold down the Option key and choose Reload from the View menu. This is called &quot;Super Reload&quot; and it's an essential skill for anyone viewing a dynamic news page. Not sure how to do this on Windows or in MSIE."/>

			<outline text="So, in doing the web work for the Apple @ InternetWorld site, I have two more queries."/>
			<outline text="1. Is anyone maintaining a party list site for the InternetWorld show?"/>
			<outline text="2. I'd like to accumulate a list of Mac or cross-platform developers with Mac software with booths at the show. Please send your company name, booth number, and a brief description of what you're showing."/>
			<outline text="Send email to dwiner@well.com."/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***If the net were smarter"/>
			<outline text="Imagine something that worked like DNS, the domain name server structure that gives the net words like www.scripting.com instead of numbers like 206.204.24.4."/>
			<outline text="John Gilmore, one of the founders of Sun, wants something like this to provide access to PGP public keys. Chuck Shotton, a web server guy and AI man, talks about this kind of stuff too."/>
			<outline text="I'd like to be a user! In fact, I already am. I broadcast my needs and answers come back. The same process can be systematized and implemented in software so many more people can pose questions and get answers. "/>
			<outline text="At the client end, you'd pop up a page with some of the current questions. If you know the answer, send an email to a server. On to the next question. Bing bing bing. Not artificial intelligence, real human intelligence."/>
			<outline text="An object database with relations running at each node. A super distributed sandbox that runs on the server and the client and everywhere inbetween. Accessible to C, Java and scripting languages. A traversable hierarchy just like DNS, but instead of mapping names to IP addresses it would map assertions, and allow distributed queries from any Internet user."/>
			<outline text="You've seen a demo here on DaveNet. Someone has to step up and make the software. I'm happy to help, especially if it builds on the stuff we already have working in Frontier."/>
			<outline text="We could turn the Internet into a neural net, a knowledge database that you can traverse using algorithms, not just web browsers. "/>

I'm the lead webmaster on the project, working with Sandy Ware, Karl May and Tim Bernsen of Apple, Brent Simmons of Worldwide Power and Light, and Raines Cohen of NetProfessional magazine."/>
			<outline text="Dozens of writers will work with us on the project. The goal is to cover the news and culture of an important trade show, as it's never been done before. We hope to learn about dynamic sites with lots of authors, and put our new content server software thru a real-world field test. "/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon people! This piece was written late Tuesday night in Hollywood and edited Wednesday afternoon on the InternetWorld show floor in downtown Los Angeles. An unusual lead time and an edit process that spans two days. This piece is not a slice, it's a span. Interesting."/>
			<outline text="***Get on with it Dave!"/>
			<outline text="We've got a backlog of stories on our site, but I want to get this piece out first. So onward. Please check back again in the next couple of hours for new pictures, opinions and news."/>
			<outline text="Someone said the energy of this show is just like the energy at the early Mac shows in the 1980s. Not exactly. It's got its own kind of energy."/>
			<outline text="Walking around the floor yesterday afternoon I was tremendously excited! There will be a lot of stories at this show. Yes, I'm showing software many times at this show, but I feel like a reporter and an editor and a booth person this time. I'm getting good stories. And I really like the energy at the Apple booth."/>
			<outline text="We don't have the biggest booth on the floor, but it's a big one. It's about developers this time. For the first time in 17 years I'm part of an Apple booth. Pinch me. It looks different from this perspective. What growth! People talk about Apple getting smaller. It looks bigger to me than it ever has, because it's big enough to include me and my friends, other Mac software developers."/>
			<outline text="Apple is positioning the platform just right. Web content development. No it isn't the central battleground in the Internet. But who would choose to be in the central battleground?"/>
			<outline text="As we'll see over the next few days, the battleground, the domain of Microsoft, Netscape, Sun, IBM and the second tier, Pointcast, Marimba and the other push proponents, is a dangerous place. I'm under embargo on a couple of stories, can't write about them right now. We'll tell the stories later today and thru the rest of the week on the site."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft gets the jump"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft had the first announcement of the show. In a press conference that I attended last evening, they revealed that they had been working on a proposed standard called Channel Definiton Format, in conjunction with Pointcast, Backweb and others."/>
			<outline text="I got a heads-up call on this last week, and agreed (wearing my software developer hat) to support it. A no-brainer. Sure, we'll generate CDF stuff in our Frontier-built websites. But I don't support the statement that they made tonight. It's not the standard, or even a standard."/>
			<outline text="So much posturing. Netscape is going to do one. Marimba says Castanet is emerging as a defacto standard. This is not a peaceful land. So much fear. This is not the Internet anymore. This is not InternetWorld. It's Fear world."/>
			<outline text="***Small folk, head for the hills"/>
			<outline text="I have some advice for Marimba and Backweb and the other small startup companies camped in the push market."/>
			<outline text="Marimba has the cachet of being the team that built Java at Sun. They also have Bongo, which appears to be an excellent product and is much needed in the Java world."/>
			<outline text="Why not use their marketing brilliance and strong team to market acquired products that fill other open niches in the land of Java? A Java-implemented email client-server? A great database integrated with Java?"/>
			<outline text="Why do it the hard way? I wonder sometimes if there aren't smaller developers who would love to have their products marketed by Marimba."/>
			<outline text="Backweb says they have special capabilities on the server side that make it possible for them to co-exist with Microsoft. I don't believe. As with Marimba, they could look to the last year as a time of corporate development."/>
			<outline text="My advice -- lose the aura of platform vendor, camp in niches too small to interest Microsoft. Develop your company and gain experience marketing commercial software. Grow into the net instead of launching yourselves at a brick wall. It won't work."/>
			<outline text="Why try to play the platform vendor game? Why not grow innocuously? Hide out in a niche, build great Java apps and net apps and content tools."/>
			<outline text="Do what guerillas do. Head for the hills."/>
			<outline text="***Apple's got the idea"/>
			<outline text="What a strange world. On Tuesday morning I heard the speech that Gil Amelio of Apple will deliver tomorrow at the keynote. Such a positive statement! We support creative people. No one includes Apple in the warfare. And this is good for Apple and the Mac."/>
			<outline text="We're in quiet cul-de-sac, in a position to observe all that's going on, and to supply computers and development tools to people who are doing websites. It's exactly the right place to be. Who wants to be relevent in the warfare of InternetWorld? Much better to be relevent in the growth of the net."/>
			<outline text="A source at Apple says that System 7.6 is selling 25,000 copies per day. People are surprised at how many people are upgrading. Me too. But I bought a copy for $99. Why not?"/>
			<outline text="This suggests that the Mac upgrade business is a good one. I think the Mac platform is alive. It's alive for me. That's what counts. To me, of course."/>

			<outline text="Patti is singing about things that aren't mentionable on this channel. I go ahead and listen, and know that Patti really got it right.

			<outline text="Fifteen minutes with John Sculley, CEO of Live Picture, at the Apple booth at InternetWorld in Los Angeles. We talked in the seating area of the theater with a small crowd of people listening."/>
			<outline text="Sculley has doubts about Apple's acquisition of Next, saying that he would have chosen Jean-Louis Gassee's Be operating system instead. I wondered how he feels about Jobs coming back to Apple. &quot;It's his company,&quot; he said, &quot;he may be the only person who can run it.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Sculley was brought into Apple by Steve Jobs in 1982, and eventually became the chairman of the company when Jobs left in 1985. Sculley says that he did not force Jobs out of the company."/>
			<outline text="Jobs and Wozniak are well-known, I asked him about Mike Markkula. He described him as &quot;invisible and powerful.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Sculley was surprised when Gil Amelio was chosen as chairman of Apple. He knows Amelio. &quot;He has lots of credentials in management.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Sculley spends his weeks in California and weekends at his home in NY. Does he like the lifestyle? Yes. Is he working hard? &quot;7-by-24,&quot; he says."/>
			<outline text="Live Picture does photo-spatial imaging software that, according to Sculley, works well with 28.8K connections allowing &quot;panoramic visits thru real spaces.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Apple Changes&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/14/97; 1:33:48 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I just got off the phone with Guerrino De Luca, deluca@apple.com, vice-president of marketing at Apple Computer. At 1:30PM Pacific, forty-five minutes from now as I write this, after the stock market closes, Apple will announce changes in their product strategy and changes in the Apple organization."/>
			<outline text="I was not given the number of people who would be laid off, or the financial charge that the company would take for the restructuring. Details will be on the website, address at the bottom of this email. I agreed to a one hour embargo, so that's how much time I have to get this piece together. More real-time web writing. OK."/>
			<outline text="First I'll transcribe the notes from my conversation, and raise a few questions about the future, some of which De Luca answered and some which need to be answered next week as the dust settles from the announcement."/>
			<outline text="Apple will focus in the following areas, according to De Luca: great PCs, great OSes, plug and play, ease of use, multimedia, and the Internet. The goal is to reduce costs and be more effective in communicating what Apple stands for."/>
			<outline text="Previously Apple had 22 marketing organizations, after the reorg they will have a single marketing organization. Before the reorg, Apple had six business units for the Macintosh, after the reorg they will have one."/>
			<outline text="The result will be a streamlined product line, across all price points. The Performa line will disappear. This brand-name, according to De Luca, resulted from the need of a separate profit-center/marketing organization to have a separate identity. After the reorg, there will be a single product -- Macintosh."/>
			<outline text="In April, Apple will introduce a new entry-level Macintosh. That's what they'll call it. No more Performa name."/>
			<outline text="Mac OS 8 will ship in July. They are abandoning the idea of a twice-yearly OS release schedule. The next release after the 8.0 release will be called 9.0, its code name is Allegro."/>
			<outline text="Apple is going to stop development in several OS technology areas. These include OpenDoc, CyberDog, Open Transport, Games Sprockets, Mac OS Development Tools, speech technology and videoconferencing. AIX, Apple's implementation of Unix, will be frozen at version 4.1.5."/>
			<outline text="These technologies will continue to ship with the operating system, but will not be enhanced. Bug fixes and minor performance improvements will happen."/>
			<outline text="De Luca said that scripting is essential to the publishing industry, which is a key part of their Internet publishing strategy (I agree) and that the plans would be coordinated with developers, including my company, UserLand Software and our scripting environment, Frontier."/>
			<outline text="Newton and Claris, separate business units, are unaffected by the restructuring. No layoffs in these organizations. No changes. This suggested to me that they may be planning to sell them off. I asked about it. &quot;We're keeping all options open,&quot; De Luca said."/>
			<outline text="That's the substance of the announcement. Now for a brief discussion."/>
			<outline text="***WebObjects is a mainframe"/>
			<outline text="I asked De Luca to help me understand the positioning of Next's WebObjects platform. My concern -- will WebSTAR and other server products, and the communities behind those products, have any reason to make the transition to the Next-authored operating system? His response: &quot;WebObjects is a mainframe. The price is $25,000 per server.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I wonder if the $25K price will be justified when the Next people discover how deep and powerful an enviroment the Mac web developer community has created."/>
			<outline text="Last night I spent two hours discussing the future of the Macintosh web server platform with Chuck Shotton, cshotton@biap.com, the lead developer of WebSTAR, which I think of as the core product in the Macintosh OS server environment. We're both still confused about how WebSTAR and its community will go forward."/>
			<outline text="I asked De Luca the question about WebSTAR on Rhapsody. He said &quot;We desperately want WebSTAR. WebObjects is not the end-all on the server side.&quot; I asked if he and the Next people in Apple were in agreement on this, and he said yes, they were."/>
			<outline text="***Clones"/>
			<outline text="I forgot to ask about clones, how Apple will compete with the products from PowerComputing, UMAX, Motorola and IBM and others. Reports in the trade weeklies say that Apple is changing the license pricing structure. I'm concerned that the choices, which have become an essential part of the Mac environment, will be lessened if this happens. I'll look for more information on this next week."/>
			<outline text="***Compare Mac to Windows"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Mac is better than Windows,&quot; he said. &quot;You know that.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I actually say something different. The Mac is not Windows and Windows is not Mac."/>
			<outline text="Highlighting the differences is good for the platform. Going head-on is not."/>
			<outline text="***What about the Internet?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Mac is bigger than the Internet.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I don't agree, but I understand why De Luca may feel this way. No doubt in his world Mac *is* bigger. But my view changed dramatically in mid 1994. I see myself as a net developer. I do a lot of work on the Mac platform, and have no regrets about that choice."/>
			<outline text="***Other stories"/>
			<outline text="We're almost finished with our coverage of InternetWorld live from the Apple booth. There's a pointer at the bottom of this emai. Some great stuff."/>
			<outline text="An interview with musician Thomas Dolby. Photos from the show floor. A fantastic collaboration between a lot of interesting technologies."/>
			<outline text="There will be more to say when the dust settles, but the moon mission thing happened, lots more stuff is possible now, but comments and new software will necessarily wait till we get home and regain perspective."/>
			<outline text="Still diggin!"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/15/97; 11:44:40 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="From Guerrino De Luca, deluca@apple.com, vice-president of marketing at Apple Computer, sent yesterday, in reply to &quot;Apple Changes&quot;: "/>
			<outline text="&quot;It has been a long day for all of us at Apple, but I feel the need to get back to you today about a few factual inaccuracies in your summary of our phone call. "/>
			<outline text="Re Performas: &quot;I did say we will discontinue the Performa trademark, not the Performa line. The Performa line is in the stores and people want to buy these products. I also said that the reason we are discontinuing that trademark/brand is the confusion it generates in our customers (some customers have asked us whether they should buy a Performa or a Mac). "/>
			<outline text="&quot;The existence of separate business units (an issue for other reasons, as I told you) was not the reason of the existence of the Performa brand name. Actually, the discontinuation of the Performa name had been decided by the consumer business unit itself."/>
			<outline text="Re Allegro: &quot;I said that Allegro 'might' be called Mac OS 9, not that 'it will'. Subtle difference, but factual."/>
			<outline text="Re scripting: &quot;What I said is that there are technical assessments being worked out on how to implement scripting for Rhapsody's 'yellow box' and that we would involve the Mac developers in the discussion. AppleScript remains for Mac OS and the 'blue box' of Rhapsody."/>
			<outline text="Re WebObjects pricing: &quot;It is actually $25,000 per processor - for a multiprocessor server deployment, the price is N times $25K."/>
			<outline text="Re Mac clones: &quot;Choice is what our customers have learned to expect. And choice they will have."/>
			<outline text="Re Macs are better than PCs: &quot;Yes, I did say that, and I mean it!!! More precisely, Macs are better than Wintel PCs."/>
			<outline text="Re Mac is bigger than the Internet: &quot;I said it, and I meant that lots of our satisfied customers do not necessarily buy Mac for the net. I did not mean to say, obviously, that Internet is not a huge opportunity for the Mac. I am not dumb.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;The OpenDoc Lesson&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/17/97; 12:11:35 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="For such a young woman, Alanis Morissette has a deep understanding of life. She sings &quot;You live you learn.&quot; Right on. Smart people structure their time, as much as possible, to flow new experiences thru their lives. More living, more learning. It works that way in business too. If you want to understand a market, dive into it. Become a user. Feel the glitches. Learn. Change the code. Do it again."/>
			<outline text="***The Moon Mission"/>
			<outline text="We went to the moon last week. There were glitches... As the editor of the Apple newsroom project at InternetWorld, I wanted the copy to arrive on my desk, not as finished web pages, but as finished copy, already thru a copy-edit cycle. I'd like to be able to assign priority to the new piece. If it becomes the top story, my scripts would automatically insert its headline and lead paragraph on the home page of the site and link to the full story on another page."/>
			<outline text="http://apple.www.conxion.com/newsRoom/ "/>
			<outline text="The reverse-chronologic view of the site seemed to work, but I saw some excellent pieces drift towards the bottom of the page, being displaced by pieces that I felt were less interesting. But I learned to trust the readers to be willing to scroll down a little."/>
			<outline text="Next time I want the server in the booth with us. I want a monitor that's visible to the audience that shows the server log window, and also a nice bar chart that's updated once a minute, with the hourly hit reports. Another page on the site that allows everyone to see which pages are getting the most reads. "/>
			<outline text="Conxion did a perfect job. The FTP link was smooth, page rendering happened faster on a server that was hundreds of miles away from the booth. The connection was faster than the LAN connection to the server that's less than 20 feet away from me right now. I guess AppleShare could be faster?"/>
			<outline text="I want to do audio next time. My interviews were more revealing than I could report. Perhaps people wouldn't have said as much if there was a microphone between us. But I think I can put people at ease, and help them get their story out, and help them say newsworthy things. I think next time, when we have audio, the show will be more interesting."/>
			<outline text="I had a good flow going with Tim Bernsen of Apple, the photo editor on the team. The QuickTake cameras worked well. But I want a scripted connection between a camera and the web. One click to get a snapshot onto the site. Then we could flow hundreds of pictures thru the site instead of the dozen we did this time. I got a bunch of email during the show from people who said &quot;show us this!&quot; I wanted to. But we had trouble pulling it off."/>
			<outline text="We met a lot of Apple people at the show. We acted as a team, with respect and enthusiasm, for ourselves and each other. Our managing editor got seriously ill during the show. She's OK now, we love her, but the show went on anyway. People filled in and we did the best with what we had. "/>
			<outline text="We're learning. I've never worked in a news room before. Once before I was part of a real newspaper, during the San Francisco newspaper strike. I started a student newspaper, the Daily Planet, at Bronx Science in the early 70s. All the experiences of the past served me, nicely, but the new experiences that are waiting are also exciting."/>
			<outline text="***Is DaveNet authoritative?"/>
			<outline text="I've wondered why my stories aren't considered authoritative by the business and trade press. I haven't asked this question before. I think one of the interviews at the Los Angeles show raised the question very concisely."/>
			<outline text="I interviewed John Sculley, the former chairman of Apple. Of course I wanted to steer the conversation towards Apple, the current management situation, to report something that might be newsworthy, relevent to the kinds of stories that are running in pubs ranginging from Fortune and BusinessWeek to MacWEEK and InfoWorld. I understand that Sculley had his own objectives for the interview, and I tried to accomodate him, to let his story come thru too."/>
			<outline text="Given our differences in the past, it was remarkable that Sculley gave me the interview. I was a Mac developer when he ran Apple. I was openly critical of many of the decisions he made, especially competing software projects such as HyperCard and Taligent. I was not a supporter of Sculley's Apple. But we put that behind, on the day of the interview I was a reporter, and he was a business leader with a story. "/>
			<outline text="After a brief talk about NetObjects, where he serves on the board, and LivePicture, where he is the CEO, the conversation turned to Apple. I was curious to hear how Mike Markkula figured in the running of the company. I asked what he thought of Gil Amelio. And then I asked about Steve Jobs. He answered all the questions, with some revealing and interesting quotes."/>
			<outline text="A couple of weeks ago, there was a wave of press over comments made by an ex-Apple CFO, Joe Graziano. He was an insider, for sure, but his comments weren't as interesting, I thought, and he was never chairman of Apple."/>
			<outline text="So, there are many DaveNet readers who are business reporters. When I get a scoop like this, I would like it to be taken seriously, as seriously as you would take it if it came from a print pub. Yes, we only do web stories here. But sometimes we get an important one. "/>
			<outline text="After I wrote this, a friend called to say that Tom Abate of the San Francisco Examiner had referred to the Sculley interview in his Sunday column. Thanks Tom!"/>
			<outline text="***The OpenDoc lesson"/>
			<outline text="Last week Apple cancelled further development of OpenDoc along with several other technologies. I've written about OpenDoc many times. We can now close the OpenDoc loop. "/>
			<outline text="When a developer chooses to invest in a technology, all factors must be considered, including the likelihood that the proponents of the technology will see it thru. There are no absolutes. It was impossible to tell for sure if OpenDoc would gain traction, and if it had the unwavering support of Apple. So we had to make a judgement call."/>
			<outline text="My call -- Apple was headed for trouble. It was over-extended, doing expensive software projects that were too speculative. I believed that the economics would catch up with them, and an expensive project like OpenDoc would be a likely casualty. Many people responded to my pieces about OpenDoc with a defense of the idea. But the quality of the idea or its implementation aren't the only issues, not even the main ones. "/>
			<outline text="As OpenDoc rolled thru the Mac developer community, I didn't see my friends changing directions. So I believed I knew that it wasn't going to happen, and I said so. I got a lot of flames for this, so be it, no big deal. But, if I saved some other developers the effort of implementing OpenDoc parts by stating my position publicly, then it was worth the trouble."/>
			<outline text="Now that the loop is closed, many developers are speaking up -- saying that it wasn't a good investment in the first place. The real lesson of OpenDoc is that it would be better to have the courage to speak up earlier, so the loops can be shorter, decisions can be made more quickly. The same is true when we decide to go ahead and make an investment. Let other people know what you're doing and why. "/>
			<outline text="People are so worried about having their feelings hurt. Product managers at Apple would punish us for our independence. Let's save time and money and be more effective, let's be adults, and communicate our directions to each other. And thank people for letting us know what they're doing, instead of seeking retribution."/>
			<outline text="***Let's do it again"/>
			<outline text="Here's where I'm at on platforms as of March 1997. We're rooted in the Mac, porting to Win32, hope to go to Solaris, and are interested in going to Rhapsody. We can fill the need for scripting and publishing systems on all these platforms. "/>
			<outline text="About Rhapsody, we're concerned about its memory requiremenents, and think Apple has a big job in front of it, and that we'll be shipping into System 7 and System 8 installed bases for quite some time. "/>
			<outline text="About Solaris, it appears to be the most respected Unix system, and we want the people who use Solaris to have the option of developing servers and content systems with our software. Most important, we want the respect of people who work in Unix, and are willing to port to Unix to get it."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;The Struggle to Stay Wizzy&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/19/97; 9:23:11 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Let's unwind and relax a little."/>
			<outline text="These sure are confusing times in the Mac business. For example, when PC WEEK does a summary of the winners and losers in the Apple world, why do they leave developers out? Yet at the same time, they set the goal for Apple -- get more developers and keep the ones you have. A disconnect. Isn't anyone paying attention to see that there's consistency? Since the press sets the agenda for Apple, don't they have a responsibility to think it thru?"/>
			<outline text="Talking with Dan Gillmor at the San Jose Mercury over the weekend, I asked the same question. When you judge Apple, dead or not, and the Mac, viable or not, why do you include developers in your analysis, on the negative side, but not on the positive side?"/>
			<outline text="Some developers are more even viable than the platform vendor. After all, Microsoft develops for the Mac, and no one talks about Microsoft going out of business. We make assumptions about Microsoft's behavior in the Mac market, but then don't look at the facts. They're leading in a lot of areas in the Mac net platform. Why discount it?"/>
			<outline text="Other developers are leaders, like Adobe, Quark, Netscape and Macromedia. They can provide what Apple doesn't have enough of, the ability to move developers. They have a lot of power when it comes to defining the platform. Hey, an Apple computer without their communities isn't much of a platform."/>
			<outline text="Other developers supply breakthroughs, taking huge risks on personal visions. Why not include them in the big picture? "/>
			<outline text="John Warnock of Adobe took a shot at Rhapsody in MacWEEK. He asked what we're all wondering -- should we go with Apple on this trip? Adobe has made its point. Rhapsody is a big step."/>
			<outline text="Yet the Mac has a life and life goes on. It's now clear that most of the software assets built around System 7 live outside Apple. It's going to cost a lot of money to move those apps to new APIs. Where will the money come from?"/>
			<outline text="***Geeks at war"/>
			<outline text="Leaders in the Unix world are more openly arrogant about the Mac OS. &quot;It was a bad idea in the first place,&quot; they seem to be saying. &quot;We're going to fix it.&quot; They think that because AppleShare is slower than FTP that we don't geek the web. Uh huh. "/>
			<outline text="Geeks at war! Man. Ohhh. Why can't we be friends? We look at Unix. They look at our stuff. We see databases. I don't know what they see."/>
			<outline text="Apple has always had a hard time selling what it has. Projecting into the future, seeing something much better over the horizon, but failing to notice that the table in front of them is filled with treats and wonders and seated around it are simple citizens hoping to make a few bucks selling software. De Luca gets this, but what about the rest of Apple? We'll see."/>
			<outline text="For Mac developers who are looking forward to the day when they can have thriving businesses in this land, the hopes are growing thin. Like Warnock, we looked at Next, and decided no. What changed? "/>
			<outline text="Is there a solution to this puzzle?"/>
			<outline text="Stay with me..."/>
			<outline text="***The Apple view"/>
			<outline text="I take it for granted, talking with my developer buddies, that Apple screwed up big in the last few years. The Internet was happening and Apple was ignoring it. That's our story. Never questioned, never challenged."/>
			<outline text="But there's another view. Apple wasn't ignoring the net, they were paying attention, but they didn't know what to do about it. "/>
			<outline text="The big casualty in the onslaught of the net is wizzyness. It's an anti-wizzy environment, it's in the genetics of the net to not be wizzy. Scripts, HTML, databases, Java. Netscape isn't as high tech as OpenDoc. Not a wizzy design tool in sight. And the net is stubborn. It resists attempts to make it wizzy."/>
			<outline text="But the Mac launched as the computer for the rest of us, wysiwyg was the rule. It was written into the canons at Apple. Inviolable rule. If it isn't wizzy it doesn't belong on our platform. "/>
			<outline text="You can't judge this as right or wrong. We all have rules about the evolution of our products. You can't make and market a product without having strong opinions about its character. Otherwise you're everything to everyone, you can't cooperate with anyone, and longterm that's a failing strategy. You have to stand for something and you can't be alone forever."/>
			<outline text="Apple wasn't wrong. I find it amazing that I can say that! They had their point of view, and their struggle, and it took a long time to let go. It's not at all surprising."/>
			<outline text="Anyway."/>
			<outline text="***The faceoff"/>
			<outline text="Here's the problem -- in addition to being the computer for the rest of us, the Mac is also an inexpensive and easy way to get a machine with lots of RAM, a big screen, and a big hard drive. A workstation. One that you can buy at a computer store or thru mail order. One that a lot of other people use. It's been there for about ten years."/>
			<outline text="Even geeks who love a command line like to play visual games. So you live with slow file sharing, a constantly changing interface to TCP, build your websites, geek out, even if Apple didn't want you to. "/>
			<outline text="Because a Mac is just a computer, it can be perverted in a billion ways. But much of the web stuff is geekish, not wizzy. Ooops."/>
			<outline text="Disconnect. Disagreement. "/>
			<outline text="Everyone hide!"/>
			<outline text="***Where we go"/>
			<outline text="We stop hiding."/>
			<outline text="Follow both threads. Make the Mac deeper as a workstation. Feed the geeks. And we encourage the people who make wizzy editing tools to make them wizzier, and (here's the key point) develop new high-level connections between the wizzy tools and the geekish ones. "/>
			<outline text="This totally fits into our vision of large dynamic sites with lots of authors. The authors use classic Macs, like the new lovely PowerBooks, and use friendly tools. When they save their text, it goes into a database to be rendered thru templates and a database. There's no change to the user interface."/>
			<outline text="We already have transport mechanisms that go over the local net. Let's hook the Apple Event interface up to TCP. Developers have to stop betting on Open Transport. OK. But the Apple Event culture is deep. Let's use that, or a derivative of it, as our cross-platform communication transport. Same API for communication with other apps running on the same machine. A huge performance boost is possible (the Apple Event Manager is slowww)."/>
			<outline text="When Unix geeks sneer, show them what your software can do. Do they have CyberStudio, Fusion, FileMaker, HomePage, PageMill, and all the cool stuff in the pipe? No. They have great database connections. Very nice! Let's leverage all those wizzy tools to flow text and pictures and designs thru those great data storage systems. "/>
			<outline text="We're ready to commercialize this stuff now. No more experiments needed. That's where we all meet. Soooon."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Wysiwyg stands for what you see is what you get. Wizzy is a cute aphorism for wysiwyg. What's an aphorism? Check it out."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Do they have DaveNets on Unix? If so, I'd love to meet the people."/>

Too many head-trips to be sustained much longer, I think."/>
			<outline text="***Empowerment and trust"/>
			<outline text="The more I go forward and learn, the more I believe that empowerment and trust are the two key concepts in the technology business. "/>
			<outline text="Things work when you trust and empower others. It doesn't work when you attempt to control your own destiny. "/>
			<outline text="I think this is a basic (pointless) struggle of humanity. People try to attain exclusive power, but only gods have that kind of power. Humans who try to elevate themselves to god status are always disappointed. "/>

			<outline text="When I was a teenager I did sound work for rock bands. I liked it, I'm a geek, but I dig music too. I was hanging out with the band one day, and asked the rhythm guitarist to explain what he does. "/>
			<outline text="He played a few chords, demoed all the strings. When he got to the top string, the lowest frequency one, he said &quot;I almost never touch this one.&quot; A puzzle! &quot;Why?&quot; I asked."/>
			<outline text="He pointed to his bass player. &quot;That's what he does.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Ahhhh. Interesting."/>
			<outline text="***Working together"/>
			<outline text="I look at my software friends and I see a band. Some do great design tools, something a visualist can use to design a template for each page in a website. "/>
			<outline text="I see software that makes TCP connections happen. I see databases and writing tools. We agree to share a community, so our products become relevant to each other."/>
			<outline text="When we decide to implement something that someone else asks for, even if we don't understand why they need it, that's trust and empowerment. It's the leap of faith, the jump into the unknown, and freedom and fun. Technology can be a roller coaster! No one wants to ride on a whitepaper describing a roller coaster."/>
			<outline text="Like the go-it-aloners, I want to be elevated. But I bet that the only possible elevation is the lift you get from working with other smart, creative, hardworking people. There are no shortcuts."/>
			<outline text="***A religion"/>
			<outline text="I belong to the Church of Working Together. It's my religion. I've invested hard cash in the canons of my church. I bet that knowledge and experience and software can flow around traditional barriers, ignoring intranets and corporate structures and other firewalls. "/>
			<outline text="The religion predicts a great nirvana. A router that runs on a personal computer, directing flow thru apps. A place where the wires meet. A little Internet inside your PC. It's a coool idea."/>
			<outline text="***See the difference?"/>
			<outline text="I first realized the need for this kind of software in a speech given by Bill Gates in the early 80s. The issue was integrated software as it was being promoted by Lotus's Mitch Kapor, the lead developer of 1-2-3. "/>
			<outline text="Gates suggested that a suite of single-purpose apps connected with a scripting language would make more sense than Kapor's all-in-one software. I nodded my head. A decade and a half has passed, and I still agree. Emphatically! Because I have been living in that land for five years and it works."/>
			<outline text="Gates imagined a scripting system that connects Microsoft apps and Lotus imagined their own scripting system, as did WordPerfect and Borland and everyone else. They all belonged to the Church of Going it Alone."/>
			<outline text="I was thinking about a scripting system made by someone who doesn't make apps. Someone you can trust and empower. A scripting system where all apps, no matter who owns them, can share the cursor, and become toolkits to be combined in any way a net developer wants. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/23/97; 6:23:31 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Oh I wish the New York Times didn't have a password-protected website!"/>
			<outline text="If you haven't already gotten your password, go ahead, because there are two great opinion pieces on their website, both relating to Push Technology."/>
			<outline text="The first one, which ran in Sunday's magazine, is from James Gleick. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/web/docsroot/library/cyber/week/032397gleick.html "/>
			<outline text="He says: &quot;Push is the silliest piece of puffery to waft along in several seasons. In fact, Push is nothing more than a thinly disguised return to ideas of information delivery that the Internet has made obsolete. The failure of Push is preordained.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="After a Sunday spent in the garden, it was great to read such a light-hearted condemnation of the current head-trip of the software industry and the business press."/>
			<outline text="Then this morning, a column from Denise Caruso, also about push. She says &quot;Shoving information down our throats does not increase our capacity for it. If anything, it engages our gag reflexes.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Another great quote: &quot;And this is supposed to be desirable? As Daffy Duck so eloquently puts it, 'Shoot me now!'&quot; "/>
			<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/digicom/032497digicom.html "/>
			<outline text="Thank you Denise! And thanks to the New York Times for having the guts to go counter to the hype."/>
			<outline text="***A question"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Empowerment and Trust&quot;, I said &quot;The Internet isn't a platform, it's a rebellion. This epiphany is well-documented in the early issues of DaveNet. It's still true today, even though we're looping thru FUD and NIH once again. The cursor will loop around to rebelliousness again, I'm sure of it. Too many head-trips to be sustained much longer, I think.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Gary Rieschel, gary_rieschel@zd.com, a venture capitalist at Softbank Ventures asks:  &quot;Dave, do you really find the Internet a rebellion?  I think of it as no more or less than a new marketplace, a new media. Those who choose to rebel may find the Internet their perfect platform, just as those who choose to sell stocks, bonds, products, services may use it for those purposes as well. Was the same for radio, TV, etc., no different here.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***My response"/>
			<outline text="The people who are selling stocks and bonds on the net are rebelling against the big stodgy firms with all those retail offices that the Internet makes obsolete."/>
			<outline text="How much money have you made with your non-rebellious investments? I predict you'll only make money by selling them out, most of them will never return any shareholder value on their own. Can't pussyfoot around here and head-trips don't work."/>
			<outline text="Some of your investments are good, imho, like Christine Comaford's company, Planet U. Who are they undermining? All the consultants and production houses that think print is the right way to do coupons."/>
			<outline text="Check out the newspaper business -- they're in total leap of faith mode on this stuff. Their cart is very much upset by the Net."/>
			<outline text="The net isn't here for you to make money, or preserve the value of the investments of the media companies. It's here to be what it is."/>
			<outline text="***Conference websites"/>
			<outline text="Today is the opening day of Esther Dyson's PC Forum in Tuscon, Arizona. I can't be there this year, so I thought I'd try visiting their website to see what kind of experience I could have visiting the conference without getting on an airplane."/>
			<outline text="http://www.edventure.com/ "/>
			<outline text="At first I was excited -- it's a beautifully laid out site, with the whole conference schedule, a list of attendees, and biographies of the speakers. I was excited until I realized that it was describing last year's conference, not this year's."/>
			<outline text="Not everyone can attend every conference every year. But there are announcements and statements made that would be of interest to people who aren't attending. The people making the statements and announcements probably would like me to be able to see them, even though I'm not physically present at the conference."/>
			<outline text="I had the same experience with the Demo conference in January, where the need for a live web presence is even more justified. At Demo, there are new product announcements, stuff that's shown for the first time publicly. Would it cost much to link to press releases from each of the companies, add the links in real time, as the products are being announced? No, of course not. "/>
			<outline text="What are the promoters holding on to? Could their conferences be even more authoritative if they opened them up? Would people find less of a reason to go? I think not."/>

			<outline text="On 1/31/97 in &quot;Tricky Browser Guys&quot; I asked for a hook that would return the HTML source text of the page that's currently being displayed in the frontmost browser window. "/>
			<outline text="Two weeks ago, one of the browser companies gave me what I was asking for. We produced a new version of Frontier, did a little refining, and late last week we finalized the new stuff. "/>
			<outline text="Last night the new browser was released, and the last gasp of our creaky distribution system started up. One more upgrade, then nirvana! At least we hope..."/>
			<outline text="Here's a slice of progress! An amazing thing to me, a loop we won't have to go around again. I realize that this is much more technical an area than many people will be comfortable with. But the software is real, it's not theory. I want to make sure our industry's technical leaders have a chance to understand and learn from what we're doing."/>
			<outline text="***A klunky system"/>
			<outline text="Software distribution via the Internet is a hot topic, for a good reason. The process totally needs an overhaul! "/>
			<outline text="Here's how you download a new bit of software today. Click on the download link. Where did the file go? (Usually on my desktop!). OK. Launch WinZip or Stuffit Expander. More desktop files created. Delete the extranous ones. "/>
			<outline text="Run the installer app or script. After the software is installed, go back to the desktop and double-click on the Read Me file. What to do with the folder it leaves around? "/>
			<outline text="It's a klunky, poorly thought-out system that could be greatly improved.  "/>
			<outline text="***Fat Web Pages"/>
			<outline text="Here's how nirvana would work..."/>
			<outline text="I'm reading a web page describing a new utility. Sounds interesting! Let's check it out. "/>
			<outline text="Choose the Get Page Data command from the menubar in the web browser. A dialog confirms that I want to install the new stuff. It tells me where it's going to be stored, offering me a chance to change the place, or punt. "/>
			<outline text="An outline log window opens, recording the URL of the web page where the software came from, and the date and time. "/>
			<outline text="A window opens showing me the newly installed stuff. No software runs. If I don't like what I see, I delete the object and move on. There are no extra files on the local system. No confusing trips to the desktop. The docs contain the objects they describe. User judgement is invoked at every step of the process, nothing is done behind your back."/>
			<outline text="How does it happen? The page invisibly contains the software to be installed. These pages are called Fat Web Pages. Another app asks the web browser for the page, decodes it, and the installation process starts. The process is started thru a menu command, building on menu sharing, a standard supported by Netscape and Microsoft's Mac web browsers. "/>
			<outline text="The same idea can be used for pieces of FileMaker databases, or Eudora mailboxes, or pieces of Java applets. It's simplified software distribution via the net, with security, and it's for everyone, not just Frontier people."/>
			<outline text="***Bullet points"/>
			<outline text="People will want to know if this is secure. It's more secure than the current system we're using. The purpose is to simplify object distribution, and it does that too. "/>
			<outline text="The Internet, at its point of connection to the local system, only knows about files, it doesn't understand objects. Think of objects that live in shared environments, sometimes called sandboxes, not apps that live in structures of files and directories. We're solving a routing problem and removing steps from an unnecessarily complex process. "/>
			<outline text="There's the opportunity to make things easy if the sandbox software knows how to get stuff out of and into local storage systems at both ends of the pipe. But it shouldn't depend on server software being installed. We like static pages because they are platform-agnostic and can be served cheaply."/>
			<outline text="The objects being distributed should never appear in the user's file system -- they should go directly into the database. "/>
			<outline text="***Moving cross-platform"/>
			<outline text="We're porting our environment to Win32, so cross-platform formats is a big issue in our shop these days. To span two platforms, we need a new distribution format. We decided that HTML with embedded comments is the way to go. That's what a fat page looks like when you View Source on one."/>
			<outline text="As with all complex technology problems, we want to iterate to the solution. Today's release is our first step. And we want to be open so our format can be used to distribute new software parts for other environments such as Java and ActiveX. "/>
			<outline text="Our website tools are already compatible, and it's possible for other tools to be compatible. It will also work on Windows, if and when a browser vendor implements the hook."/>
			<outline text="***Thanks Microsoft!"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.1b1 for the Mac, released last night, implements the get-source hook we need to make fat web pages possible."/>
			<outline text="We're releasing Frontier 4.2.2 today to coincide with their release. It fully implements the scenario described earlier in this piece. More info is at: "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/fatPages/ "/>
			<outline text="We're going to use fat pages to distribute new software for the Frontier community. It will still be possible to get updates using Netscape Navigator, but it will be easier with browsers that support the get-source hook, for now, Internet Explorer. I hope Netscape implements the hook, and that Microsoft implements it in their Windows browser."/>
			<outline text="Finally, thanks to Microsoft, especially Chris Evans, Alex Hopmann and Don Bradford, for taking a chance on us. What an uncommon experience to work with a large company from my small company base. I hope it predicts a lot of cooperation and collaboration in the future."/>

			<outline text="San Jose has been near the center of the high tech industry for several generations, but the Mercury has just been a stepping-stone for reporters who eventually seek national prominence thru pubs like the Wall Street Journal and Business Week. "/>

			<outline text="***A young valley"/>
			<outline text="Compared to Washington or New York, San Jose is a very young place. Power is crudely managed here. Larry Ellison is a great example. "/>
			<outline text="He broadcasts his business aspirations casually in a recorded interview with a Mercury reporter. He broadcasts his sexual needs on national TV. He emerges looking like a lout, a bully, a child, and maybe this is true to who he is."/>

			<outline text="I listen to Gil Amelio speak yesterday in the Merc, and I don't believe him. I want the reporter to dig in, to challenge with meaningful questions. To discover whether he really knows what he's doing. To test his intellect the way Washington journalists test Greenspan."/>

			<outline text="Lots of stuff going on, not much time to write today, but I wanted to point people at the next revision of the Fat Pages format."/>
			<outline text="Learning a lot here. Because a bit of software is now a web page, a collection of software becomes a website, or a tour thru several sites. "/>
			<outline text="A page can contain an outline or a table of data, not just bits of program code. "/>
			<outline text="And thru menu sharing, we can embed menus that show up in the web browser's menu bar. So the format can handle platform-specific data types. That's an important requirement."/>
			<outline text="The web browser provides a familliar and friendly interface. Unlike other new software distribution mechanisms, this one builds on what's already been accomplished in web authoring, both in the power of the tools and in the depth of knowledge in the authoring world. "/>
			<outline text="And... we have a logo! Thanks to Maurice Rickard for doing the design, and thanks to everyone else for contributing their creativity and hard work.  Pointers on the Fat Pages site."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/fatPages/ "/>
			<outline text="***More work to do"/>
			<outline text="We still have to work on data encoding formats. Base64? Binhex? Or a C string constant? I like the last approach the best, it's simple and relatively readable for human beings."/>
			<outline text="A pointer mechanism, allowing indirection, is a good idea that's been suggested. It's important to look at scaling the format for large stuff, embedded objects that are larger than most GIFs you see around the web. "/>
			<outline text="We have to allow for multiple processors on each machine. The format should allow the content to say which is the preferred app for handling the data. We'll implement a router that works on the Mac platform."/>
			<outline text="We're still not at the RFC stage. I want to move quickly, and am willing to iron out differences with others later. And in the meantime I'm being responsive to people's suggestions. It's time to move quickly, I think, so that's what I'm doing. "/>
			<outline text="***An important endorsement"/>
			<outline text="Endorsements mean a lot. Here's what John Gillmore, gnu@toad.com, said:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Thanks for trying to take on the 'easy installation' problem.  The out of box experience is very important -- and usually quite painful.  "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Many times it's the OS that forces this (you have to stick things in particular places, reboot, have special permission, etc), but it is also frequently just poor design of the application's installer. Even the standard MacOS Installer makes you switch floppies more times than necessary, for no reason I could ever discern. You even have to stick in the first floppy at the end, again!"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Whatever you can do to improve this will be a big deal.  Make sure your first attempt is very extensible though; you will discover numerous things to fix as the first hundred companies use it, and even more things you'll kick yourself over as the first thousand do.  Try to get some real complicated apps early -- I don't use a Mac enough to point an obvious one out, but maybe something like AutoCAD.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="***Old movies"/>
			<outline text="The film industry is setting up a system so that prints of movies will be viewable a hundred years from now. There have been disasters, classic movies that have been lost or badly damaged. They're getting systematic about doing backups so their work has historic value and as an investment in the future."/>
			<outline text="***Software is different"/>
			<outline text="Software is different from film. Even slight damage to a piece of software can render it unusable, where a film can sustain a lot of damage and still be viewable."/>
			<outline text="In film there are just a few formats, a few different kinds of players. Software is more complex. My story is an example, in the late 70s I did development on a Cromemco Z2D, with 8-inch floppies, running the UCSD P-System on top of CP/M. The machine is long gone, but I still have the floppies containing the code I was working on. Does anyone else have a machine enough like this one to read its floppies? I doubt it."/>
			<outline text="Then I switched to an Apple II running the P-System, then to an IBM PC running Microsoft Pascal on MS-DOS. Then a big discontinuity, a new source code base on a Macintosh using Think C (originally called Lightspeed C). Now we use Metrowerks and Microsoft's development environments on Macs and Win32."/>
			<outline text="The point -- I don't have a trail of working computers behind me that can read all those disks. I have no idea if any of it is readable or usable. Even though I have the disks -- there's no way of being sure that the formats of the disks are readable by any computer I could put my hands on. "/>
			<outline text="***Perspective"/>
			<outline text="We leave things behind. Our industry is always in panic mode. We never have time to save our work, to be sure that we leave a sure trail behind us. There's no backup. Things get lost."/>
			<outline text="And there have been disasters, in major companies, that haven't been reported in the press. Has Apple ever explained to its investors how it protects its software assets? Has Microsoft? Netscape? Has the company you work for or own stock in?"/>

			<outline text="***Sun versus Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="It's an old-style computer industry face-off. The surprise is that there still are old-style face-offs. I thought Microsoft won? Didn't they? Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="I wonder what the software industry would look like if the Internet hadn't come along. Who would Bill Gates face off against? Where would he go for a source of heat? Today, it's clear, pun intended, that his heat is coming from Sun."/>
			<outline text="***It's just a language"/>
			<outline text="Sun's Java is just a language, like Pascal or C or C++, designed for very geekish developers, the kinds of people who build commercial applications, and mission critical corporate applications. "/>
			<outline text="Java is just a language until you add a toolbox. It comes with a small set of standard toolbox libraries called The AWT. But it's not a deep toolbox when compared to earlier development platforms. "/>
			<outline text="***The Macintosh Toolbox"/>
			<outline text="The Mac Toolbox was one of the major innovations of the platform, when it was first released thirteen years ago. The Mac wasn't a Pascal machine (that was its native language) it was a Toolbox machine. When you learned to program a Mac, you got a phone directory size book, called Inside Macintosh, that explained, chapter by chapter, how all the toolboxes worked."/>
			<outline text="The Mac is a conglomeration of collaborating interconnected toolboxes. The Menu Manager, the Dialog Manager, the Window Manager -- there's one manager for each of the basic features of the operating system. Learning the Mac is equivalent to learning the toolboxes. Developing for the Mac was a study in understanding how the toolboxes connected with each other."/>
			<outline text="The language was relatively unimportant, as it turns out. Even though the Mac started as a Pascal machine, most new software for the Mac is written in C or C++. This switch was painful for some, but it happened anyway, because developers preferred C to Pascal."/>
			<outline text="The Toolbox is a Good Thing, even though some developers, including me, resisted it when it first came out. &quot;I design user interfaces, that's what I do,&quot; I said at the time. Eventually I gave it up and went with the flow and used the same window code and menu code that everyone else did. "/>
			<outline text="There were tremendous advantages in sharing a toolbox. You could hire programmers from other teams and they could start working on  your code right away. And the users liked it -- with standard user interfaces, they could use more software. And marketing people liked it too, because we could sell more software. It was a win-win-win. We just had to let go of some old ideas to let it happen."/>
			<outline text="The disadvantage of the common toolbox theme was that it gave too much power to Apple, and they abused the trust often, holding back progress, making developers wait, and paralyzing the market at times when many of us wanted to move forward. "/>
			<outline text="No idea is perfect, even shared toolboxes, and I hope that Sun and others can learn from the lessons of the Mac platform, and not make the same mistakes, or allow Microsoft to make those mistakes by not offering a challenge to them."/>
			<outline text="***There's the difference"/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates apparently looked at Java and asked the same question a lot of us asked. Where's the toolbox? And he did more than ask the question, later today he offers an answer."/>
			<outline text="Sun's answer appears to be &quot;It's a developer opportunity.&quot; Wrong! We want standardization on the basic no-brainer stuff. We don't want competing ways to do scrollbars. "/>
			<outline text="If given a choice, I'm sure developers will go with a phone directory of standard calls that everyone uses. I'm sure most of us don't want Microsoft calling the shots, but in a vacuum, without a credible offering from Sun, what choice is there?"/>
			<outline text="***An interesting day"/>
			<outline text="I'm going to listen today. At 8:30AM we'll hear from James Gosling and Alan Baratz of JavaSoft. In the afternoon, at 3PM, a panel of luminaries will discuss the future of Java. And then at 7PM, we'll hear from Bill Gates. "/>

			<outline text="I don't like Sun. Every time I sit in an audience listening to a Sun pitch, I get angry. I'm going to try to figure out why that is. It's the same feeling I got sitting in an old-style Apple audience. There's something that these people aren't saying. They're lying to cover it up. "/>
			<outline text="I don't think Microsoft is the big destroyer Sun says they are. I think they clean up the messes companies like Sun and Apple and Novell (IBM and Netscape too) leave behind, and get paid well for doing it."/>
			<outline text="***The shame of Java"/>
			<outline text="Java grabbed the cursor and assumed a lot of the future of the Internet. The promise of the Internet was open-ness. No one owns the standards. I've written about this many times. It was a way around the mess created by the failures of earlier Microsoft challengers who couldn't overcome their own greed and stupidity and ineptness. "/>
			<outline text="The shame of Java is that it's being used to serve Sun's corporate purposes. To keep their stock price up, to employ more and more people. They're willing to share power, but only with other huge deal-making corporations. They think this strategy will fend off failure. They're wrong!"/>
			<outline text="It made sense for Sun to own Java for some time, but that time is gone. It's time for Sun to set it free. To become an important, even leading, Java developer. Let the language find its own way in the world without their corporate fear."/>
			<outline text="***You can't own English"/>
			<outline text="Sun CEO Scott McNealy seems to agree. &quot;You don't have to own English to be a writer.&quot; Right on! But his employees aren't listening to him. I suspect that McNealy isn't technical enough, or doesn't care enough, to understand what they're doing. Eventually Sun will certainly set Java free. But will they do it before or after they destroy the entrepreneurial energy of the Internet? "/>
			<outline text="I don't own Java, that's clear. But I also write software. Some of it would fit into Sun's model for appropriate software for a guy like me to develop, and some would not because I don't work for IBM or Netscape, or another of their corporate partners. "/>
			<outline text="I would like to feel that I own Java as much as anyone does. To have a competitive market, where I don't have to prove anything to anyone else in order to have a right to contribute. But that's not the system they've put in place. It's all designed to put them at the top of a pyramid. They're inventing stuff that's already been invented. And not doing a great job of it. They struggle to hold on. I don't believe it can work."/>
			<outline text="***Fear"/>
			<outline text="They ask if I fear Microsoft. That's not the point. Clearly they fear Microsoft. But I fear them much more. When my fear is the primary thing, I stay way. I hope!"/>
			<outline text="No doubt there will be more to say about this."/>

			<outline text="It's funny how the package doesn't always predict the intellect. To look at Yogi, you'd think he's kind of a slow guy. But he's deep. He came came up with It ain't over till it's over and You can observe a lot just by watching."/>
			<outline text="Right on Yogi!"/>
			<outline text="***Sports reporters"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I ranted about Sun, but the real problem is the technology press. If only they were as challenging and astute and deep as the baseball press. Understand that it's a game, there are rules, strategies that work and strategies that don't. "/>
			<outline text="A good baseball manager saves some pitchers for the next day. If I were a sports reporter, covering a baseball team, and if yesterday they used all their starting pitchers as relievers, I'd predict a losing outcome for today's game."/>
			<outline text="The technology press must be very confused about Java. All the pubs were represented at the Sun press conference on Wednesday, but where were the reports? Why was there no coverage of Sun's Java announcements in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or the San Jose Mercury on Thursday morning? "/>
			<outline text="The Java licensing scheme, and its connection to their proposal to ISO, is an important story. Dig a little deeper guys and gals. "/>
			<outline text="***Java is about money"/>
			<outline text="They aren't telling all about Java. There are secrets. What are the terms of the license agreements that Sun has struck with Netscape, Apple, Oracle, IBM, etc? It's confidential. "/>
			<outline text="Even so, we can figure out what's happening. When the facts aren't in evidence, there's always the tea leaves and human nature, and the attitude of Silicon Valley, and unhappy employees, to fill in the blanks. "/>
			<outline text="Let's say I want to do a license for Java. Get out the checkbook and start writing. Add another zero. Add another. Next year, more millions. Add it up. JavaSoft has 400 employees. That's a big burn rate. "/>
			<outline text="OK -- what do I get for those millions? The right to use the Java brand name, for sure. Java is not the name of a language, but a trademark owned by Sun Microsystems. I pay Sun money for the right to say that this is Java.  "/>
			<outline text="There's a feedback system, according to Sun. First they listen to licensees, then they listen to the general world. Pay us money, and we'll implement your ideas. I suspect that the more money you pay, the more they listen."/>
			<outline text="***Gosling is the key guy"/>
			<outline text="James Gosling is the original Java guy. I heard him speak several times on Wednesday. As a language developer myself, I see lots to admire in him, but I also see his struggle."/>
			<outline text="If anyone is, Gosling is the soul of Java. He's still at Sun. If Java is a cash cow, he's the one who sold it. I don't begrudge him the money, he deserves to be a rich man. But how empowered is he at JavaSoft? How well do Alan Baratz and Scott McNealy listen to him? If he said &quot;Java must be set free now&quot; would they do it?"/>
			<outline text="I watch body language. I watch Bill Joy look at Gosling for approval, while he explains how he was involved in the development of Java. I listen to Arthur Van Hoff of Marimba, another original member of the Java team. I've talked with Arthur one-on-one several times. I see a different Arthur on stage, a strong, enthusiastic, opinionated developer. I believe I see the connection between Gosling and Van Hoff, it's student and teacher -- there's respect there, both ways. "/>
			<outline text="***Java was an accident"/>
			<outline text="Gosling and his project were minor corporate footballs inside Sun. Not nurtured, forgotten in a quiet cul de sac while Sun fought other battles, while Bill Joy was the technical spokesperson for Sun. Even though legally, Sun owned Java, they had, on a personal and professionl level, disowned Gosling and his team. "/>
			<outline text="Off on the side, working month after month, Gosling was in solitary achievement mode. That's why Java is a good language! That's how all excellent software happens."/>
			<outline text="Then, thru an accident of history, and a marketing manager who was paying attention to the outside world, an opening was created, and Java and was thrust into the opening. There was follow-thru. A small part of Sun came awake, decided to win, all the planets were lined up, and winning happened."/>
			<outline text="Java was a reaction to the wizards of Wizzy. A vote for the geeks. A necessary balance to the world of easy-to-use software."/>
			<outline text="Java was also love at first sight. Like the happy computer that greets Mac users, Java loves the world, and the world loves Java!"/>
			<outline text="But that was just the beginning..."/>
			<outline text="***It's Apple all over again"/>
			<outline text="Like Java, Macintosh was an accident of history. Apple was dead in 1983 when the Mac came together. The IBM PC was a juggernaut, the Apple II was was a true cash cow, dying as a platform, and Lisa was a failed corporate head trip. "/>
			<outline text="Macintosh filled a void. A friendly computer. And it had a long life ahead of it because it wasn't limited to 640K. And it was designed, not thrown together. Many of those advantages are still evident in the Mac platform. Multiple monitors, easy plug and play, interapplication communication."/>
			<outline text="By 1987, as the corporate credit-takers took over, the seeds of the downfall of the Mac fell into place. By 1990, it was evident how the Mac would end. When Windows 3.0 came out, and Apple failed to respond, it was clear that Mac was being viewed as a cash cow, not being managed or nurtured, but being allowed to serve egos, not a community, tethered to a corporate earnings statement and big engineering egos, when so much more was possible."/>
			<outline text="Java is in the corporate ownership phase of its life. Being set up to be assumed by Microsoft. This loop is closing right now. And, as I said yesterday, it's a shame. It's still possible for it to be much more than that, but there isn't much time left."/>
			<outline text="***A sidebar"/>
			<outline text="It's interesting to note that Larry Ellison has a different idea for Apple than Steve Jobs. A new set of public quotes from Ellison say that Rhapsody is a loser, that Apple's only valuable asset is the current Macintosh OS, and that all of Apple's remaining energy should be focused on that. The quotes have appeared in print, and are being confirmed by reporters who have interviewed him."/>
			<outline text="If this is his true intention, I support it. Rhapsody is a total Hail Mary play. Apple has never supported System 7. It's their only product. Focusing on that is the only way for Apple to remain a viable platform vendor."/>
			<outline text="***Why Java wants to be free"/>
			<outline text="Back to Java."/>
			<outline text="Simply put, Java needs a great 1997 graphic interface. Do we trust the engineers from Netscape, IBM and Sun to do it? "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has a deep base of know-how in easy to use graphic interfaces. Forget corporate reputations. This is 1997, the people who did the Mac have left Apple. Some of them work for Microsoft now. (For example, Steve Capps, one of the original Mac team members, now works for Microsoft.)"/>
			<outline text="The next few months are critical. Sun has put its exclusive bet on the &quot;Swing Set&quot; team from Netscape and IBM. But what if they don't produce something as pretty as Microsoft? And is that good enough? No, we need better choices. This is 1997. Director happened. The web happened. I saw the demos on Wednesday. Microsoft's interface is much more attractive than the Sun-developed one."/>
			<outline text="Instead of having two choices, we now need fifty choices. Then let the market shake out. With any luck, given the huge opportunity, a more than adequate interface will emerge, a true alternative to Microsoft's."/>
			<outline text="The Sun-led strategy is a total Hail Mary play. Bet the whole outcome on one group of engineers. It isn't the quiet period anymore for Java. This ain't a rehearsal, it's the real thing."/>
			<outline text="I want a shot at this juicy opportunity. Hey, so does Arthur! Look at Bongo. Why doesn't Sun look to Marimba to solve this problem? See the bigger problem? Why should all the rest of us bet so heavily on the wisdom of Sun's management team? They're so overworked. And they're in the way."/>
			<outline text="***Ownership"/>
			<outline text="When will Silicon Valley get the message that great software is created by people not companies? When will the financiers of Silicon Valley set up corporate systems that serve the products, instead of vice versa? And when will creative engineers stop selling their babies to the miserable petty agendas of small thinking corporate credit-takers?"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Bill Gates on Java&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/5/97; 9:26:42 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here's some of what Bill Gates, billg@microsoft.com, is thinking about on a Saturday morning."/>
			<outline text="&quot;When Microsoft wanted to do Java, Sun told us we had to help fund JavaSoft in a big way and do a lot of other things, so we did what they asked. When Sun wanted to clone Windows they didn't call us or pay us or anything. Which is open Java or Windows?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Why are they trying to create a religion with purity concepts? Is native code compilation so bad? Is being able to call a platform a bad thing? Most languages can call the database libraries, multimedia libraries, graphics and text libraries that have already been created. They are insisting everything be rebuilt."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Imagine a pure application running on the Macintosh - no clipboard calls. No desktop integration. No scripting support. People rejected every application on the Mac that didn't exploit the platform. Now this is being demanded as part of the Java religion. Is this driven by what users want or what an industry insider wants?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Microsoft embraces Java as one of the languages that people will develop in - in fact we brought good debugging to Java and we have the best performance VM. Our AFC libraries give people graphics and UI richness. So we are one of the companies involved in Java but we think C, Visual Basic and other languages will still be of great importance. We have an advance in our object model we will show next month that allows all languages to work together with some big benefits."/>
			<outline text="&quot;As long as we are talking about Java, another important thing to disclose to people is that 16-bit machines (the 60 million computers running Windows 3.1) will never have usable Java performance. Netscape never went final with their 16-bit VM. Sun didn't even do one. Netscape claims they will do one with Communicator but Communicator won't fit on 90% of 16-bit PCs. Our Caffeine marks were tripled recently from 13 to 41 but it's too slow to be usable. We are over 1000 on Win32."/>
			<outline text="&quot;All languages are independent of hardware assuming you have the right code generator. Most applications require operating system services whether it's a duplicate operating system on top of the main one or the primary OS on the machine."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Of 6 emails I sent early on a Saturday morning I have already had responses to 4 of them. You, Esther Dyson and 2 Microsoft people. It's kind of crazy how much people are available on email but it's very nice.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="A couple of housekeeping messages."/>
			<outline text="First, I didn't explain what the football term &quot;Hail Mary!&quot; means. "/>
			<outline text="It's the most dramatic play in American football. There's no time left. You're the quarterback, the guy with the ball. You're going to lose if you don't score. Send the receivers deep. Good coverage from the other guys. Take a few steps back. Wait. The crowd leaps to its feet. Hail Mary! OK here goes. Throw it hard and far. Fall to your knees. Throw your hands into the air. Ave Maria. Pray! "/>
			<outline text="Second, a lot of people don't know about my home page. "/>
			<outline text="As I browse the web, gathering background for my DaveNet pieces and web development, I link them into the list on that page. So if you like what's going on in DaveNet, or find it interesting, you'll find more interesting stuff on the website. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/ "/>
			<outline text="Most of the new pieces go up in the morning, Pacific time, sometimes starting very early. We're about to go multi-user, I'm working with a friend on this expansion, so there will be even more interesting stuff in the coming weeks and months on the scripting page. "/>
			<outline text="***Are highways safe?"/>
			<outline text="OK, back to the story."/>
			<outline text="I made a couple of roundtrips to San Francisco this week. Sometimes I drive to San Jose. Every time I do it, I enter an unsecure system."/>
			<outline text="What are we doing about drunk drivers? Tires that blow out? Ice? Earthquakes? There's lots to worry about!"/>
			<outline text="I think computer networks should be as safe as they can possibly be. I think the roads should be too."/>
			<outline text="***The press"/>
			<outline text="The press only knows three stories, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil, and Java is the future."/>
			<outline text="And they only ask two questions -- Is Apple still dead? Is Microsoft still evil? "/>
			<outline text="Let's ask the third question. "/>
			<outline text="***Cash cows and sacred cows"/>
			<outline text="If you're a Java developer or licensee you're the stuff between two slices of bread. The slices are Sun's virtual machine and Microsoft's. The economic battle, as Sun has defined it, is huge, the stakes are too high for Microsoft to ignore. "/>
			<outline text="Another metaphor. Microsoft is a brick wall. Like so many in the past, Sun has decided to throw itself against the wall as hard as it can, hoping to break it."/>
			<outline text="Here's what the wall looks like. Microsoft has OEM deals with virtually every PC hardware manufacturer. They make money on each PC they sell. This is a multi-billion dollar business for Microsoft. It would be very natural for PC-makers to license their Java VM from Microsoft instead of Sun. Where are Dell and Gateway and Compaq on this?"/>
			<outline text="And Sun's mainstay operating system, Solaris, is being undermined by Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. There's a lot of movement to NT. Sun must fear that NT will displace Solaris. "/>
			<outline text="***Two questions"/>
			<outline text="First question -- Microsoft has a Java Virtual Machine to offer OEMs. Does their contract with Sun prohibit them from licensing that VM? "/>
			<outline text="Second question -- has any magazine done a comparative review of Microsoft's Java VM against Sun's? Which is better? "/>
			<outline text="I understand that Sun's is 100 percent pure. Now, which runs faster and runs more usable apps?"/>
			<outline text="***The future"/>
			<outline text="This Java stuff is an interesting distraction, but the future is still the web. "/>
			<outline text="It's the platform without the platform vendor. It's mine as much as Sun's. No one can get in my way here. There are millions of web users and it's growing at an incredible pace. "/>
			<outline text="All the dissent over Java runtimes is killing Java. Sure it's built into the web browsers, but even the leading Java developers say that the interesting stuff will run outside the browser. As soon as you go that route, Java loses its advantage."/>
			<outline text="I write code in Java-like languages. You can build new things with Java, for sure, but you can do that with other languages and in more complete environments. "/>
			<outline text="In other words, if you have an idea there's no need to wait for Java to catch up with you."/>

			<outline text="How safe is the net? If you put the blinders on, it can be made safe. If you're a realist, you realize that the net is wide open. To close the holes, you'd have to take FTP links out of web browsers. Until that happens, trust is what we depend on. "/>
			<outline text="The security debate is a good thing because it makes people aware of what can go wrong. Defensive surfing! Always check the mirrors, and look over your shoulder. Get a good idea of what you're installing before you install it. The human element is hard to defeat, especially if the human is paying attention."/>
			<outline text="***Sandboxes"/>
			<outline text="Another positive thing about the security issue is that it gets us thinking about sandboxes. A sandbox is a safe place to build a castle. If it gets knocked down, no big deal. Sandboxes -- what a great name! It says that we use our computers for fun. I like that."/>
			<outline text="A sandbox is any computer structure you're willing to build and then lose. Cookies are a kind of a sandbox. And cookies are just like the Preferences folder on a Macintosh. You can always drag it to the trash and start over."/>
			<outline text="***Scripted firewalls"/>
			<outline text="We'll build a firewall between a sandbox and your personal, safe world. A way to run scripts against the sandbox that synchronize between it and your private more protected world. In this one place, only a user request to synchronize, a request that can't be imitated by software, is required to start the process."/>
			<outline text="***Sandboxes, refined"/>
			<outline text="I want to make sandboxes richer. "/>
			<outline text="I think that's where web browsers and servers and content software are headed. Since the technologists at the leading client and server companies don't do site management and workflow software, they probably don't understand how important this will be on the content development side of the pipe."/>
			<outline text="A picture, on one side of the connection, wants to assemble itself on the other side. That's what the web is about, that's what email is about. In a fundamental sense, that's all the net is about. Collecting stuff, and then using it. "/>
			<outline text="Everyone's collection is unique. Everyone generates content, even if you don't think you do. Do you write email? Do you receive email? "/>
			<outline text="Think of an emailer as a communication-aware content development tool. Boy, there are a lot of interesting places to go with that idea."/>
			<outline text="***Fat Web Pages, Week 3"/>
			<outline text="I've connected my sandbox to the web. A piece of my sandbox can be embedded in a web page. If you want to add it to your sandbox, choose a menu command, click OK to a confirmation dialog, and it's done, cleanly, with no crap left around on your desktop. "/>
			<outline text="Informed participation with confirmation. That's how sandbox software will work. Fat Web Pages is a step in this direction."/>
			<outline text="The first versions of Fat Pages were spec-less, a spec is there now. Object types are now MIME types. We use Base 64 encoding to pack the objects. "/>
			<outline text="The spec is wide open, I think, it should be possible for any database vendor to use it to distribute new parts. But it's for database users too, not just vendors -- but the users must look to the vendors for guidance on how to do it."/>
			<outline text="We made sure that the fat pages spec includes enough information so crawler scripts can visit a set of sites and get updated versions of already-installed software in a safe way. "/>
			<outline text="I believe the idea will find its way into the right places just by putting a pointer in this DaveNet piece. So if you know a developer who likes the web and has database software that you use, please point them to this page:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/fatPages/stories/apr8changes.html "/>
			<outline text="Feedback is welcome. It's been an essential part of the process. The spec has evolved and will continue to evolve if people report deal-stoppers. We want this to work for all possible data types that could be transported via the web. Thoughtful, calmly-expressed concerns are appreciated. "/>
			<outline text="***Growing beyond DaveNet"/>
			<outline text="More and more, DaveNet is just a part of what we're doing editorially. We've now got a dozen regular contributors and I believe we're covering some markets better than anyone else. "/>
			<outline text="The umbrella for all our editorial stuff is called Scripting News. It started as a news site for people who do scripting. We learn about what scripting people are interested in. And we help define the idea of scripting, by including issues of web design, the tools we use, standards and proposed standards, politics and free speech issues. Crossing platform boundaries is essential. Lots of things are interesting to scripting people. We try to cover it all."/>
			<outline text="The tagline for the home page is &quot;News and commentary from the cross platform scripting community.&quot; DaveNet definitely fits under that umbrella. Lots of other voices too. I encourage people to use this resource and help us develop it."/>

			<outline text="A major transition is happening among Mac users. "/>
			<outline text="The ones who have remained are the ones with the highest cost of switching platforms. That's why they waited so long. If you're switching now, you don't want to do it again anytime soon. "/>
			<outline text="So the final mass exodus from the Mac is going to Windows, not Solaris and not Java OS. By the time they get their scrollbars working in Java, the transition will be complete. Their timing is off by at least a couple of years to catch this flow. "/>
			<outline text="It would have made sense for the Sun people to have made friends with the Mac users and developers, not Apple! I've offered, publicly, so many times, to work with the Unix people and that includes the people at Sun. "/>
			<outline text="I think it's ironic, being a Mac developer, that I'm going to meet up with my potential Unix brothers and sisters on Bill Gates's operating system. "/>
			<outline text="***Box thinking"/>
			<outline text="Sun says get your mind out of the box. A cute, but arrogant phrase, implying that they understand what the box is, and that there's something interesting outside of it. "/>
			<outline text="Sun's argument is remininscent of the early promoters of PDAs, General Magic, Go,  and Apple, only more vague. Don't miss that the Pilot PDA, which is quickly becoming a platform, is winning because of its smooth connection to desktop systems. "/>
			<outline text="The primary point of connection to the net is the PC. Microsoft will continue to own the box that Sun wants us to get out of. The truth, the box is very important, even if you don't have a cute marketing slogan to go with it."/>
			<outline text="***A two-horse race"/>
			<outline text="Sun is trying to reduce the software world to a two-horse race but Microsoft is listening better than Sun. They ask the question I wonder about. Is it necessary for us to rewrite all our software? The customers don't ask us to do this, only the people who work at Java-invested companies do. "/>
			<outline text="Another disconnect -- Sun focuses all the attention on Microsoft, and ignores the other languages and development environments that are already delivering what Java promises. They want to wipe the slate clean, not just of Microsoft, but all other software too. "/>
			<outline text="That sounds fine to some, until you realize how far they have to go before they can build all that they need to build to get their platform competitive with Windows. "/>
			<outline text="***Can you work with Microsoft?"/>
			<outline text="Conventional wisdom in the software industry says no, you can't work with Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="And advice comes from inside Microsoft -- unless they buy you, don't work with them. This isn't coming from outside, it's coming from inside. "/>
			<outline text="I understand that like all big companies, Microsoft is a ouija board. There's a disconnect in there. I can't get inside Bill Gates and figure out what wants. Even if I could, it's too big a company to understand what's going on, too many people, too many different ideas."/>
			<outline text="So, is it safe to work with Microsoft? They do usurp ideas and markets from other developers. I'm not going to argue good or bad, right or wrong, but if I make an investment, I want to be around to collect the rewards if I'm proven right. If all the upside belongs to Microsoft, why bother investing?"/>
			<outline text="The &quot;Microsoft is evil&quot; rap works well for Microsoft. It keeps the journalists singing the right tune. Keeps money and users flowing to Microsoft and away from smaller teams of developers at smaller companies."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft may tell you otherwise, and may honestly intend for it to be otherwise, but this is the reality. The wonderful thing about the Internet is that it was free of this kind of control until recently. "/>
			<outline text="Sometimes I think Sun and Microsoft are in collusion, by distracting us to focus the attention on their faceoff, we lose sight of what we're really giving up -- true diversity and choice."/>
			<outline text="I imagine that Gates has never been fudded like he's being fudded now. Now maybe he can imagine what it's like being a creative developer with passion for an idea, being headed off by big-company FUD and journalists that go along with it. I've stayed away from Microsoft battles, but now I'm getting in there. And I now can see the wall of FUD, in the minds of journalists and other developers, if not in the minds of Microsoft people."/>
			<outline text="Gates says he's for choice, but I doubt if they've left space on their map of the PC industry for my software. I'll have to make my own space, and hope that they haven't scoped out my territory, or somehow it's too small a niche to interest them, or that my implementation is so good that enough people choose my stuff over theirs."/>
			<outline text="This is Sun's doing. Microsoft could never have regained so much power on their own. Only in contrast to Sun's incredible greed is the Microsoft pitch even worth listening to. Sun offers me no way to win with them. Microsoft at least offers choice, but we believe that they mean choice of languages, not choice of vendors. Sun doesn't even offer a choice of languages! They insist on wiping the slate clean, and that means wiping out my investment. It would be totally nuts for me to follow them."/>
			<outline text="***Staying optimistic"/>
			<outline text="Can Microsoft change? Yes, I'm optimistic. I think they're growing so fast that they can afford to build some truly competitive relationships with other developers. "/>
			<outline text="I think the Sun people are mostly good-hearted and mean what they say, they just miss the implications and contradictions, or don't have enough experience working with developers. "/>
			<outline text="I think that Apple shareholders really want there to be a Mac with more software written to the Mac APIs. I hope for all this, even though the facts don't lead to these conclusions."/>
			<outline text="If ever there was a time to shake your head and wonder why humans are so dysfunctional, why there is so little communication, or real friendship, if you're into software and networks, now is the right time to do it."/>

			<outline text="Well it's been a year since she ran away, yes that guitar player sure could play. She always liked to sing along, and he was always handy with a song! "/>

			<outline text="I learned something important -- that push is bigger than it seems. True, when it's reduced to its implementation, it's just another file in a website folder, or a new server that works much like a web server. "/>

			<outline text="In marriage you can't say yes to everyone, but in technology, one way to win is to get into position where you *can* say yes to everyone."/>
			<outline text="We said yes to Microsoft. It took a couple of days to adapt our content system to Microsoft's proposed standard format for channel definition. We announced this on the Scripting News page on Monday. "/>
			<outline text="People assume that we're aligning with Microsoft. We are! But don't miss this point -- we also want to align our software with Pointcast, Marimba and Netscape too."/>
			<outline text="CDF was very easy to support. A new table at the top level of a website contains the addresses of the dynamic pages on the site, with descriptions, and time information for the life and frequency of the dynamic pages. "/>
			<outline text="We built a script that runs at 2AM every night, rebuilding the CDF file for the site. We're on solid ground. Bottom line: DaveNet is a channel now!"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/fatPages/97/04/cdfSupport.html "/>
			<outline text="The structure our developers create is general. For each format a different script. Not a big deal. The reason it's easy is because we have a framework. "/>

			<outline text="***To Pointcast, Marimba and Netscape..."/>

			<outline text="I like to build on someone else's vision to scope out a problem, and then refine the implementation until they're happy it meets their needs."/>
			<outline text="I've done this kind of collaborative development in the past, developing a game with one of my best friends, Bernie DeKoven, dekovenb@mattel.com, who's now a game designer for Mattel, doing new software and hardware and websites around a very popular platform -- Barbie!"/>
			<outline text="I did the same kind of collaboration with Chris Gulker, cg@gulker.com, who was a system developer for the San Francisco Examiner in the early 90s. We worked together to automate print production for his newspaper using Frontier and Quark XPress, which was (and is) deeply compatible with our scripting environment."/>
			<outline text="Now Craig and I are talking about how the print industry moves onto the web. I believe the efforts of 1996 and early 1997 are on the right path, but more software, publishing system software, is very very important for the next steps."/>
			<outline text="***Going electronic"/>
			<outline text="The print publishing industry went partially electronic in the 80s and early 90s. Macs and desktop publishing software replaced expensive typesetting equipment. But the expensive publishing software still runs on minicomputers, and the presses are still huge machines that distribute paper and ink using trucks and airplanes."/>
			<outline text="The next step in the process completely replaces the publishing system software and the presses and trucks and airplanes. Production costs will go to virtually zero. Lead-times will go to zero too. Time becomes a much more flexible element. "/>
			<outline text="Some players won't keep up, and new players will enter. It's another publishing revolution, and it's even bigger than the one that happened the last time around."/>
			<outline text="The web works now but we wonder about the future. Electronic transport mechanisms will evolve and change. If you're in the electronic publishing business, being able to easily try out new distribution mechanisms will make a difference. "/>
			<outline text="When a new transport comes along we all want to be first on the block to flow our content out thru the new protocols. And as a software vendor I want to make that easy."/>
			<outline text="***The Seybold Online News Site"/>
			<outline text="We've been working with Craig on a new website. Rather than play with theories, we're putting up the system and hope to bring the idea online in the next few months. "/>
			<outline text="Here's the plan. It's going to be an integrated system with editors submitting pieces via email and an editor in chief who owns the front page. Stories are linked in as they become available. The site is automatically rendered using our Frontier-based Content Server software. "/>

			<outline text="Next week at the Seybold show in New York, we'll be talking about authoring tools for the web. "/>
			<outline text="Like all software developers, I want to have something new to talk about, so we've been working on Frontier 4.2.3, and yesterday it shipped. Just in time!"/>
			<outline text="There are three areas of improvement in 4.2.3. First, we added preliminary support for Microsoft's CDF &quot;push&quot; format. We also completed the implementation of Fat Web Pages, and with this release we are ready to start distributing object database &quot;parts&quot; using the new scheme."/>
			<outline text="But most of the effort in this release went into bringing our site automation features to websites managed using BBEdit and the network file system."/>
			<outline text="***BBEdit and the network file system"/>
			<outline text="BBEdit has become a standard among web developers. Remembering that the web is a big network that connects all kinds of machines, if a web developer wants to use a Macintosh, it's usually not a problem. "/>
			<outline text="FTP and HTTP and email are cross-platform standards. And many websites are just LANs, like mine, where you find Macs and NT machines that can store stuff on each others' disks through file sharing. "/>
			<outline text="That's why it's now a network file system and not the Mac file system. "/>
			<outline text="***Respect"/>
			<outline text="Even though BBEdit is a standard in the web world, it doesn't get enough respect in the press. WebDeveloper covers VRML tools on SGI machines, but I've never seen them write a review of an add-on for BBEdit, or even BBEdit itself. What a mixed-up world."/>
			<outline text="Do an experiment for me, if you're a journalist, go down the hall and ask your webmaster if he or she uses BBEdit. The chances are pretty good that they do."/>
			<outline text="I know that BBEdit is a hit. It shows up everywhere. People are proud of it! So a couple of weeks ago I cleared some time and learned what the web looks like from a BBEdit user's perspective. I did it by building a modest-size website just using BBEdit and the Mac Finder"/>
			<outline text="I wanted to see if we could do anything to increase the flexibility of these sites by adding some of the framework features we have when websites are built entirely in Frontier's object database."/>
			<outline text="***Templating"/>
			<outline text="For me, the main issue in managing a website is getting the structure out of the way, so I can write when I need to, and not worry about the look of a page. And then when it's time to upgrade the look of a site, I want to be able to change one file and rebuild the site. "/>
			<outline text="This mode-flip is essential for preserving my sanity when working on a site. Either I'm writing or I'm designing, I hardly ever do both at the same time."/>
			<outline text="So I looked at how this works for BBEdit users. When it's time to create a new page, here's what you do: open up your template file, select-all, copy it to the clipboard, open a new window and paste. "/>
			<outline text="We have a parallel to this in the software world. Doing websites this way is analogous to cribbing code instead of creating subroutines. When you copy-paste, it's hard to move forward. When you create a layer of abstraction, if you did it well, you can change the lower level without breaking the upper level stuff."/>
			<outline text="With a good framework in place, you have all the flexibility to manage sites that grow and change as your needs change, and as you get new ideas and learn."/>
			<outline text="***Magic of the Mac"/>
			<outline text="We've had this kind of stuff working in Frontier since version 4.0 shipped almost a year ago. But -- we wanted more! We didn't win the hearts and sites of most of the people who do BBEdit-based websites. We want to bring them into the family, to empower them, and earn their respect and support."/>
			<outline text="Here's where the magic of the Mac development community comes in. Rich Siegel, siegel@barebones.com, the lead developer of BBEdit is a friend of mine. We talk on the phone, I ask for a feature, he does it, we build on it, and we go forward. That's how it works. "/>
			<outline text="It's the relationship that counts! People never get that. Mac developers tend to work together. I don't know about Windows developers. We'll find out I guess. Anyway..."/>
			<outline text="Rich and I did a lot of that kind of work last year. BBEdit supports menu sharing, and that means we can add commands to their menu bar. And BBEdit also gives us hooks to find the file you're editing in the Finder, and to get the text of the frontmost window."/>
			<outline text="***Rendering pages"/>
			<outline text="This means that we can render pages for you. We can flow your stuff thru a template, we can look up glossary items in a database, and we can help flow images thru pages. "/>
			<outline text="We can move your site work up a level. Much of this is new for people who do BBEdit-based websites. And we owe Rich and his team a hearty thanks for allowing us to do it. No sarcasm! Collaborative cross-company development is a rare thing. When it works so well, it's appropriate to be grateful."/>
			<outline text="***Apple"/>
			<outline text="Finally after years of urging them to let us have the wheel, Apple is doing it. It might be the last minute, but so what? Let's have fun! We have the support of the people at Apple. That's just plain cooool."/>
			<outline text="I want people to know that developers don't have to cut each other's throats. Like the rhythm guitarist in my high school band, I don't need to hit the bass string because Rich and his buddies do it so well. And he doesn't have to do what I do, because I am happy to invest in the happiness of his users. "/>
			<outline text="And finally Apple can say yes to us too. They're focused on the health of their business, and not focused on doing our business. A patch of blue sky opens. Man if the Mac is the Titanic in its final hours, so what? If someone asks me to dance, I say yes, unless I have something better to do..."/>
			<outline text="So, right now, we're focused on web developers on the Mac. It's OK to create new software. Even Apple says so!"/>
			<outline text="***Designers, writers, geeks"/>
			<outline text="Switchin gears... there are three kinds of people that collaborate on websites, and three different kinds of tools that are essential to a smooth-flowing site. "/>
			<outline text="Designers dig products like BBEdit because it gives them control of every bit of HTML text. That's its purpose. Fusion allows them to view a page at a very high level. We view these tools as complementary, as the best ways to build templates and to manage the front page of a site. "/>
			<outline text="We make software for geeks, the people who keep the sites flowing, write the scripts and dynamic pages, do the backups, build the sites, and create systems to manage the workflow."/>
			<outline text="Writers are a whole different breed! Writers use writing tools. Duh! Hey an email program is a great web writing tool. Word processors and text editors like BBEdit are great web writing tools too. Wizzy web tools like Home Page, Page Mill, Front Page are helpful too (but they need the hooks, like BBEdit, and generally, they don't have them)."/>
			<outline text="***People working together"/>
			<outline text="There might be two or three geeks and designers on a site, but hundreds of writers. If you run a site, look at how it breaks out. If you've got thirty HTML people and ten writers, it's out of balance. Two geeks, two designers and thirty writers is totally possible if you have the right system in place."/>
			<outline text="To make a website really work well, it's important for the people to work together without getting in each others' way. Details can be hidden. If a writer has to fuss with HTML, something's wrong with the system. And the editor in chief, the person who owns the front page, needs a powerful easy to use workstation. I think that Fusion has basic stuff, with the right hooks, to be the ideal EIC workstation."/>
			<outline text="***Seybold looooms large"/>
			<outline text="Next week the focus is on web publishing. We're going to talk about automated sites with BBEdit and the file system as the user interface. I want this story to resonate because many people doing real-world websites are using BBEdit. "/>
			<outline text="My belief -- when a market like web publishing is growing and transforming so quickly, you don't have to hire a market research firm to find out what's going on. Just watch a few mailing lists and newsgroups, listen, ask questions, do what the users do, dream, then iterate, get feedback and loop back around. You get there sooner with a better answer. "/>
			<outline text="I've been doing increasingly complex websites since late 1994. I've learned that, like software, web development is a dance, not a head-trip. Short steps that you're willing to retrace with no regrets. Go with the flow, that's what I say. To go with the flow you have to be *in* the flow. So here we go..."/>
			<outline text="***The site"/>
			<outline text="Now I can say to anyone using BBEdit that our tools are relevent, the investment is appropriate, even for small sites, and the technology works. I know it works because I built a beautiful site that explains how it works. It's easy to check out, the software is still free, and I hope all serious BBEdit-based webmasters will check it out. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/21/97; 6:09:22 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I'm off to New York in a few hours for the Seybold publishing show. It's going to be fun! We're doing a DaveNet Live on Wednesday night. I'm on the closing panel on Thursday, summarizing what happened at the show and looking forward to the September show in San Francisco. And tomorrow at 4PM I'm moderating a panel entitled Can Apple Survive?"/>
			<outline text="***Apple and Seybold"/>
			<outline text="In the past, Apple has been the key hardware vendor selling to the Seybold community. It was the Macintosh that made the desktop publishing revolution possible in the mid-late 80s, when the PC platform was stuck at 640K with no plug and play, and a single monitor. "/>
			<outline text="The Can Apple Survive? question has been asked before at Seybold. It's the question everyone wants answered about Apple, always has been, going back to 1981 when IBM shipped its first PC."/>
			<outline text="***The saga continues"/>
			<outline text="Last Friday Lee Gomes reported in the Wall Street Journal that Apple has hired an investment banking firm to fight off unwelcome bids to buy a majority of its stock. "/>
			<outline text="Gomes talked with Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, and apparently Steve Jobs (he wasn't quoted in the piece) and we learned that Ellison is serious, and that Jobs is distancing himself from Ellison (good idea)."/>
			<outline text="Apple is up for grabs. It's possible that the stock play will be happening while we're discussing Apple's future tomorrow. "/>
			<outline text="So, can Apple survive? Let's talk about it..."/>
			<outline text="***The focus is still inward"/>
			<outline text="Having been an Apple-watcher for many years, I believe the cultural problem at Apple has been its insistence on solving every problem itself and relegating the developers to the fringes. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;It's a third party opportunity!&quot; was an awful joke in the halls of One Infinite Loop for many years, meaning &quot;It's too small a thing to interest creative people such as ourselves.&quot; As a developer myself I've always rebelled against such positioning."/>
			<outline text="Looking at the schedule for Apple's mid-May developer conference, I see little evidence of change. When they talk about the future of the Internet on Apple platforms they talk about WebObjects. Huh? I feel a disconnect here. They talk about Java as if it were a panacea, when most Java programmers are totally uncomfortable with the worldwide web, which is the phenomenon that's making the net happen, and is the biggest growth opportunity for the Mac platform."/>
			<outline text="***It's happening outside"/>
			<outline text="The truth is, as it always has been, that the competitive stuff is happening outside Apple. When people look at the balance sheet of Apple and conclude that the Mac has no future, they're missing this point."/>
			<outline text="Today, the powerful Mac developers are in a holding pattern. Apple took a big turn in December, already four months ago, and there's been almost no communication from Apple to developers. We keep shipping new software, as if what we are doing mattered, but given the financial news, and the lack of clear direction from Apple, we don't know if the new software is relevant! I'm sure many Mac users are equally befuddled."/>
			<outline text="I've also spoken with some of the people thinking about buying Apple and they've asked questions. I've said, over and over, the power is with the developers. But people can't seem to hear this. I wonder why? It's one of life's puzzles, I guess."/>
			<outline text="***What to do?"/>
			<outline text="So, if Larry Ellison, or someone else, wants to buy Apple, here's my advice."/>
			<outline text="First, get the top 20 developers together before WWDC for a sit-down and make some deals. Bring a checkbook and your lawyers. Listen to what they want to do. Get committments from the developers with ship dates, and guaranteed parity for the Mac platform. And commit to staying out of their markets."/>
			<outline text="Position Apple as a computer company, not a software company. Remember, it's called Apple Computer, not Apple Innovation or Apple PDAs. Narrow the product line to three recognizable form factors that you can manufacture in great quantity with great quality. Sell performance and reliability and great software from the developers you made deals with."/>
			<outline text="Complete System 8 and Rhapsody, and commit to no more than that. Bug fixes and performance improvements. Cancel WebObjects, it's too confusing, grabs too much of the spotlight from the developer community, and it represents an insignificant revenue opportunity for a company as large as Apple. This will force Apple to look outside for web solutions, a good thing for a company that's inclined to look inward."/>
			<outline text="License the Mac OS cheaply to clone makers. Look to differentiate your product with software you license from developers. The truth -- most of the value is out of the Mac OS. To charge a premium for it now defeats the purpose of having a separate platform. We all must get in line on this one and agree that we want lots of Macs from anyone, not a small number of Macs just from Apple. If that's how it plays out, the Mac loses all its remaining developer energy."/>
			<outline text="Make a deal with Metrowerks. I want the Mac APIs to build native Rhapsody apps, and Metrowerks can do that. Apple (i.e. Next) must get out of Metrowerks' way. We know Metrowerks, we have long-term relationships with them, we do deals with them all the time. We don't know the Next guys. I trust Metrowerks to stay out of our way, to keep the path forward smooth. With such a deal, Apple can afford to quiet down about Rhapsody until it's available. The market needs this quiet, very much!"/>
			<outline text="Make Apple a marketing and customer support company. That's the lesson IBM learned. It's working for IBM because they focused on understanding the market and shooting products into reality, not by creating technical visions and getting users and developers to buy into their dreams. The computer industry is really simple, as long as you don't carry the burden of trying to re-invent it. Apple has carried this burden, inelegantly, for far too long. That's why it's in so much trouble. Let the users lead. They can teach you what to sell and how to sell it."/>
			<outline text="Buy a song! Aretha has some good ones. Teach the Mac community to have fun again. Start by setting an example. I don't want Jobs or Amelio on stage, Steve's software ideas are frozen in the mid-80s, and Amelio will never understand the PC business. We need someone on stage who can leave room for developers to tell a dozen different stories about the Macintosh. A master of ceremonies, not a visionary, but a lover of diversity. The platform can be so much more than Apple can imagine. They've been in the way, and yes, even after all the layoffs and shrinking sales, they're *still* in the way."/>
			<outline text="Finally, Apple must give up competing with Microsoft. It was possible quite a few years ago, but now Microsoft is a juggernaut and Apple is lost in space, trying to find its way back home; but home doesn't exist anymore."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is employing some of the best Mac developers, and they're working on Mac software. In that is the basis for some kind of peace. Teach Mac users to respect Windows. Hey, some of their best friends use Windows now. And websites are just LANs. The old animosity isn't serving anyone, especially not Apple."/>
			<outline text="***Can Apple Survive?"/>
			<outline text="The old Apple is gone forever. The DOS command line, once the differentiator, is gone too. More change is necessary for people at Apple who are exhausted by change. It's best to do it all at once, get on a solid path forward and never look back."/>
			<outline text="Apple owns one of the most recognized trademarks in the world, with millions of users, and lots of creative developers. So, yes, Apple can survive, but from here it will require discipline and clear positioning. It's going to require more guile and subtlety for Apple to find a way forward. There aren't any easy answers left."/>
			<outline text="See you in New York!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: As usual, when I write about Apple, it's about net-effect. There are good people at Apple, people who listen and respond. But the publicly stated priorities for WWDC tell the net-effect story. Apple, like all large companies, is just a ouija board. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: Ouija is a trademark for a device consisting of a planchette and a board bearing the alphabet and various other symbols, used in spiritualistic seances, supposedly to convey and record messages from the spirits."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/25/97; 10:50:12 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I got back late last night from the Seybold show in New York. Here's a quick report, no doubt there will be more conclusions, these are just first impressions."/>
			<outline text="Seybold is a big show, mostly Mac, no Netscape booth, limited Java presence. Color is a big issue, and I wonder what that means. I take color for granted, but print publishers are in the middle of a transition, substituting expensive custom hardware and software for less expensive stuff that runs on off the shelf systems. "/>
			<outline text="To say that print is dead, as some do, is to miss the point that barriers are still coming down in the print world, new things are possible, and new economics."/>
			<outline text="It's surprising to find out how much Seybold is a Mac show. I've always stood at the fringes of Seybold, not quite sure what's going on there. But now I'm in there, and I see a lot of parallels to the other Mac-centered worlds."/>
			<outline text="Websites are a fact of life at Seybold now. Nervous jokes about not making money on the web, some coming from the leaders of the print publishing industry, indicate a deeper problem. I understand that the web upsets a lot of carts, and people are understandably scared of things that force them to change. But change is happening, catalogs and phone books and coupons, formerly exclusively print businesses, are rapidly turning electronic. News is moving onto the web. Even if money isn't being made, reputations are, and that's what media economies are built on."/>
			<outline text="The Seybold conference has the opportunity to guide this community thru its transition, but Seybold itself is going thru a transition, with the absence, for the first time, of its visionary, Jonathan Seybold. For now, it's a large show with lots of power and money. But the foundations of their world are rocking, and in that transition there may be a shift in attention."/>
			<outline text="***Push"/>
			<outline text="At the opening session and at many of the breakouts, Push Technology was much talked about, but few substantial objective opinions were offered. It's understandable that the media companies want to hear about push, but two questions come up. First, is it really Push? and is it really Technology?"/>
			<outline text="Having looked in fair detail at four leading methods of push, I believe that they have little in common, none is really push, and there isn't anything practical you can do without opening significant security holes in your network."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft and Pointcast, who aligned in March on a standard way of describing dynamic web content called Channel Definition Format, or CDF, seem to be going their own ways now. The docs for CDF are scanty, we haven't received verification from Microsoft that we're correctly supporting it, I suspect that's not possible because CDF is still being specified. "/>
			<outline text="And even if CDF were complete, I have trouble seeing the substance. I've identified three dynamic pages on the DaveNet site, described in a CDF file. Can any software read this file and do something interesting with it? "/>
			<outline text="Even less revolutionary is Netscape's plan for push, called Netcaster. After cutting thru the features, trying to find some technology, Netcaster is simply scheduled bookmarks. Perhaps some value for some users, but, as a web master and web writer, I don't get excited by this. It saves a tiny bit of work for readers, and really doesn't get my content in front of readers on a more reliable basis, which is the idea behind push. Same with CDF and Pointcast."/>
			<outline text="I've written a fair amount about Marimba's Castanet/Bongo combo. See &quot;Can't Touch This!&quot;, 2/25/97."/>
			<outline text="The bottom line, if you want simulated push, email is still the best bet. Sure it lacks the animated GIFs of web pages, but it's a great transport for ideas. And if you want real push, not simulated, your users need a fulltime net connection, and a powerful safe sandbox, something much richer than the caches that the current web browser vendors are providing, and more easily controlled than what Marimba is proposing."/>
			<outline text="For now, and for the forseeable future, web browsers are the way to go. Get readers to come back by putting interesting stuff on your home page as often as you can."/>
			<outline text="***An idea for Symantec"/>
			<outline text="I floated a trial balloon at the DaveNet Live session on Wednesday night, and got a positive response, so I thought I'd try it on a larger audience."/>
			<outline text="Here's the idea -- I'd like a small footprint, well-engineered, cross-platform web browser that implements the basic stuff, no emailer or plug-ins. Trust the OS to handle Java apps. Trust scripting to connect to email. No bookmarks. Just an HTML displayer and sound player with hooks for other apps. Built from the ground up to boot fast, be small, and run fast, and have lots of room for building stuff around it and on top of it. "/>
			<outline text="I think there will be sub-categories of browsers. It's too big a market to not be segmented. Some families have two or three machines. Different users have different needs. Now would be an excellent time for someone with a powerful brand to insert a second kind of browser into the mix, one that's fast and simple and easily extensible."/>
			<outline text="Remember how nice Norton Desktop was in its day? Something like that for the web would do well, I think. User-driven features and no hype. Would people who really use the web pay $149 to upgrade the experience even when Microsoft is giving away its browser? It's worth looking at."/>
			<outline text="***Readers"/>
			<outline text="I shared an idea with Roger Black, the conference chair for Seybold New York, a former print designer who now designs for the web. In the closing keynote yesterday, both of us on stage, I was giving my standard schpiel about large dynamic sites with lots of authors. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Three kinds of people,&quot; I say, &quot;designers, geeks and writers.&quot; Roger asks -- what about the fourth? &quot;The fourth?&quot; I ask. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Readers,&quot; said Roger. "/>
			<outline text="Yes! I already knew this -- why go to all the effort to create a dynamic news oriented website if not for the readers? But Roger's point might have been more subtle. If you edit a web-based front page, you want to include content that's written by readers. Writing in a vacuum is less interesting than writing that's connected, especially on the web, where you can implement connections with links. "/>
			<outline text="You also want to turn readers with interesing ideas who express them well into writers. I think this is the key to a good site -- it's a talent searching system. When someone who has ideas shows up, you want to incorporate their stuff into your flow. It's how seeds turn into trees. We're still learning how to do this. "/>
			<outline text="***No theories needed"/>
			<outline text="Just as the print publishing industry is transitioning to the web, the writers of the web are learning about journalism and editorial systems. We're learning how to write and how to edit without losing much of the energy and spontaneity of web writing. "/>
			<outline text="Former print journalists are learning that they're in a new medium, where lead-times melt to zero, where you can revise a story after it ships, just like television news. Communication is still done thru writing and still photos, like newspapers and magazines. And there are links -- when you discover something new on the web, tell your readers about it, and then take them there. They don't have anything like this in TV, radio or print."/>
			<outline text="After considering push, the web looks just right. Users can choose their own path thru the web, stories can link to other stories, and searchable databases can archive back issues. These are fundamental features of the web that are totally new and still mostly unexplored. "/>
			<outline text="The most interesting session for me was about online news reporting. I was in the audience, listening to people from Excite, New Jersey Online and the Wall Street Journal. Former print people who are totally turned on by the web. The audience is filled with people like them, people who are actually doing new exciting things, not just talking about doing them someday. "/>
			<outline text="No theories needed, no new technologies -- just a revolution whose heartbeat showed up in a dark hall in a convention center in New York. I can feel the convergence on a personal level, right where I live, in my heart, in my writing."/>

			<outline text="Right on! Developer relations is still a mating ritual. Even if there are Macs at JavaSoft, Java is still singin that song, saying come join us and then we'll decide if we like you. "/>
			<outline text="***Where Java is at"/>
			<outline text="Does Java really have an answer to the security problem? No, there's no smartness to the Java sandbox, no way to move stuff over the firewall. Java is a world unto itself, which means that users will store stuff there that they don't want to lose, and that stuff can be read or deleted by net-based agents. "/>
			<outline text="Is there any value in Java's cross-platform promise? Mac users don't want to use software that doesn't look and behave like Mac software. Same for Windows users, and I suspect Solaris users. Java has to find a niche where people don't use software. In the mainstream market there's no time to catch up."/>
			<outline text="Further, the Mac implementation of Java is falling behind the Windows and Solaris implementations, invalidating Sun's cross-platform pitch. "/>
			<outline text="***Will Java stay pure?"/>
			<outline text="Religious wars over language syntax are boring. Programming languages without environments are boring too."/>
			<outline text="Hey the Mac was supposed to be a Pascal operating system, another language that was presented as a panacea. Now you can write Mac apps in any language. Same for Windows. It'll be the same for the Java OS."/>
			<outline text="The 100-percent pure campaign is an attempt to bind the language to the environment, to buy Sun the time to write an operating system around Java. At the same time, people are porting Java to make it work inside all kinds of environments, not just the Java OS. "/>
			<outline text="***Java is Netscape"/>
			<outline text="Java is confusing. Is it an environment or a language? As a language it looks good. The environment is incomplete."/>
			<outline text="What they're doing at Sun is really simple. They're reimplementing all the pieces of Netscape Navigator 4.0. Where's the line? Java Beans looks like a browser. An emailer in Java is a no-brainer. Who's doing one? Look in the feature list for Netscape Navigator. That's where Java is headed."/>
			<outline text="Why do this? I have no answer. I don't even like all the extra things they've bundled with Netscape. I still use Eudora (and hate it!). "/>
			<outline text="***Web browser desktops"/>
			<outline text="I installed the Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 beta on my Windows machine, and I want to figure out how to get it off asap. "/>
			<outline text="I don't want the browser to take over my desktop! Please, a web browser is just a way to display formatted pages of text and graphics. It's not an excuse for engineers at Microsoft, Netscape and Sun to rewrite the rules on how I use my computer."/>

			<outline text="We reveal a lot about who we are thru writing. The facts hardly matter, it's how one parses them that reveals so much. A divorce is a way of speaking about yourself. So is a platform war. Who cares what the names are, it's the themes that are interesting."/>

			<outline text="Re-reading this piece took me to some interesting places. "/>
			<outline text="***Our hearts"/>
			<outline text="Life is so short. I remember when my parents were younger than I am now. As we grow older do our spirits get older too? I wondered then, but now I think not."/>
			<outline text="I think each of us has a kernel, under all the layers of experience and pain, that's ageless and perfect. Some people call this a heart, the organ that pumps blood thru our bodies. Others call it a spirit, the essence of the person. "/>
			<outline text="Whatever you call it, it's there, and you can easily find it."/>
			<outline text="***Proof that you exist"/>
			<outline text="Look at all the things that, when combined, equal you."/>
			<outline text="You're the sum of experience, intellect, emotions, a physical body and the space on earth that it occupies. An intellectual body, an emotional body, a physical and a spatial body. There are other bodies too -- recently we've created all-electronic bodies called websites. I'm sure we'll invent others as we evolve."/>
			<outline text="How do you know you have each of these bodies? Because you can experience them. Be a scientist, conduct an experiment. If you touch your body, can you feel it? If you have a thought do you realize it? If you feel anger or sadness or joy, can experience that too?"/>
			<outline text="But, is that the totality of what makes up a human being? No. "/>
			<outline text="The proof that you exist... Who's doing all that experiencing?"/>
			<outline text="That's you!"/>
			<outline text="***I am a point"/>
			<outline text="I believe that I am a point located, most of the time, about three inches behind my eyes and centered between my ears. The point is backed up by a powerful computer and memory system. "/>
			<outline text="This computer has some influence over what the body does, and I have some influence over the computer. Right now it's pushing pieces of plastic down, and then letting up, at a very high rate. These quick plastic-pushes create visual images that stimulate emotional and intellectual responses in me and, in a few minutes, you."/>
			<outline text="The computer also has functions that are automatic that I can't directly control. I understand that it keeps my &quot;liver&quot; and &quot;spleen&quot; functioning. I believe both these things are inside the body, even though I have no direct proof that they exist. "/>
			<outline text="My body has so many other features! It's cooool. For example, the same things that push the plastic down, fingers, can touch other things and other people in many different ways. And that's just the beginning. Breathing, eating, walking, swimming, flying -- my body can do all these things."/>
			<outline text="***Other points"/>
			<outline text="Most of the time the point is behind my eyes -- when I'm being visual. Yesterday I put my fingers on the tummy of a baby and lightly moved them around. Half a tickle, half caress. As I did that, the point moved from my eyes into my fingers!"/>
			<outline text="Then in an instant, as I connected to the eyes of the baby, the point moved back behind my eyes. I could feel them getting brighter! A connection was made, because the bright eyes showed up in the baby. Our spirits connected, we both laughed. "/>
			<outline text="You can connect to the spirit of a dog the same way. Or to the spirit of a sixty year old person. "/>
			<outline text="***Joy and ecstasy"/>
			<outline text="Satisfaction, pleasure, joy can come from touching your own point. Ecstasy, the most wonderful human state, comes from touching points with another. "/>
			<outline text="Joy is possible on your own. Heaven is when you connect with another."/>
			<outline text="Getting to that place, being in that place, comes from contact, not from being good or rich or successful. "/>
			<outline text="***What we believe"/>
			<outline text="Even so, we believe in houses, cars, clothes, mates, money and fame, even though they can take us far from our points. It's a tragedy that we give these beliefs to children by attaching value to them. When we do that we're passing on the pain, down thru the generations, one more time thru the loop."/>
			<outline text="However, because of a major change, thirty years ago, our race now has the opportunity to wake up from this bad dream. "/>
			<outline text="Here's why..."/>
			<outline text="***Birth control"/>
			<outline text="My parents' generation and all generations before, were different from us. They had children early in life because there was no effective birth control. There was no question whether you'd have babies or not. If you had sex, and your bodies were fertile (most are) you had kids."/>
			<outline text="Our ancestors moved directly from their parent's house into a new house containing two strangers and a kid. They hadn't completed growing up when they had their kids. If they had spent a few years living on their own, if they had had a life independent of their parents, they would have had a chance to define themselves before defining a new human being and passing on, unprocessed, what was given to them. "/>

			<outline text="***Forget it"/>
			<outline text="Our bodies grow older, every day there's more experience, more burdens to carry, more to overcome. But there's also an opportunity to send it all away, to let it go, and as it goes, to let go of other stuff too. "/>
			<outline text="Life can make you lighter if you let it. When your body dies you're going to let go of everything. Wheee! Can we have fun now? It's easy... Just forget something. After that, forget something else!"/>
			<outline text="***Breaking loops"/>
			<outline text="Our race has taken some wrong turns, I think. But so far, except for minor rebellions, we continue on the course set by previous generations, repeating the loops over and over, and because bodies grow old and die so quickly, it can be hard to even see the loop, much less understand how to break out of it."/>
			<outline text="Look at how powerful the previous generations are! My generation didn't invent cars or televisions or skyscrapers, planes or trains or telephones, we didn't even invent computers or software. Yet these concepts consume much of our attention, leaving little room for other experiences."/>
			<outline text="These are powerful distractions, but we can be powerful too. Our parents can be forgiven for trying to make sense of our lives in terms of their own, even though there had been a tremendous change. We can be forgiven too, for doing the same. Now, can we stop doing it?"/>
			<outline text="I want to keep my house and my car and my computer and my friends. I don't want to give them up. But I also want to stay centered on what's important and has lasting value. I'll take a hint from whoever created us this way -- go for the joy and ecstasy, and try to let go of the experience and the pain."/>

			<outline text="***The center of the universe"/>
			<outline text="Ask yourself to find the center of the universe. I know where it seems to be, it's in my point, the space three inches behind my eyes and centered between my ears. It's only on faith that I assume that there are other centers of the universe. The only one I can really perceive, with my limited sensor devices, is the one that's me."/>
			<outline text="Carl Sagan, in his stirring PBS series Cosmos, tells a great story about perceptions. A picture of earth from space. It fills the entire screen. It looks big and blue and beautiful.

			<outline text="My belief, which comes thru extrapolation, an induction on the joy we can experience as individuals, is that yes, there is a planetary consciousness, and its purpose is to connect with others. We can wake up from our dream and discover that there are other collections of consciousnesses called planets. And we can experience ecstasy first, in perceiving them, and then connecting with them.

The designer of the universe placed the moon so close to our planet so we could go somewhere at this point in our technologic evolution. We can get to the moon, we can survive there, and it costs a small fraction of what we create to do that."/>
			<outline text="In the 1960s we rushed to the moon. Let's go back with an intention to stay. I believe that we are not alone. We will continue to evolve. The next step is on our satellite. It's there, it's close, and we can go. "/>

			<outline text="Good morning people!"/>
			<outline text="I know this sounds geekish, but it pays to use the scientific method in relationships with other people. When conflicts arise, as they always do, instead of assuming you know why your friend is doing or saying something, take a deep breath, put on your lab coat, and ask them to describe their experience. "/>
			<outline text="Listen carefully. Remember this is a person you care about. This is not one of your ancestors (unless it actually is) and they are not behaving just like someone you know very well. "/>
			<outline text="***People change"/>
			<outline text="Just when you think you know someone, they change. Sometimes the change can come out in a confusing way. The simplest assumption is just that something about the person changed, nothing more. It can feel like you're being abandoned or betrayed, and in a sense you are. Your old friend is leaving, and a new one is taking his or her place. "/>
			<outline text="When a friend changes you can find the bond that's connecting you at a deeper level. The surface stuff isn't a good thing to depend on. Physical bodies change as they grow. So do emotional bodies and intellectual ones. Take a deep breath. People move, life is more like a wild dance than a ceremony. You just can't tell what's coming next. "/>
			<outline text="***Anger"/>
			<outline text="Anger is only dangerous if it's bottled up. If you deny it, run away from it, it'll come up anyway, it will find you, and in the process it could hurt you or others. "/>
			<outline text="Anger is a very powerful force. If it's allowed to release naturally, it can be a thing of beauty. It can be safe. A source of movement. It makes things happen. I believe that anything that expresses our true nature is beautiful, so when anger comes from inside, it's a source of beauty."/>
			<outline text="But when a raging firestorm of anger is directed at you, it can be hard to listen. But, if you can, or if it can be quickly re-channeled, a release of anger can be as spectacular as Old Faithful, the Hale-Bopp comet, or a huge plume of anti-matter at the edge of our galaxy. "/>
			<outline text="Anger is real. It can be truly gorgeous. "/>
			<outline text="***Struggles"/>
			<outline text="Is anyone really gliding thru life, unopposed, with nothing to say or prove, with nothing to overcome? Many people would have you believe this is the way for them, or that this is their goal. I don't believe it."/>
			<outline text="People you think aren't struggling are the ones with the biggest struggles. I know people who want to let go of everything, to become pure spirits, to let go of all their struggles, and just be love. I've even had this as my goal at times. Now I believe that this isn't possible, or even desirable. Sometimes, it's inevitable, a trance takes over, you become your emotions, or your intellect or your physical body. You just can't transcend it. "/>
			<outline text="What to do? Just as when a car goes into a skid, turn into it, let the trance take over, breathe deeply, straighten the wheels, and when you regain control, continue the trip. Too many friends try to grab the wheel, and that always ends in an accident."/>
			<outline text="***Reincarnation"/>
			<outline text="Some people believe in reincarnation. They believe that whatever you don't resolve in this lifetime becomes the struggle of the next one. According to reincarnation theory, you can and do take it with you."/>
			<outline text="Even if you don't believe in reincarnation, it's still clear that our struggles outlive our bodies. Put on your lab coat again. Think about the struggles your parents gave you, and the ones their parents gave them, and think about the ones you're passing on. You don't have to go too deep to find them. The welcome-wagon of parenthood! Parents have lots to say to their children, and children just soak it up."/>
			<outline text="***Programmers"/>
			<outline text="Programmers have a very precise understanding of truth. You can't lie to a compiler. Try it sometime. Garbage in, garbage out. Booleans, the ones and zeros, trues and falses, make up the world programmers live in. That's all there is! I think programming is deep, it teaches us about the non-cyber universe we live in. There's something spiritual about computers, and I want to understand it."/>
			<outline text="Programming is good training in the scientific method. For example, last week I spent five hours learning that &quot;50&quot; + 1 = 501 in my scripting system. That truth was available to me the instant I discovered the malfunctioning software, but it took five hours of investigating, digging in, and challenging assumptions before the truth was clear, and I could move on to the next problem."/>
			<outline text="Programmers build castles out of theorums. Every program is proof that certain input will produce certain output. We build more complex castles, and look for synergies that allow the generality we like and still be approachable in non-mathematical ways. In movies they call this suspension of disbelief. In programming we call it the user interface. Same idea."/>
			<outline text="In the last few years we've learned how to connect programs together producing meta-software built out of programs that come from many different places, from people who don't even know each other. An amazing evolution has been happening!"/>
			<outline text="When a programmer catches fire it's because he or she groks the system, its underlying truth has been revealed. I've seen this happen many times, a programmer languishes for months, &lt;a name=&quot;chippingAtEdges&quot;&gt;chipping at the edges&lt;/a&gt; of a problem. Then all of a sudden, a breakthrough happens, the pieces start fitting together. A few months later the software works, and you go forward."/>
			<outline text="This process can be very confusing viewed from the outside. If you're not developing the software yourself, you can still understand the process if you listen to and trust the programmer. It's a fascinating world inside the machine. When programmers connect with the truth, they want to tell you about it! I promise you. This can make many people uncomfortable, and that's so unfortunate."/>
			<outline text="I think, in some ways programmers, who live the scientific method, are better prepared for life than non-programmers, but the opposite is often assumed. We all have a visual image of the programmer, but this is just the outer package. A great programmer is a seeker of truth and beauty. Successful programmers know how to ask questions, and they know how to ask the *right* question. You can't go forward until that happens. A programmer is a rigorous scientist determined to coax the truth out of the ones and zeros. There's the beauty."/>
			<outline text="My pitch to programmers, which is far more revolutionary than any programming language or operating system can be, is to look for understanding where you find it, work with people you want to work with, and don't waste time with people who won't listen and aren't grounded in the truth."/>

			<outline text="This should be no mystery to writers. If there were a competition for writers that was as objective as a chess match, would a person with a word processor produce better copy than someone who uses a pencil and paper? Remember, in chess, time is an issue. When you need a quick result, someone who knows how to use a computer can beat one without one, every time."/>
			<outline text="The Kasparov story became interesting to me because it so captivated the web. It raised a question about people that people find intriguing -- what does it mean to be human?"/>
			<outline text="***Dr. Weil"/>
			<outline text="I've been reading Dr. Andrew Weil's website on HotWired and on the cover of Time. He's one of Time's 25 most influential Americans. Now he's going over to Pathfinder. Great growth for Dr. Weil, and for the rest of us who enjoy his writing. And what does he write about? Humans! Get a clue, after search engines, stocks, sports and erotica, the big topic on the web is going to be humanity."/>
			<outline text="Weil's approach works because he answers questions, for sure, but the reason it really works is that he *asks* questions. He gets you to think. He says controversial things. You're not sure if you agree. He gives you something to talk about, something to excercise your mind and your feelings. It's stimulating stuff, on a human level, because it takes us out of our normal lives, allows us to dream of others."/>

			<outline text="***Rigidity"/>
			<outline text="The software world is so locked in place, so rigid, moves so slowly. "/>

Much of the current content of the web is so self-referential. Such immature themes, such limited literature! Where's the depth?"/>
			<outline text="If you slice and dice things the way the software world tries to, it should be impossible for someone to be expressive in both literature and in software. I wish people who reduce the web to technology would take two weeks off and write their personal life story and put it on the web. Cut the marketing hype, who are you as a person? Did you know your parents? How many brothers and sisters? Were you first born? What are your basic beliefs and values? "/>

After months of swirling around issues of Apple's decline and the ascendance of Java, I felt it was time to take a look at the universe, your existence, bodies and spirits, personal and galactic. "/>
			<outline text="Now, in a more realistic context, who cares if Apple or Java wants to go it alone? Nothing is created in worlds without love. How many times do we have to learn this? They can go around the loop again, but do I have to go with them? No."/>
			<outline text="A friend asks if galaxies can love each other. There was a point to the question -- it's really happening here on earth, there's no need to look at the stars. My answer was a surprise. Yes, I believe galaxies can love each other. But first comes respect, and with respect, acknowledgement. So I do look to other galaxies... I can see, can't you? Both inside and out, it's such a big universe..."/>

			<outline text="A hot debate."/>
			<outline text="JavaScript versus AppleScript."/>
			<outline text="One is like C, and another is like English. It's an old debate that's still going on. The Unix folks, I imagine, tune out on AppleScript. It isn't a real programming language. If they look further they see a hacked-up partial implementation, something that looks good at first glance, but when you have to do something complex, the syntax gets ugly."/>
			<outline text="It isn't intuitive for complex things. It gives good demo, like so much of the software Apple has produced, but when it comes time to build a system, you're better off with parameter lists that look just like parameter lists."/>
			<outline text="It's an old debate that goes back to the arguments about Fortran versus Cobol. I remember them well. I chose Fortran, then Basic, then Simula, Pascal, and finally C."/>
			<outline text="The rules got progressively simpler. A procedure call is a name followed by a left paren, followed by a comma-separated parameter list, followed by a right paren. You can combine them to any level of complexity. That makes these languages scale up well. You don't hit walls as your programs get more complex."/>
			<outline text="Script writers don't get this. They think we're arrogant, but I write scripts too. I've learned what I've learned and I believe what I believe. "/>
			<outline text="***Gardening"/>
			<outline text="I started gardening seven years ago, and I'm still a beginner. I've never been to a class or a workshop, maybe I should, but I've read lots of books, and tried lots of experiments. This season I think I'm going to get some gorgeous Sunset-like displays of color. I'll let you know. "/>
			<outline text="I've learned a lot. I dig fertile holes, plant flowers that will probably not get eaten by snails and slugs. I've learned what plants like what spots. I've got a great snapdragon spot. My roses are working. Roses are the best!"/>
			<outline text="Even better, some of my projects of five years ago are starting to bear fruit -- quite literally. Tons of peaches, apples, plums and oranges. I keep them well watered and fed, and later this year they will feed me and my friends. A good deal. A win-win. "/>
			<outline text="A couple of weekends ago a friend who has a wonderful professional garden came for a visit. I took her on a tour of my garden. At every spot she had advice. I saw my garden in a different light, I noticed the weeds, not the blooms. Too much this, not enough of that. I had a lot of trouble listening and later, every time I visit my garden I think of her advice instead of tuning into what my bushes and plants and trees are doing."/>
			<outline text="***Am I a gardener?"/>
			<outline text="Yes. Even though there are better gardeners, gardening is a lifestyle, and I live in that style. I dream up new projects. I play with new ideas, I cut my losses on failed projects. I think I'm going to be a great gardener someday, and I don't care if other people have better gardens! I love mine, no one can take that away from me."/>
			<outline text="***Scripting is like gardening?"/>
			<outline text="Script writers say they don't want to be programmers. I still don't get this, because I think they already are programmers. They ask the same questions programmers ask, they have to debug their code just like programmers. They want their scripts to run fast (at least some do) and they want them to be easy to use. These are the same things that good programmers worry about. "/>
			<outline text="But in a recent debate on a scripting list, scripters are shouting loudly and religiously that they don't want to be programmers. It's the old debate, it comes up a lot, and now maybe I think I understand what all the angst is all about."/>
			<outline text="No one likes a superior attitude. It's distancing. I know something you don't. Your work isn't great, mine is. This kind of talk makes you run for the nearest exit. How to unsubscribe? Help!"/>
			<outline text="***I'm like my friend"/>
			<outline text="In 1992 we started something new, and since then I've been doing a lot more scripting and website building than programming in C. I've been blazing new trails, I was among the first people to build websites, so there were no experts to pick at my work. I never had to worry that someone was doing it better, when I saw something I liked, I added it to my repertoire, easily and quickly."/>

			<outline text="She's a fragile vulnerable rock star, an angry dreamer dressed in glitter, carrying a guitar, ready to go on stage. A mix of confusing songs, but that's the story she's telling. "/>
			<outline text="Midlife concerns, dreams of dancing on the Riviera, falling out of love in Rome. I wondered if I'd go for a new Sheryl CD, well I'm listening, her style is still appealing, her anger is still attractive. I like it."/>
			<outline text="She's been thinking about catching a train, leaving the phone by the radar range. "/>

			<outline text="***Gates"/>
			<outline text="On Fortune's cover David Kirkpatrick tells the story of the next big push from Microsoft. A sense of context you don't get from the trade weeklies, who make Java and the Network Computer seem like major hurdles for Microsoft to climb over. "/>
			<outline text="Kirkpatrick comes right at Gates. The Network Computer! says Kirkpatrick. "/>
			<outline text="In a new vigorous style, Gates dances his answer. That way! he points. That's where the competition is going. He starts running. There goes Sun, there goes Netscape. Heading for the hills."/>
			<outline text="***Heading for the hills"/>
			<outline text="Good move. The defensive position is the strongest. Netscape builds around their strong position in web browsers and Sun promotes Java. "/>
			<outline text="But Sun hobbles Java with a vague business proposition (closed licensing) and Netscape is going in very predictable directions, easy for Microsoft to anticipate. "/>
			<outline text="It's kind of nolo contendre watching the spinmasters at Microsoft dismiss Netscape and Sun. Too bad because Netscape could be the poster child for the web generation. Even the young people at Microsoft would dig this. What a missed opportunity. The software is so damned boring! Ohhh. If only..."/>
			<outline text="***IBM and innovation"/>
			<outline text="Both Sun and Netscape are repeating the strategic mistake that IBM made. They thought they were selling innovation, leading to OS/2, the PS/2 and the micro channel architecture, all of them strategic disasters."/>
			<outline text="When Microsoft claimed the top of IBM's hill in the early nineties, they immediately owned the strongest defensive position. The huge infrastructure of blue-suited IBM salespeople and system engineers proved to be a sustainable advantage, but their software philosophy wasn't broad enough, didn't attract enough developers, to have longterm value."/>
			<outline text="The loop has now closed on this chapter in IBM's history. They lost the top of the big hill to Microsoft. Sun, in partnership with Netscape, IBM and others want to take it back. But Gates is there, and he ain't going away. Yet, there is a way around Microsoft, to grab a different hill, one that Microsoft can't really own."/>
			<outline text="***Developers"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft does the developer game absolutely as well as they can, but they should be easy to compete with. Realistic developers understand that Microsoft is a growth machine, so if you're lucky enough to build a bonfire within Microsoft's reach, even a small one, they're going to try to build one of their own, just like yours. They have to do it, it's in their genetics, it's in their business plan."/>
			<outline text="So, if you can, zig to Microsoft's zag. If it's impossible for a developer to really trust Microsoft, make it possible for developers to really trust you. It has to be a structural promise, mere words aren't enough."/>
			<outline text="There could be an incredible distribution system for Netscape-Sun-compatible software, building win-wins and an incredible flow of new ideas -- but that's not what they're doing. "/>
			<outline text="***Luck"/>
			<outline text="When you're lucky enough to be at the center of a rising platform, as Sun and Netscape are, its best to kick back, fix the bugs, improve performance, promote the developers, sell like hell, and enjoy the rewards."/>
			<outline text="It's tempting to believe that more than luck was responsible, but what a burden that is. It's a philosophic challenge to define yourself after a lighting bolt of good luck strikes, but a company without a philosophy, or a weak one, has no future. "/>
			<outline text="We judge the strategies by the skirmishes and miss the major trend. Sun wants to control all the software, so does Netscape. Actions speak loudly, forget the words. It's about net-effect, not intentions. "/>
			<outline text="They're acting like little Microsofts and there's no room for them  as long as they approach the world this way. "/>
			<outline text="Of course it could still be fixed, every time around the loop that's possible."/>

			<outline text="The battle for the web is moving into high gear on the Microsoft and Netscape websites and on Jesse Berst's page on AnchorDesk. "/>
			<outline text="Jesse has a great concise piece that urges Netscape and Microsoft to work together to agree on one format for pushing web pages and sites at users."/>
			<outline text="http://www5.zdnet.com/anchordesk/story/story_945.html "/>
			<outline text="He makes some important points. Netscape's implementation of Marimba's Castanet protocol is interesting because for the first time Netscape is promoting a closed standard. I can't write a server to hook up to this new functionality in Netscape, only Marimba can because they haven't disclosed how their protocol works. "/>
			<outline text="This isn't necessarily bad, but until it's opened and other technologists can evaluate the protocols, I doubt if it's going to get much serious support in the web development world."/>
			<outline text="Without Marimba, Netscape doesn't have much more that could be called push or webcasting other than scheduled bookmarks and a web crawler, neither of which excite me as a web developer."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape has the hooks"/>
			<outline text="Berst urges Netscape and Microsoft to work together in the context of standards bodies to sort out their differences. "/>
			<outline text="I have a different idea. There's no need to wait for standards bodies, or to wait for both these companies to decide to cooperate with each other. "/>
			<outline text="Luckily Netscape's browser is open, to making it possible for Microsoft channels to be distributed thru Navigator as well as Internet Explorer. This is a very important thing. "/>
			<outline text="We don't have to wait for Netscape because anyone who can program an XML parser subset can add CDF support to Netscape, even old versions like 2.0 or 3.0. And we can deprive Microsoft of a competitive advantage over something as trivial as a new file format."/>
			<outline text="***More free code"/>
			<outline text="To prove that it can be done I wrote a CDF parser in Frontier's native scripting language, UserTalk. You can download it or view the source at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/fatPages/97/05/cdfParser.html "/>
			<outline text="Key point -- opening up software for scripting is a good thing for strategic reasons. In this case it saved Netscape the embarassment of having to implement Microsoft's format. If it proves to be important, if many CDF-formatted channels start appearing, you won't have to use Microsoft's browser."/>
			<outline text="It only took two sessions for me to write this parser. I doubt if this is any kind of barrier to entry. Only Netscape's pride could interfere, but they're scriptable, so it isn't an issue."/>

			<outline text="Jump in let's go. Lay back enjoy the show. Everybody gets high, everybody gets low. These are the days when anything goes! "/>
			<outline text="Every day is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Every day is a faded sign. I get a little bit closer. Every day is a winding road. I get a little bit closer. Every day is a faded sign. I get a little bit closer to feeling fine."/>
			<outline text="This song has such a nice rhythm. "/>
			<outline text="***Web browsers are a winding road"/>
			<outline text="The push hysteria is clouding out several important changes coming in Microsoft's web browser in version 4.0. Check this out -- the web is getting special effects. Marc Canter, the founder of Macromedia, and the guy I look to for advice on this stuff, says that Microsoft is bringing PowerPoint-like presentation effects to version 4.0 of their browser. Fades and disolves. Enter left, enter right. All the special effects that PowerPoint knows how to do. "/>
			<outline text="This makes sense. Microsoft surely has a mature code base and a mature understanding of this technology. PowerPoint has been on the market for ten years. They must know what customers want and have the code pretty well worked out."/>
			<outline text="I bet that PowerPoint becomes a pretty interesting web development tool after 4.0 ships. And I bet that PowerPoint will also integrate with the web browser pretty well because of the next change."/>
			<outline text="***Web browser as scripting environment"/>
			<outline text="In IE 4.0, it will be possible for scripts embedded in web pages to call Microsoft applications such as Word, PowerPoint, Access, and presumably all the Back Office server software. This means that the web browser can become the user interface for your web development environment. "/>
			<outline text="I think this is right-on. The more authoring commands you can put in the menu bar of the web browser, the smoother the experience. In this world, every editor becomes a web authoring tool. The same treatment could be done for picture editors, script editors/debuggers, whatever data types show up in web displays."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft gets it. The web browser is what OpenDoc was trying to be. The key was in getting the apps to wire in without having to rewrite the apps. They did it the lowest-cost way, and delivered it where it counts, in the web browser."/>
			<outline text="***Web browser as an outliner"/>
			<outline text="Outliners are hierarchy editors. Expand an item to reveal detail, collapse it to hide detail. If you point at an item and drag it to a new location, everything under it moves too. Control of detail and easy reorganization are the two defining features of outliners."/>
			<outline text="Whenever a hierarchy shows up, an outliner is a good idea. From one view, the web is a hierarchy of bookmarks, places you can go back to. Expand an item to reveal the pages it points to. Do it again and again. You can move things where ever you want, it's your view of the web, to tweak and reorganize as you see fit."/>
			<outline text="That's how bookmarks move into the future."/>
			<outline text="***Web browser as a platform"/>
			<outline text="If I were designing Microsoft's system software strategy around my own software I'd be doing it exactly the way they're doing it. I totally buy into the positioning of applications as web authoring tools, and the web browser as the runtime environment for the apps. My world is reassembling in Microsoft's web browser... As Sheryl sings, I'm a stranger in my own life. It's so true!"/>
			<outline text="As I said in &quot;Being Free&quot;, 5/9/95, my direction was very much influenced by a Gates speech in 1983, so fair is fair. They are getting it together at Microsoft. Hats off to them. Even so, one could accuse Microsoft of having a megalomaniac vision, of usurping the future of all other developers, but for one thing -- they're willing to let you wrap your own shell around their browser. They've already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/03/FatWebPages.html&quot;&gt;delivered this feature&lt;/a&gt; on the Mac, and they promise to go further."/>
			<outline text="So if I want to put together a UserLand web browser that works with our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/snippets/outlinerCribSheet.html&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/snippets/databaseCribSheet.html&quot;&gt;object database&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/matt/scriptingTutorial/&quot;&gt;script editing environment&lt;/a&gt;, they're willing to be my runtime, on my terms, without control over the features I put into my runtime."/>
			<outline text="Furthermore, we can collaborate with NetObjects or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/bbEdit/&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt;, or Quark or Symantec. Borland or Oracle databases. Novell stuff. We don't have to flow all our ideas thru Microsoft's scripting engine. "/>
			<outline text="That one little bit of openness makes everything possible, especially if this willing-to-take-a-back-seat attitude is balanced by a similar offer by Netscape. We can really go forward. At a technology level, browsers can be the user interface for all kinds of scripted connections, not just environments created by Netscape and Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="So, if it works technically will it work from a positioning standpoint? Will the press buy it? Will Microsoft get in the way?"/>
			<outline text="***Think Seybold"/>
			<outline text="I don't choose to compete with Windows or Word or PowerPoint or MSIE. I took my own advice -- I headed for the hills, a long time ago! Run run run. There goes Dave. "/>
			<outline text="I want to make a cross-platform web publishing system that's attractive to the Seybold crowd, large site publishers with lots of authors, with editorial workflow needs. To separate content from design, to be in a position to support all new transports by flipping a switch. A programming platform for large scale web sites with hooks into the apps and databases."/>
			<outline text="I remember what it was like to fit in next to Apple, even when our offerings were very different, aimed at different people with different purposes. Unfortunately, the computer press is a very crude device, they see the size of the company first, then they look at the software. They see conflict first and see collaboration with a suspicious eye. They believe in the big boys, not in breakthroughs, or new markets or garage shops. They gravitate to the faceoffs, turning leadership into dueling sumos or kamakazis. The world's pretty flat and unsegmented as the computer press views it. I've done countless experiments to see if anything has changed, and they all come up with the same result, no change."/>
			<outline text="Knowing this, I'm reluctant to invest in a comparison that I know will be unfair. Will Microsoft help the reporters and reviewers understand the differences, or as Apple did, encourage them to overlook or sidebar software that doesn't come from Microsoft? If left alone, the press will probably dismiss our stuff. If Microsoft won't proactively support us, as I parse it, there's no reason to continue to invest."/>
			<outline text="***Life is a winding road"/>
			<outline text="I find this exhilarating, not depressing! It requires a lot of work and mothering to ship a product as complex as Frontier. The port to Windows, a cross-platform release, is the most complex shipment we've ever attempted. After that, many years of work remain, as the web world develops, as the road twists and turns. That'll be fun, but only if its a money-making proposition. "/>
			<outline text="If Microsoft respects us, as they should, they will proudly tell the press that we're doing something important with lasting value for their platform. At some time the microphone will pass to me. Will the audience applaud? Will investors clamor to get some of the action? That's my dream!"/>
			<outline text="My bottom-line, I'd like to find a way to fit in, with power and respect."/>
			<outline text="What do you think?"/>

			<outline text="***The Best Way to Build Web Pages by Jesse Berst"/>
			<outline text="When I talk to most Web site designers, I can't help but think about salmon. The way they swim upstream. Defiantly fighting the current. Over and over again. The difference? Salmon don't have a choice. "/>
			<outline text="You do. Your database could be doing the hard work instead. "/>
			<outline text="If you're like most people, you still build Web pages one... at... a... time. What many of you should be doing instead is separating content from format. You create the content in a database (type in text, specify which graphics you want, etc.). Then the database pours that content into preformatted templates to create HTML pages. Since content and format are separate, you can change them independently. If you want to give all your pages a new look, you simply change one template. (Compare that to changing each page manually one at a time.) "/>
			<outline text="Database-driven Web pages come in two flavors. &quot;Snapshot&quot; pages are created when the database outputs HTML pages that are then placed on the Web server. At that point, they're like any other page (a Web server doesn't care what tool you use). &quot;Dynamic&quot; pages are built &quot;on-the-fly.&quot; They don't exist until a browser makes the request, at which time the database pours the right content into the right template instantaneously. "/>
			<outline text="Either way, the database does most of the tedious work. "/>
			<outline text="A database-driven Web site has other advantages, too: "/>
			<outline text="* Consistent look and feel. Pages are poured into uniform templates. "/>
			<outline text="* Easy to update and maintain. No more waiting on Webmasters to update information by hand. "/>
			<outline text="* Simple to administer. Ensuring site integrity is much easier because the database keeps track of all the linked pages (even if there are thousands of them). "/>
			<outline text="Why am I so bullish on building Web pages with a database? Because I have personal experience with its benefits. The pages you see on AnchorDesk are all built automatically by our custom authoring database, created by Technical Director Jon DeKeles. "/>
			<outline text="Slowly but surely, Web publishers are discovering the database difference. For instance, when RCA took a hard look at its site last year, it was stunned to discover the costsand the limitationsof its manual approach. So it hired a Chicago-based firm to conduct an overhaul. And it was delighted by the results. "/>
			<outline text="Slowly but surely, a few vendors are catching on too. Like Vignette, which sells the database-driven StoryServer product. But most don't. Not even Microsoft, which could modify Access to create a killer Web site development tool. "/>
			<outline text="Two reasons why companies are hesitant to switch to the database approach. First, it requires an upfront investment of time and effort. It's a lot slower to get your first pages out but heyyou have to spend time to save time. Second, it requires a change in thinking. Most vendors are still treating Web publishing as if it were closely related to desktop publishing. "/>
			<outline text="In the future, I think all Web sites larger than 50 pages should be database-driven. So don't swim upstream if you don't have to. Go with the flow. Make life  easier for yourself by investigating database publishing for Web pages. "/>

			<outline text="A friend is reading Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, a book that had profound influence on me when I was sixteen and in later years. At the same time I re-read The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. "/>
			<outline text="They're two sides of the same coin, one a teenage message, a fantasy of egoism, a view that says that only some people count; the other documents what happens when people buy into that view. One book is fiction and the other tells a story that really happened."/>
			<outline text="The books make an interesting contrast. Do they explain anything about our times? Yes. The deification of mortals still happens, and arts and crafts and humanity continue to be displaced, connections with our nature are lost, today, just as they were in the industrial revolution."/>
			<outline text="***Atlas Shrugged"/>
			<outline text="The premise of Atlas Shrugged is that some men and women are greater than others. We depend on them. The great people, people with deep moral and intellectual superiority, get fed up and go on strike. The planet falls apart. They are missed. &quot;Please come back!&quot; everyone says. They come back. "/>
			<outline text="A captivating story, well-told. A dichotomy. Gods and godesses walking the earth among masses of inferior mortals with no philosophy. People who are more valuable than others. "/>
			<outline text="It's a popular story with teenagers. After a whole (short) lifetime getting messages of inferiority from adults, it's a relief to find your own greatness, to plan a positive life with major accomplishments and adventures ahead of you. The adults promised you less, Atlas Shrugged is a vote for more."/>
			<outline text="As teens, it validated our sense of inadequacy. No one appreciates me! I'll just go away, to Galt's Gulch, they'll miss me then! Hey it's better than teen suicide. It's better than drug abuse and pregnancy too, all of which also relieve teen boredom. Unfortunately when you come back from this dream, you find that you still have to love and be loved, something we knew when we were babies, but lost being raised in a society without philosophy."/>
			<outline text="Atlas Shrugged is an unconscious message. It's permission to be sloppy, to stop listening, to stop learning, to be closed to other experiences and other points of view. As long as you're moving technology forward, making more money, you needn't think any further. Ignore any contradictory information you receive. "/>
			<outline text="A better message for young people is that there is no mathematical formula that allows ranking of whole human beings, that everyone is great, including you. It could save them years of learning that on their own. To be a happy adult, I think, you have to appreciate the greatness all around you, including other people, including yourself. "/>
			<outline text="The self-centered approach of childhood gets ugly and smelly as it grows old. To have fun, to make a difference, you have to smell the roses. Really smell them! "/>
			<outline text="And the apple and peach blossoms too..."/>
			<outline text="***The Grapes of Wrath"/>
			<outline text="Steinbeck tells a story of a culture disbanded in the name of progress. Agriculture transforming to agribusiness. A lifestyle becomes an industry. "/>
			<outline text="It's easy to see the disposessed as whiners or communists, but Steinbeck says they were lovers and artists. We used to eat only food that was hand-prepared, every bit connected to the earth by humans, not huge machinery. A cooperative venture between the plant and animal kingdoms and the earth. Food had responsibility, it had soul. It gave us grounding, which is something we need, something we lost."/>
			<outline text="Steinbeck writes passionately about the lost connection. I experience it myself. The peaches I grow taste better than the ones you buy in the store. I experience this as nutrition, as opposed to fill. Food instead of sludge."/>
			<outline text="Steinbeck writes about food and land and people, but the lessons apply equally to the late 1990s, but now we're fighting for the nourishment of human intellect, feelings and ideas, instead of mere food. "/>
			<outline text="We accepted mass production of food, then shortly after that we accepted mass production of story-telling. When was the last time you watched a movie that wasn't a $25 million-plus production job? When was the last time you read a book that wasn't on the New York Times bestseller list or listened to music you hadn't heard fifteen times on your favorite FM radio station?"/>
			<outline text="What happened to word of mouth and campfires and personal story-telling? Do you believe people who write under big mastheads more than you do people who speak for themselves?"/>
			<outline text="***The mystic view"/>
			<outline text="The mystic view is that life is a mystery. Rand claimed to have a complete philosophy of life, without any mysticism, but it was just filler for a society that had lost its way, that had no tradition of wonderment, no philosophy. The age of science gives up on science. There was and is still so much to discover, but Rand copped out, gave the responsibility to human gods, and then wrote off everyone else."/>
			<outline text="Technology is a fun distraction, but it's given so much more importance. Watch TV and read the popular press and you get the idea that there's only so much happening on this planet. There are five big TV networks, so there will be five big websites. Yuck!"/>
			<outline text="Cable TV is bigger than network TV, but it isn't more open to different points of view. Entertainment should teach. What lessons do we learn on TV, and how do they help us be happier better grounded humans? Entertainment should move us and inspire us. How much diversity is there? Do you care? Commercials are great. Where's the beef?"/>
			<outline text="We debate the wrong things. We ask if Clinton is an adequate president, but we never ask if we need a president, or what we expect a president to do. We live in sludge! The software companies fight their battles in courts and in Washington. People in power are sloppy, they spread their unhappiness and confusion."/>

			<outline text="***Chris Nolan"/>
			<outline text="From Chris Nolan, cnolan@sjmercury.com, columnist at the San Jose Mercury-News: &quot;It's like Pogo. We have met the Okies and they are us. A lot of the people forced west by the dust bowl came to the valley and got jobs in the defense business. Once the war started, they built airplanes, tanks and guns. So, if you're born and raised here, the Okies could be your grandma and grandpa.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Arun Gupta"/>
			<outline text="From Arun Gupta, gupta@mrspock.mt.att.com: &quot;Perhaps the typical American teenager take on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is what you say it is. It was very different for me, in several aspects, growing up in India, a democratic but socialist country."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Atlas Shrugged told me that what other people want of me is not automatically right -- there are objective criteria, a demand of reasonableness that must be applied. Technology and making money are irrelevant, really, it is about discovering and then doing what is right and not bowing to unreason. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Atlas Shrugged taught me that it's important to let people grow to as full a stature as they can. I did not read it as there are gods and goddesses and there are inferior mortals. Instead, there are people who try their hardest and best to do good jobs, and there are the slackers and the parasites. (Socialism breeds parasites and corruption faster than anything else known). "/>
			<outline text="&quot;I come from a very different cultural and social setup than yours, and it is interesting to see what different messages we've received from the same book. Perhaps that is the sign of great art; that it doesn't force you to see things in a particular way so only some people can see it and others don't.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="From Wesley Felter, wesf@mail.utexas.edu. &quot;Society acknowledges that extraordinary people exist, but there's no attempt to accommodate them. Conformance is important; if you see things that other people don't, just be quiet, don't attempt to change things.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Wes is a student at the University of Texas in Austin, and one of the most respected people in the Frontier scripting community. "/>
			<outline text="***My thoughts"/>
			<outline text="I felt the same way when I was Wesley's age, now I see it differently. If you're exceptional, you'll find your own way. The ability to express your uniqueness, and be heard, is some measure of how exceptional you are. If you want help, look for adults who see the brilliance in your eyes and listen to what they have to say."/>
			<outline text="On the other side, any adult can make an enormous difference to a young person.  If you want to make the world a better place, give a young person a hug -- right now! That's the insulation we need -- friendship between young people and mature people. That's how we'll develop a new philosophy for our society."/>
			<outline text="***Grapes of Wrath"/>
			<outline text="The closing chapter of The Grapes of Wrath is amazing! I wish I could point to it on a website. Lawyers: would it be fair use to put it on the web, with an introduction and a literary point of view?"/>

			<outline text="***Try it, you'll like it!"/>
			<outline text="My Scripting News site is growing very fast. Lots of stuff is happening, and the web is a much better way to deliver the broader story. I use email sparingly, it seems more intrusive. Lots of stories and links go on the news page, often far in advance of their coverage in these email reports. "/>
			<outline text="The lines are separating, more and more, each flow of content is developing its own identity. So if you like what you're getting in DaveNet, a daily dose is available on the web. News and commentary from the cross-platform scripting community. We take a broad view. We make connections. We learn new things and draw new people into the community, that's how it grows."/>

			<outline text="I admit it -- I'm a programmer, a writer, and a minimalist when it comes to designing templates for pages on my sites. Our web management software is used by technical people, but we want to work with visual designers so that our automated sites have great looks too. "/>
			<outline text="In other words, brains are great, but sex appeal is important too."/>
			<outline text="***It's a market"/>
			<outline text="The home page at www.scripting.com changes several times each day, with new original stories, and links to stories that interest people who manage scripted websites. "/>
			<outline text="We take the broad view of the interests of scripting people. Issues of humanity and free speech are just as important as issues of push technology. We're interested in the struggles of Scott McNealy, Larry Ellison and Bill Gates, *and* Ayn Rand and John Steinbeck and the Supreme Court."/>
			<outline text="***Welcoming designers"/>
			<outline text="Great websites are the result of collaboration between geeks, designers and writers. If everything's humming, there are a few geeks, a few designers, and lots of writers. Content separated from form. Dynamic elements on static pages. Low cost serving and lots of choices of transport methods. "/>
			<outline text="Scripting is facilitation. If the software is good, the geeks, designers and writers work together without getting in the way. So I believe it's important to integrate the work of visual designers in geekish websites. If we don't do that well, we lose. "/>
			<outline text="Now we want to welcome our artistic brothers and sisters to become part of our world, and to do so, we're offering a chance to redesign our bread and butter, the home page of our site -- our crown jewel!"/>
			<outline text="***The challenge"/>
			<outline text="Take a look at http://www.scripting.com/. Get the HTML source of the page, play with it, see if you can make it more visually appealing, then post the resulting page on your web server, and send me an email pointing to your page. I'll link it in for all the Scripting News readers to look at."/>
			<outline text="When a winning design is clear, I'll change the template on the page to use the new view. The page will have link to the winning site at the bottom of the page, so we'll share the flow and goodwill the new design creates."/>
			<outline text="It's recursive. We use the home page to redesign the home page. Very cool!"/>
			<outline text="***Design guidelines"/>
			<outline text="The home page is a dynamic page. It changes several times a day, most days. Readers want to quickly see if anything new and interesting has been posted to the page. The key word here is &quot;quickly&quot;."/>
			<outline text="I think we can use some more graphics, but they need to be small. It must be possible to read the items on the page *before* all the graphics load."/>
			<outline text="It may make sense to have a graphic-rich version of the home page and a plain text version. This would be easy to implement because the page is built with scripts, it's no extra work for the sysop (me!) to build two versions of the page."/>
			<outline text="Tour the rest of the pages on the server, use the &quot;Directory&quot;. Many of the sites use templates that are inspired by this template. You may get some ideas of the design constraints."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Dinner With A Designer&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/9/97; 6:22:28 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Last week I had dinner with Marney Morris, marney@animatrix.com."/>
			<outline text="Marney is a designer. She made a career out of developing tours, demos and corporate info systems using Macromedia Director. Recently, Marney and her team have been doing beautiful and fun websites, including the site for the Disney movie 101 Dalmations. I last wrote about Marney in &quot;It's HTML, Dummy!&quot;, 12/6/96."/>
			<outline text="Marney loves her horses, and after years of doing design, very successfully, even though she's buzzin with ideas, she's retiring to teach at Stanford. She quotes a friend who says &quot;When you're involved in education, you never ask yourself 'Why am I doing this?'&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I totally get it. I'd like to teach too. At Stanford? You bet. Makes sense to me."/>
			<outline text="***Parking lot conversation"/>
			<outline text="I always wondered why content products have so much prettier user interfaces than apps do. Does it have to be so? Such beautiful web sites, displayed in such an inelegant user interface, the browser."/>
			<outline text="I think the current implementations of Netscape and Microsoft are ineffective. They use too much vertical screen real estate. There are only a few buttons that are truly important. The operations you use often could be iconified, I thought, and it could all be in one row, leaving more vertical room for writing and dynamic HTML stuff."/>
			<outline text="So, in the parking lot, after dinner, I asked Marney a question -- how could the design of web browsers be improved? It's an interesting question, I think, that few designers ask themselves. People focus their designs on what goes *inside* the browser window, but what if she could re-design the window itself? What would it look like?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Oh sure,&quot; she said. &quot;Not a problem.&quot; Then her eyes started to shine. I listened to her talk as she explained how she re-arranges things on coffee tables. Yes, I imagined she could do it. So right then and there, I issued a design challenge. &quot;Do it!&quot; I said. And so she did."/>
			<outline text="***The result"/>
			<outline text="Here's Marney's redesign of the top portion of the web browser window:"/>
			<outline text="{imageRef (&quot;marneyBrowser&quot;)}"/>
			<outline text="The top of the window is simplified. Four buttons to the left, a place to type, followed by four buttons."/>
			<outline text="The first button, a left-arrow, takes you back; the second button, a right-arrow, takes you forward. A picture of a home, lifted from the original navigator, HyperCard, takes you home, where ever that might be (it can be different for everyone). Marney likes the Search button, so it has a home in the command bar too."/>
			<outline text="Then the biggest UI element in the browser control panel, the URL displayer and entry box. You know how that works. As the URL gets too long to fit in the smaller space, it scrolls horizontally. In this new design, with less horizontal space, the scrolling happens sooner. Not a big deal."/>
			<outline text="To the right of the URL box is a stop icon for people with slower net connections (or for pages on the Pathfinder website) followed by a Reload button that really works, and a Print button, and finally an icon identifying the browser manufacturer. Click on it and you go to www.netscape.com or www.microsoft.com. That's enough advertising for my user interface, thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***Comments"/>
			<outline text="As always, comments are welcome. If you have your own design to share, post it to a web page and send me the URL and I'll link it into the Scripting News page."/>
			<outline text="This design stuff sure is interesting!"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Macromedia Flash&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/9/97; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I've spent the last few days hanging out with Marc Canter. He's working on a dynamic HTML site to show off features of Internet Explorer 4.0. "/>
			<outline text="Last night we got side-tracked, he showed me Paul Allen's website with a Flash-equipped web browser. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.paulallen.com/ "/>
			<outline text="I was blown away! What a gorgeous home page. "/>
			<outline text="***Great for brochures"/>
			<outline text="Flash is perfect for a site that's basically a brochure. Text flies in from the right, gets larger as it finds its place at the left margin. A sun-like cloud moves to the right and up and gets smaller. A bit of text appears where it lands. It moves. More text appears. A picture fills in."/>
			<outline text="The whole sequence takes about 30 seconds. It's stunning. I'm sure this kind of animation will become the norm on presentation oriented websites. "/>
			<outline text="Just as animated GIFs invaded the web, special effects are coming next, and it appears as if Macromedia got there first, with a development tool and a runtime."/>
			<outline text="***Tools tools tools (and scripting)"/>
			<outline text="Flash is important because it has a mature development tool, and at this time, dynamic HTML does not. I'm sure Macromedia will make Flash generate Netscape and Microsoft-compatible web graphics, and if they do, they have a product that's worth learning to use now."/>
			<outline text="It's even more important that Macromedia's more powerful Director be positioned as a development tool for dynamic HTML."/>
			<outline text="Also, if the development tools are scriptable they can be hooked into CGI applications for truly dynamic HTML, not just stuff that moves, but stuff that displays timely information. "/>
			<outline text="Recalculating graphics is an important direction, and I believe scripting support is the key technology in making this happen quickly."/>
			<outline text="***Installation"/>
			<outline text="With MSIE 4.0 you do almost no work to install the Flash plug-in. Visit the Macromedia site. A dialog appears saying you don't have the plug in. OK. A brief download and a confirmation with a certificate confirms that you want to install it. "/>
			<outline text="You don't have to restart the system or the browser. Text starts moving, a little, awards awkwardly tumble into position. Lots of commercial messages. "/>
			<outline text="***Flash uses vectors"/>
			<outline text="At a technical level, Flash is more efficient that the GIF and JPEG bitmaps that populate websites now. There's no reason why it shouldn't be as quick to download as HTML text. And of course HTML is going that way in the next browsers from Netscape and Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="***Times Square"/>
			<outline text="Someone should do a site that scrolls the news in an entertaining way using a Flash file in a web page that refreshes every 30 seconds."/>
			<outline text="***WebCollage"/>
			<outline text="Check out StarNine's WebCollage, a little-known product that's pioneering this area. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.webcollage.com/ "/>
			<outline text="***Good stuff, not-so-good stuff"/>
			<outline text="As with animated GIFs, some of the stuff will be ugly and distracting. "/>
			<outline text="I remember when Alta Vista started running animated ads that pulled down menus with unseen ghosts typing into a text entry field. Totally burnt my braincells. Goodbye Alta Vista, my old friend. I switched to Excite and Infoseek and Hotbot."/>
			<outline text="Good taste will be appreciated! Allen's site is wonderful and appropriate. The Macromedia site is pretty, at first, but gets old really quickly. "/>
			<outline text="Take the high road if possible, ease into this stuff."/>
			<outline text="***Flash-back"/>
			<outline text="I wrote about Flash 1.4 years ago, in &quot;Charlie Has a Dream Too&quot;, 1/5/96."/>
			<outline text="I said &quot;If Charlie and company can really deliver the technology, it's a no-brainer -- everyone is going to want this stuff.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/11/97; 6:40:35 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I was lucky in the summer of 1994, almost three years ago -- I was just about finished with an eight-month sabbatical, forced on me by two broken relationships. I had a lot of healing to do, and I did it by stopping everything I was doing. That's how it always works, if you're lucky you get another chance after things break. I got my body and spirit into shape. Did some traveling and reading, and exploring of myself. "/>
			<outline text="I was ready for a new challenge when the big buzz started about Mosaic and the web and the standards of the Internet. I started sharing my ideas with friends via email, that's how DaveNet began, and I left a trail behind me on a website, at a variety of places, and eventually started my own server at www.scripting.com, where DaveNet now resides."/>
			<outline text="I was lucky. I had the free time and energy to explore the new medium when it was young, before the power grabbers of the software industry started fighting over it. You can see the loop start, thru DaveNet, check out &quot;Stalin Go Home!&quot; written in early 1996, when it was clear that the web was going to become a battleground. "/>
			<outline text="I felt protective of Netscape, the darling poster child of the web generation, but felt even more protective of the freedom that the web represented. I didn't want the government invading, or Microsoft -- but there was no way to stop it. "/>
			<outline text="Given the turn of events I can't blame Microsoft for having defended the web as if it were their own. Re-reading the pieces I wrote about Java in April of this year, it's clear that even if Microsoft hadn't invaded, Sun probably would have, on its own, linked the value of its stock to the growth of the net using Java as the vehicle, and used it as a weapon to undermine and defeat Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="***Something is being lost"/>
			<outline text="I already feel like I'm practicing an old art, much like a scribe or a vaudevillian, pretending the world still needs me, even after the advent of the printing press or moving pictures. In the power deals of the media industry, DaveNet is overlooked. Being right, or controversial, or stylish, counts for nothing. It's who you know, what masthead you appear under, that matters to the titans of the new media business."/>
			<outline text="***Mastheads"/>
			<outline text="That said, this month I appear under a powerful masthead -- on the cover of Wired,  with a piece that exposes the hypocrisy of Java and its owners."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/javaWired.html "/>
			<outline text="***On the other hand"/>
			<outline text="I know that the web is a writing and reading medium. I know it in my soul. It may be a lot of other things, it may be a desktop, or a Java platform, or a chance for Ziff-Davis to beat up IDG, for Sun to defeat SGI or Microsoft. These are young-male goals, creativity expressed thru physical prowess. Hey, McNealy is a hockey player. It's OK. It's a great sport... but I think there's something else. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="When I see C|Net pulling the GIFs off their home page so people with 28.8K modems can get to the stories more quickly, I see things shaking out as I feel they should. Rational voices are being heard above the din of gratuitous graphics. Design is the art of making things more usable, not in overwhelming you with prowess."/>
			<outline text="I went to Netscape's press conference yesterday, and heard a lot of chest beating, corporate agendas, fear and power-grabs. The web being turned into a client-server platform. The s-word (standards) being used all over the place, to mask their probable concern that what they're doing may *not* become the standard. I asked why no style? Oh that's for content people. OK. "/>
			<outline text="But the world doesn't split so nicely into Content People and Other People. Content is such an awful word! What do I do? Hmmm. Is it content? That's like saying a great sunset is &quot;light&quot;. Sure, oh yes, that's what it is. But it misses the point. It misses the movement, the inspiration, the soul-gathering and unification that comes from knowing that 80 million people are watching the same sunset, each in their own way all at the same moment in time, each from their own point of view."/>
			<outline text="***It's an artistic medium"/>
			<outline text="I do electronic art. The web was a perfect transition for me since it showcases geekish art and written art, using a narrow pipe to transmit humor and ideas. The broader the pipe, the better, I guess. But let's go slowly I say. You can make great goosebumps with just a 14.4K line. And in doing so, the restraints are what make the expression interesting. How did he do that? How did he make me feel that way? Words are so damned powerful. They make you pay attention. That's coool."/>
			<outline text="So here's a vote for art. Great tunes, written and sung. A nice melody that everyone can hear. Who cares about corporate databases? They're so boring! I wish I never got another bill or had to write another check. If you can make that easier, more power to you. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape has gone from being the darling of the web generation to being the servant of the client-server world. We've been there and done that, there's only so much innovation possible there and little in the way of inspiration."/>
			<outline text="The real cultural upheaval will come from new ideas, and despite the noise, I'm confident that it will shake out, it's still coming, the big wheel will keep on turning, and when we're ready to move on, new ideas will win out over been there done that."/>

			<outline text="Why is it that interesting things always come in threes?"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday morning I was writing about style. Later the same day a demo shows me a way to have my own style applied to other people's content. "/>
			<outline text="And then in the evening, a pointer to a shareware product that allows me to take ads off sites so I can view the pages without commercial messages."/>
			<outline text="***WebFree"/>
			<outline text="WebFree is a Mac-only product. It hooks into the TCP stream at a very low level, looks for HTTP requests, parses the result before passing it back to the requesting app, which almost certainly is a web browser application such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer."/>
			<outline text="http://www.falken.net/webfree/ "/>
			<outline text="With any luck -- the effect is -- no more ads!"/>
			<outline text="Oooops. "/>
			<outline text="***It's deja vu all over again"/>
			<outline text="I first wrote about 'ad scraping' in November 1995 in &quot;New Cave Needs Curtain&quot;. I was in Boston at the InternetWorld show, having a blast, meeting new amazing people, dancing and (as I used to say back then) humming and wailing."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Advertising on the web is cool. But there's a fly in the ointment.... People are figuring out how to get the info from Yahoo, InfoSeek, Lycos and WebCrawler without seeing the ads. I find this fascinating.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="***You can observe a lot just by watching"/>
			<outline text="Many of the website IPO babies of 1996 are struggling to keep their heads above water. C|Net takes more money from Intel, Excite gets a cash infusion from Intuit, InfoSeek is in turmoil. "/>
			<outline text="It seems that the the advertising supported website model hasn't created profitable growing businesses. Maybe it will someday, but not yet."/>
			<outline text="***Making money on the web"/>
			<outline text="This raises the question -- is there a way to make a website pay? Everyone wants to know. The answer is clearly yes. Netscape's website makes money because it supports the sale of Netscape's software products. You can see this clearly in Netscape's latest strategic moves, they're focusing on the large corporate systems market. It's certain that their website will follow, providing more free, non-advertising-supported content to disseminate information about the products they sell to audiences they wish to influence and inform."/>
			<outline text="Excite is thin in software, therefore the barriers to entry are low and there's little differentiation between it an other general-purpose websites. Netscape has plenty of differentiation, as does Intuit and Intel. That's why the flow of capital is going in that direction. Excite can act as a distribution system for Intuit, and C|Net can help Intel use the cash their chip business generates to help it extend its influence in other industries."/>
			<outline text="Another example, a website for a movie is itself an advertisement, even if it contains clips from the movie, and free information about the actors, or historic or geographic background information. You may visit the website before or after seeing the movie, feeding the word of mouth system with new insights, and you may see the movie again when it comes out in video form."/>
			<outline text="Sponsorship is another option, one that I'm considering for Scripting News. When you cover an area of strategic importance to companies that are active in the area, they have an incentive to see you have more resources, to grow to better inform developers and users. Companies that have a stake in moving forward rapidly can benefit from sponsorship of an independent source of news and commentary."/>
			<outline text="In other words &quot;Scripting News&quot; is an advertisement for scripting, just as the San Jose Mercury-News is an advertisement for San Jose. Any business that depends on the growth and profit of San Jose is interested in seeing the Mercury-News grow and profit."/>
			<outline text="Like software copy protection in the mid-80s, web advertising may be on the way out. Advertising on websites seems to have small value in the greater flow of economic interest. It pays to look at other possibilities."/>
			<outline text="***Content separated from form"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I met with Dan Shafer, dan@gui.com, and Laurence Rozier, thepattern@hotmail.com. I've known them for quite a few years; they're both scripting guys. We've even worked together -- Dan wrote the original Frontier docs in 1991 and Laurence taught me the importance of environments to scripting languages."/>
			<outline text="They're working in an area that really interests me, customized presentation of net-based stuff. They have a prototype system implemented entirely in JavaScript, running in Netscape's browser. An example, you can click a checkbox to eliminate any images greater than 50K from all pages you browse. They implement rules that get into your flow and make it just the way you like it. It's the same idea as WebFree, but implemented at a much higher, more general, more reliable and powerful level."/>
			<outline text="But there's a brick wall they can't work around -- there's no way for their scripts to store and retrieve persistent data, so they can only dream about content separated from form."/>
			<outline text="I want Dan and Laurence to win because I have two content flows that are begging to be pushed thru a beautiful user interface, without compromising bandwidth. And somehow I believe that scripting is going to be central to making this work, and as you know, I am perenially interested in scripting."/>
			<outline text="***So many choices"/>
			<outline text="There's a lesson we're all learning -- pushing bitmaps around the net is intolerably wasteful, but people still want things to look better. Today's personal computers are vast computing and data storage resources that aren't being well used. New flexibility, new formats, that's certainly coming. "/>
			<outline text="That's why I'm interested in &quot;MacroMedia Flash&quot;, Shockwave and (believe it or not) Java-based displayers. Whatever it takes to make it happen. So many choices! I want the web browser to become a fully powerful scripting system with persistent storage. "/>
			<outline text="We'll do some diggin."/>
			<outline text="***Jeff solves the puzzle"/>

			<outline text="Netscape is the fastest growing startup in history. There's a lot of energy focused on them. In the trades they face off with Microsoft. In the back rooms, everyone wants to do a deal with Netscape, to be validated by them. People boast of their connection with Netscape, and in the next sentence complain how arrogant and inaccessible they are."/>
			<outline text="***If only"/>
			<outline text="In the old days we used to say &quot;If only Apple would...&quot;, now we substitute Netscape. But, if they met with everyone, did deals with everyone, they'd have no time to do their own software. And they would probably still enrage 95% of the people who want to do deals with them."/>
			<outline text="The developer song goes like this. Netscape is encircled by Microsoft. They're going to lose. I have exactly the technology they need to win. If only they would do a deal with me! But they don't return my calls. "/>
			<outline text="***Sucking up"/>
			<outline text="If a puppy sucks on a dry tit, it dies. If you depend on a deal with Netscape and you don't get it, your software dies. So we all have a choice, bet everything on a deal with Netscape, or find other ways to gain acceptance."/>
			<outline text="This is how I see it. They're doing the best they can at Netscape. They want to apply their energy to the success of their company. They don't see the world your way or my way, they see it their way, and that's OK. To some extent we get to define them, but they also have a say in how they're defined."/>
			<outline text="***Sucking sideways"/>
			<outline text="I'll keep making offers to Netscape. It can't hurt. Maybe at some time our interests and attention will align perfectly. I wouldn't want to miss the opportunity."/>
			<outline text="But in the meantime, instead of sucking up, I want to suck sideways. Make invitations to people who have the time to listen, and are likely to consider the offer. And, more important, I keep my door as open as I can to new ideas, and try not to say no before I've tried to say yes."/>
			<outline text="We're all on a rollercoaster of ups and downs, even the biggest most respected companies. Remember that, and focus on the persistent value -- the talents of the people, and the software they've already got running. Assume people are creative; if you let them, they'll entertain you. Just when you think it's over, something new happens, a relief pitcher comes in, and the game goes on."/>

			<outline text="At a meeting last week, a friend exclaimed &quot;They're worse than Apple!&quot; That, and a few conversations at the Netscape developer conference last week got me thinking about this stuff. I asked my friend &quot;Which Apple?&quot; I was making a sideways point."/>
			<outline text="Netscape is only three years old. Their culture developed quickly, they borrowed lots of ideas from previous Silicon Valley phenomena, some successful, others not. They need to be lead as much as we need them to lead. If we all have to do deals with Netscape to win, very few of us will be winners."/>

			<outline text="According Sun, Java is both a programming language and an operating system. 100 Percent Pure is their attempt to enforce the bond."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday Microsoft went on a press tour to roll out a new thing called J/Direct. They say that 100 Percent Pure is the road to developer bankruptcy. Java is just a programming language for making Windows apps. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;This is a trap,&quot; says Sun. &quot;It defeats the purpose of Java.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Yes, that's true. "/>
			<outline text="Could they have possibly not seen it coming?"/>
			<outline text="***A brief history"/>
			<outline text="Languages bound to operating systems tend to break apart. "/>
			<outline text="Unix had C, but now you can write in C for any OS. Pascal had the UCSD P-System. The Mac started life as a Pascal operating system, without UCSD compatibility, but eventually it could be programmed using any popular programming language, including C and soon Java."/>
			<outline text="Bottom line -- if an OS becomes popular, it gets every language. If a language gets popular, you can use it to make apps on any OS."/>
			<outline text="***The cross-platform story"/>
			<outline text="Java runs much better on Windows NT 4.0 than it does on a Mac. There goes the entire cross-platform story. We warned the Java people that this was a fatal flaw, over and over, when there was still time to fix the problem. There was a total disconnect -- they saw the Mac as a dead platform, but missed that its revival was central to their purpose. "/>
			<outline text="No doubt they plan to create another platform, other than the Mac, to be the platform they cross to, but to most developers that's irrelevant, unless they have lots of money coming in. Most Java developers are as poor as any other kind of developer. They're hungry, they want money, they need money, now, there's no time to wait."/>
			<outline text="And you don't have to be an ace historian to predict which base of software is going to be more interesting. Cash-fat developers create flat software because they have to spend more time in meetings pleasing stupid bosses than the leaner variety that want to ship working code and beat their competitors in the market."/>
			<outline text="***You need a cloud"/>
			<outline text="It's really about killer clouds, not killer apps."/>
			<outline text="The Mac gained traction not when PageMaker shipped, but when lines of software buyers started showing up at ComputerWare in Palo Alto. They were mixing up all kinds of neat gadgets and desk accessories, not just the big apps -- Excel and Word, PhotoShop, Suitcase, Eudora, WebSTAR and Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="Even the Apple II, a platform with a very short life, had more than VisiCalc to drive its popularity. Same with the character-based IBM PC that had Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, dBASE and Sidekick."/>
			<outline text="What's the killer app of Windows? I think there's a clue. No single app made Windows happen. That's the charm of Windows, a very old operating system that ages reasonably gracefully. "/>
			<outline text="So, even if one of the big-money Java developers produces something exciting, that isn't enough to make a platform. You need a cloud of killer apps, not just one, a new wave of fun and depth and style to get people excited. "/>

			<outline text="The first is from Rob Glaser, robg@prognet.com, the founder and CEO of Progressive Networks, the people who make RealAudio and RealPlayer. I first met Rob in 1985 or so, when I was making PC outliners and he was a marketing manager at Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="***Rob Glaser on Java"/>
			<outline text="Using the same product and trademark for both a platform and a language is a kiss of death for JavaSoft. Instead of 100 Percent Pure theology, they should make a real OS, allow people to write apps for it in multiple languages, and even allow people to write native code.  "/>
			<outline text="However, even if this were fixed, there would still be the problem that JavaSoft is 100 Percent Owned by a hardware company, which is another kiss of death for a platform. Remember IBM and Apple."/>
			<outline text="Too bad Netscape either doesn't care about being in the platform business or mistakenly thinks that you can be in the corporate IS platform business and not in the end user bottom-up platform business.  "/>
			<outline text="Too bad Apple is where it is."/>
			<outline text="Too bad there is only one platform company left standing."/>
			<outline text="***Where Apple Is"/>
			<outline text="About Apple, two things are happening this month with the Mac platform, one which will increase momentum for it as a developer platform, and the other can't help but undermine Apple's current direction."/>
			<outline text="The first is shipment of Mac OS 8, which is getting rave reviews from people who are using it. The file system is faster, having been rewritten in native PowerPC code, and the Finder is multi-threaded. The user interface got an overhaul, better more modern use of color and user preferences. People say it's solid. [See Rich Siegel's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/richSiegelMacOS8.html&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;.]"/>
			<outline text="The undermining influence is Connectix's Virtual PC, which is also getting rave reviews. For less than $200 you can run PC software on Macs. Connectix is known for solid implementations of low level system stuff; and they're a marketing machine. People say it's solid. "/>
			<outline text="An interesting irony, Windows NT may usurp Rhapsody as the high-end operating system for the classic Mac OS API. It's shipping for Mac hardware over a year before Rhapsody and it already has many thousands of apps and it's fully compatible with Mac using Connectix's software."/>
			<outline text="Certainly some users are waiting for Rhapsody. For others (we'll see how many) Virtual PC allows them to start learning and running Windows apps now. "/>
			<outline text="The next speaker is Craig Cline, ccline@sbforums.com, editorial director of Seybold Seminars, the people that do big publishing conferences and expensive newsletters for the print and web communication industries."/>
			<outline text="***Craig Cline on Java"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is just doing what they always do -- take a language,  tweak the hell out of it so it builds excellent Windows apps (or the best that can be developed for Windows with that language), and then puts it out there and says &quot;you choose, folks.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Given the number of Windows machines on corporate desktops this is bound to be a winning strategy, because the trend in companies is to consolidate onto one platform whenever possible, not shoot for diversity.  Macs are only grudgingly supported, and then usually only for creative service and marketing types."/>
			<outline text="When I first heard that Sun had licensed Java to Microsoft, I told (Marimba CEO) Kim Polese that it wouldn't be long before Microsoft was doing Java better than Sun, and would ultimately seek to coopt it entirely by offering its tools up as alternatives to the ABM offerings.  "/>
			<outline text="This they have done almost to the letter, with J/Direct being the logical &quot;check&quot; move.  Sun &amp; Company will have to play their cards perfectly now to keep this from becoming &quot;checkmate.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Rick Segal frames a question"/>
			<outline text="From Rick Segal, rsegal@microsoft.com, an exec at Microsoft:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;It wasn't clear in your J/Direct piece if you thought we were doing good or bad thing.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Bill Gates on Java"/>
			<outline text="I don't see J/Direct as good or bad, just inevitable. "/>
			<outline text="One correspondent said &quot;I saw this DaveNet piece coming a mile away.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Right on. Me too. Check out &quot;Bill Gates on Java&quot;, 4/5/97, where he said &quot;Most applications require operating system services whether it's a duplicate operating system on top of the main one or the primary OS on the machine.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="It's clear that, as Bill Gates parses it, Java is a programming language for making Windows apps. Why should he view it any differently?"/>
			<outline text="As Cline sees it, there's no way forward with the current JavaSoft strategy. I agree. To play their cards perfectly, they probably have to set Java completely free, otherwise checkmate is coming very soon."/>
			<outline text="Glaser sees Netscape heading for the hills, and I see it happening too. Center stage is being left to Microsoft, this is probably inevitable; now the question is who gets to thrive (or survive) in the wings?"/>
			<outline text="Gates's full comments are at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/04/BillGatesonJava.html "/>
			<outline text="***It all suggests..."/>
			<outline text="Why would Sun think that Microsoft wouldn't move to bind the Java language to the Windows APIs? I bet it has something to do with the license agreement. To understand what's really going on, we're going to have to see what Microsoft signed. Some people think the next step will be for Sun to file suit against Microsoft. At that time, for sure, we'll see what the agreement looks like."/>
			<outline text="***Tonight at the Fillmore"/>
			<outline text="If you're free and in San Francisco tonight, come to the Fillmore, 1805 Geary Blvd, 7PM, for the EFF benefit concert. Music by many friends! A very good cause -- your freedom."/>

At times, I connect to the mountain on four points."/>
			<outline text="The trail winds up the mountain. At lower elevations there's water and ferns, lots of trees and shade. Wild flowers are still in bloom. The creeks, raging torrents in rainy season, probably stopped running just a couple of weeks ago. As you go up, the trees thin, the trail turns into a dirt road that spirals the peak. And then, this time it was no surprise, the view of the valley opens. No surprise, but it's just as sudden. Whoooosh, you're in space. In front of you is thirty miles of air!"/>

			<outline text="My first reaction to the problem that Netscape 2.0 users were having with my home page was to require Netscape 3.0 or greater. In other words, if you want to read my page, you have to upgrade to a more current browser."/>
			<outline text="Then I saw an opportunity to learn how scalable content applies to websites. I spent the morning reprogramming the scripts that build the home page. If you want to have a look, check out &quot;user.websites.home&quot;. The source code is there, embedded in the fat page."/>
			<outline text="***How it works"/>
			<outline text="The script that builds the home page now adds comments that tell the filter script how to prepare a version of the page that displays well in Netscape 2.0. To see how this works, visit the home page and view source. You'll see "/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!-- notForNetscape2Start --&gt; and &amp;lt;!-- notForNetscape2End --&gt;"/>
			<outline text="in the text. "/>
			<outline text="A filter script, at user.websites.home.[&quot;#filters&quot;].finalfilter, runs when the page is finished building, copies the text and removes the parts that aren't part of the Netscape 2 page and writes the result out at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/defaultNetscape2.html"/>
			<outline text="Every time I add an item to the Scripting News page, the Netscape 2.0 version of the page is updated. So people who are using an older browser, or who prefer a simpler look, can visit that page for the latest news and commentary."/>
			<outline text="***Perspective"/>
			<outline text="I program the home page by entering text into an outline. The fancy home page is built automatically, as always, from the last ten days of outlines, stored in my database. The new thing -- there's now a simple version built automatically from the fancier version."/>
			<outline text="Enough users were left behind in the shift from Netscape 2.0 to 3.0, that by extrapolation, a lot of users are going to stay with the 3.0 browsers as the more adventurous people switch to 4.0. As a web developer I want to explore the new features, but after thinking about it, I realized I didn't want to leave anyone behind."/>

			<outline text="&quot;Yes!&quot; says Java. &quot;The geeks do matter.&quot; The geeks delight! Ahhh. Java *is* the Internet... It's bigger and more mysterious than HTML. &quot;Just wait,&quot; say the Java proponents. &quot;The killer app is just around the corner.&quot; "/>

			<outline text="Howard Fore, hofo@bellsouth.net, responds: &quot;Marketing.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Right on."/>
			<outline text="***Hype"/>
			<outline text="Java has been hyped, but it hasn't been marketed. Marketing is more than promotion, it's positioning, defining, and connecting. What are your strengths? What are your limits? What is your product used for? What *isn't* it used for?"/>
			<outline text="The Apple II had education, the Mac had publishing. Windows replaced the Mac on corporate desktops. Industrial databases run on Oracle. Netscape made the Internet colorful and easy to navigate. They all had stories you could understand while they were establishing their long-term positions."/>
			<outline text="Do an experiment... Stop a random person on the street and ask what Java is. It's a fair question since Java has become a household word. But does it own a position? Yeah I guess it does -- Java is the future, people say. A familiar position... Java is the future, in the same way HyperCard, Next, Taligent, Go, OpenDoc and General Magic were."/>
			<outline text="Java was skillfully latched onto the boom happening in the web, a time of great confusion in the software industry. It was a smart opportunistic tactic, but Java still doesn't have a strategy, a message, a position -- a niche it's developing that it can own as the hype dies down."/>
			<outline text="***Leaders"/>
			<outline text="In recent history, every platform that gained traction had an identifiable leader. Steve Jobs spoke for the Apple II and the Macintosh in the early years at Apple. Bill Gates speaks for Windows. Larry Ellison for Oracle. Marc Andreessen for Netscape. "/>

			<outline text="***Turtle graphics"/>
			<outline text="In 1979 I programmed in UCSD Pascal on an Apple II. It had a library of routines called Turtle Graphics. Imagine a turtle crawling around on your screen. It has a pen in its mouth. You can tell the turtle to put the pen down, then when the turtle moves it leaves a trail of ink behind it. Pull the pen up and the turtle moves invisibly."/>
			<outline text="It's a coordinate system, like the Cartesian coordinates you learned about in high school. Put the pen down. Tell the turtle to move to (0, 0), then to (0, 100), (100, 100), (100, 0) and back to (0, 0). You just drew a square."/>
			<outline text="We were doing this in the 70s. In the 90s it isn't rocket science. "/>
			<outline text="***Graphic systems"/>
			<outline text="After turtle graphics came &lt;a href=&quot;http://devworld.apple.com/dev/techsupport/insidemac/QuickDraw/QuickDraw-18.html&quot;&gt;QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt; which moved this idea into the operating system. This was the core of what made the Mac a graphic personal computer. It was built from the ground up with the assumption that an unseen turtle would display *all* the information users see. "/>
			<outline text="The basic operations are PenUp, PenDown, MoveTo and DrawString. QuickDraw is richer, but everything builds on and around these basic concepts."/>
			<outline text="Millions of programmers already know how to make the turtle do its thing. Anyone who writes HTML can easily master these concepts if (here's the catch) web browsers understood this kind of language. They don't. "/>
			<outline text="***Let's get on with it"/>
			<outline text="We want nice looking sites with moving text, that load quickly for all users, primarily for brochures and tasteful advertising. The text-gifs that clutter the net now are begging for a better solution. QuickDraw-like graphics with simple animation is what makes sense. I wrote about this in &quot;Macromedia Flash&quot;, 6/5/97."/>
			<outline text="Java is bull. We don't need to roll in a whole virtual machine just for turtle graphics. Microsoft and Netscape's browsers are lost trying to be multimedia players. Flash is what we need. I have an idea! Let's not wait for Microsoft and Netscape. Let's ask Macromedia to hook the Flash editor up to web content tools, let's ask the tool vendors to work with Macromedia, and let's get on with it."/>

They must obey a set of rules called The Constitution, which is interpreted by the only non-elected branch of government, the Supreme Court. They are appointed by the President and ratified by Congress, but after that they answer to no one, they can't be voted out of office, they don't stand for re-election."/>
			<outline text="The court's job is to stop the legislative and executive branches of government from violating the Constitution. Theoretically the court shouldn't be necessary because all government officials swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, but sometimes it doesn't work that way. "/>

			<outline text="I'd like to thank the U.S. Supreme Court for reaffirming our right to free speech no matter what medium we choose to communicate in. "/>
			<outline text="It was kind of a no-brainer, after all the first Amendment to the Constitution clearly prohibits Congress from establishing laws that abridge free speech. The CDA clearly did abridge free speech. There are so many lawyers in Washington -- they must have seen the problem. What was going on there? And what can we learn from this experience?"/>
			<outline text="***We wanted it"/>
			<outline text="I see one important lesson. Congress passed the CDA and Clinton signed it because we wanted them to. If we didn't want censorship, it wouldn't have happened. E pluribus unum."/>
			<outline text="We have representative government, we elect the president and the Congress. They belong to us, they reflect us. If we vote for someone else, in next election we become something else. They want to get re-elected, and we fear change, so they're constantly refining their positions to echo our complaints, thinking in four year intervals, saying and doing things that will get them re-elected."/>

			<outline text="You can't trust the politicians. A common belief. But what if we made trustworthiness an issue? Not just at a superficial level, but at a real level. If I had my way, human rights would be a top trust-me issue in every election. How did you vote on the CDA? I'd like my politicians to have substantial fear next time they're asked to vote to abridge free speech."/>
			<outline text="The web is a free medium. Could we use the web to revolutionize the political system in the United States? Technologically it's totally within our grasp. Could we somehow get our fellow citizens to care about freedom? That's the real challenge."/>

			<outline text="But there are unusual smells, like incense, that only come when dry hot dust gets wet. You never get those smells from northeastern summer rain, so they're new smells for me. The air is just full of these smells right now. I totally dig it."/>
			<outline text="***Unfinished work"/>
			<outline text="I've gotten flames from the set of pieces I did last week on Java, but there are new perspectives and new information, and after some gathering and thinking, I have some conclusions to offer. "/>
			<outline text="***Java is a brand"/>
			<outline text="I think the religious stuff, the McNealy speeches, are just a tactic. Create controversy for the reporters to write about. While Java is still hot in the press, develop and start running a new ad campaign that's stunning, the most creative software ads I've ever seen. "/>
			<outline text="Launch new ideas, Java-this and Java-that, and see which ones get real. Postpone any narrowing of focus until it's clear that something is working. In the meantime, the ads and the press continue to develop a brand identity."/>
			<outline text="One of the ingredients of a successful platform is its religious message. Apple had the great 1984 ad. Microsoft kissed the C prompt goodbye, forever. Java erases the limits. Great advertising helps a platform happen, and they're getting great at advertising at Sun."/>
			<outline text="***It's a work in progress"/>
			<outline text="In terms of delivered software that developers can target apps for, the only part of the Java system that's complete is the language -- the spec and the byte-code interpreter. Developer tools are moving rapidly. "/>
			<outline text="The press has trouble seeing the difference between planned software and delivered software. Confusion. Where's the line? What's really delivered? Sun, at the top level, doesn't want to address the question. At the lower levels, they want you to know that they're working as fast as they can, moving quickly, but it isn't finished yet."/>
			<outline text="***Server-side Java"/>
			<outline text="In terms of delivery, they say 1997 is the year of server-side Java, linking databases to the web using Java as an intermediary. We could focus on that, start developing the equivalent of CGI applications using Java. But this is already a mature area, there are lots of server-side options that don't involve Java. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, perhaps IBM, Oracle and Netscape have a say in what tools and environments large-site developers will use to deploy the next generation of client-server software. If so, they clearly are investing their reputations, money and development resources in Java, giving it appeal as a server-side option."/>
			<outline text="***Maintainable code"/>
			<outline text="If you pick an oddball language you risk being abandoned if the language vendor changes their tune. And it's harder to hire programmers to work on your software. As the Year 2000 Problem has shown, even COBOL programmers are marketable because COBOL was such a popular language thirty years ago. This generation's hot language creates the next generation's maintenence problem. "/>
			<outline text="Of course programmers know this, and there's a tendency to choose the oddball environments as a means of achieving job security. It's unfair to employers, but it happens anyway. Also programmers adopt new ways very slowly. Once you have a great library of solutions in one environment, who wants to spend several years moving it all to another environment? It's a painful process."/>
			<outline text="***A wild card"/>
			<outline text="Even so, Java has a good start at being the default language of the net generation, but it isn't the only choice. There's another language with a confusing name, JavaScript, that's delivering more power every month, but doing it more quietly. It's the wild card in all this. "/>
			<outline text="Two philosophies -- scripting and programming; both are headed to the same place-- the position occupied by HyperCard in 1980s. This time the card metaphor has critical mass. The key ingredients: more memory, faster processors, virtually ubiquitous net connections, and deeper software know-how."/>
			<outline text="***The arrogance of Java"/>
			<outline text="Part of the premise of Java is a sand-based head-bury -- this is a new world -- Microsoft and the Microsoft-generation don't get it. The arrogance of youth! It can be really dangerous. Here's the deal, if older people want to get it, they can. It's only when they stubbornly bury their heads in the sand that older people stay locked in the Older Ways."/>
			<outline text="I've been on the other side of this, as part of the personal computer generation in the early 80s, when I was in my mid 20s. I was working on Unix systems made by DEC when the PC stores opened. I saw their beauty (RAM-based access to the screen!) and switched immediately -- it was a better design and I understood the advantage."/>
			<outline text="The mainframe and mini guys called our computers toys. They were right. But they didn't understand how dangerous toys could be! We had fun with our Apple IIs, Commodore 64s and PCs. They weren't having as much fun maintaining those huge systems built in Fortran or COBOL. We used Pascal, C and assembler. Our software was popular in ways they never imagined software could be."/>
			<outline text="All my career I expected that someday connections between computers would be ubiquitous. When it finally happened, there was no way I was going to be on the sidelines. I made it my business to understand the protocols, traditions and limitations of the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="You can become a student and explorer at any age. If you count us older folks out this time, I think you'll be disappointed to find out that some of us really do get it and have the energy and ambition to create great software."/>
			<outline text="***Java is not a multimedia format"/>
			<outline text="I've been meeting more user interface designers in the last few months, and I hear some distaste for Java from them, but I think it's based on a misunderstanding. "/>
			<outline text="Java is a programming language with a minimal runtime environment that can do some drawing and sound, but it is not itself a multimedia format. You could implement a PostScript interpreter in Java, so it could become a display format. You could build a Director or Flash-like runtime in Java, so it could become a multimedia format; or a RealAudio implementation in Java could make it handle streaming audio. But Java itself is no more a multimedia format than C or C++ is."/>
			<outline text="There will probably be dozens of Java-implemented multimedia formats, and they will mostly be rehashes of what's already available available in C. The power of standards will win out over euphoria. Java software will have to outperform the original implementations in some meaningful way. "/>
			<outline text="In multimedia, where performance is the central issue, I don't believe the cross-platform pitch has any value. The format interpreters have to be done in highly optimized native code."/>
			<outline text="Conclusion: Non-Java tools for multimedia are far more mature than those available for Java. The design people are saying &quot;Get back to me when there's a reason for me to use this stuff.&quot; At least that's what I'm hearing."/>
			<outline text="***Java competes with Windows"/>
			<outline text="If you want to understand why Microsoft sings a different song than Sun re Java, understand that because Sun is selling Java as a broad brand-name, and Windows is the leading broad brand-name, Microsoft is simply defending its position with a flanking move."/>
			<outline text="There's nothing controversial or unpredictable about this. They got the clue that Apple failed to get in 1990 when Microsoft did to Apple what Sun is now trying to do to Microsoft. Apple could have flanked Microsoft by producing cheap low-margin Mac hardware to replace the 386s that Microsoft was wanting to replace. It would have worked then, and it will work now. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft noticed that Java needs an OS. They already have one, Sun does not. They connect Java to Windows at a deep intimate level. It'll take a generation for Java to catch up, unless there's a silver bullet, something that a new OS can do that the &quot;hairball&quot; OS, Windows, can't."/>

Philippe Kahn and Mitch Kapor were saying that object orientation is the secret weapon that will defeat Microsoft. On stage at Esther's, Gates says &quot;I don't get it!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I cheered from the back of the room. But nowadays Gates has learned that when the industry goes insane, why buck the trend? He goes right along. If you want to be crazy, Bill can be even crazier! He proved it with pen-based computing, web browsers (where there was substance coinciding with the hype) and he's doing it again with Java."/>
			<outline text="***What is Java?"/>
			<outline text="OK, now some conclusions... As of the summer of 1997 -- What is Java?"/>
			<outline text="Foremost, Java is a brand-name owned by Sun Microsystems. I expect more Sun products to be grouped under the Java brand."/>
			<outline text="Enough people are learning Java the programming language to give it critical mass. As a higher-level cross-platform OS and a development environment, Java is still mostly unspecified and undeployed. "/>
			<outline text="Connecting the web to corporate databases is something you can do with Java today. In the future, Java may have user interfaces that make it an attractive option for client-side software."/>
			<outline text="Its cross-platform story is weak, unless a new hot Java-based platform comes along. Some people think the NetPC or beepers running Java applets will be the other platform, few people think it's the Mac. It may be that Windows can't scale down to the beeper level, but if a market happens, you can be sure Microsoft will be there with a competitive offering, and it will be called Windows, even if it is not."/>
			<outline text="Drinking the Kool Aid doesn't work anymore. Nichemanship is a good idea, watching for the real opportunity that Microsoft can't exploit. Zig when they have to zag to establish a defensible position."/>
			<outline text="George Burns, the great philosopher and a man who played God in the movies said &quot;Honesty is the best policy -- if you can fake that you've got it made.&quot; That's what Sun is doing, making Java look like an open alternative to Microsoft, when it's actually building value in a brand name that can be used to cover any kind of software or hardware. "/>
			<outline text="Their options remain open. Sun has the opportunity to carve a niche, but they have to decide what it is. "/>
			<outline text="And no change, it's still Microsoft's game to lose."/>

			<outline text="In May I wrote a DaveNet piece on Wired's NewBot search engine. The DaveNet piece was also called NewBot (hope this isn't too confusing)."/>
			<outline text="http://www.newbot.com/ "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/05/NewBot.html "/>
			<outline text="***I was waiting for this"/>
			<outline text="NewBot is a search engine that indexes over 100 news oriented websites on an hourly basis. It's an essential tool for a news oriented web writer. Often I'm visiting all the hot sites looking for various spins on stories as they roll out. I expect this to happen more and more, competing commentaries rushing to get on the web, pushing lead times down to their realistic minimum. The web reinvents journalism, and with some help from tools like NewBot, we get there sooooner."/>
			<outline text="Unfortunately NewBot came with a surprise. It only worked on Windows and required Internet Explorer. I found out later that this is because Microsoft partially funded the development of NewBot. I complained to the Wired people. The impact of NewBot isn't being felt because of its narrow compatibility. "/>
			<outline text="I want NewBot to have a straight HTML interface, like InfoSeek and Excite, the two search engines I use the most these days. "/>
			<outline text="***In the meantime"/>
			<outline text="Last week I successfully installed the NewBot software on my PC. It's a nice Visual Basic application. Colorful, fast, easy to use. I started using it to track stories. I was pleased with the whole experience, at first, but for some reason when I re-launched the NewBot app, the disk grinds for about a minute and no window opens. I've tried re-downloading and re-installing the software, to no avail."/>
			<outline text="The fun lasted about three days, I liked it a lot, but now I am without a just-in-time search engine again."/>
			<outline text="***Lost in ActiveX"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is funding lots of web development these days, splitting the bill with big publishing companies like Wired and Ziff-Davis. This guarantees some content for the new Internet Explorer 4.0 which is still in beta. It also keeps things like NewBot from opening up new growth on the web."/>
			<outline text="Personally, I think Wired is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. How much money is Microsoft paying them? Could it possibly be worth it? They have THE hot web idea of 1997, and it's lost in a mess of ActiveX."/>
			<outline text="***Two grueling weeks"/>
			<outline text="I just spent two weeks upgrading the &quot;Scripting News&quot; home page, negotiating bugs and incompatibilities between the two leading web browsers, Netscape Navigator 3.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. "/>
			<outline text="I finally arrived at a decent compromise that doesn't depend on GIFs for the user interface, has some color and style, doesn't crash Netscape or make it look silly, and can go somewhere. It was tough getting Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers to agree, but finally they do."/>
			<outline text="A surprise at first, I also had to make my page look good for Netscape 2.0. A lot of browser users haven't upgraded to the 3.0 level, even people reading a geekish site like Scripting News. Makes me wonder how long we'll be supporting the 3.0 level browsers."/>
			<outline text="***A TCP interface"/>
			<outline text="Back to just-in-time search engines..."/>
			<outline text="When Wired lets their new search engine talk to users thru HTML they will have a super hit. I wish they wouldn't wait. Or I wish one of their competitors would see the advantage in striking first."/>
			<outline text="I have my own ideas of what would make a great search engine interface. Now that Wired is playing around with this, I want to play too. I'd like to use an outliner and database for my searching. I'm sure others would invent other interesting interfaces."/>
			<outline text="Since only NewBot has this kind of server, it would be great if they propose a standard TCP-based interface for accessing the search engine so I can write desktop applications that interface to it. Go ahead and include ads in the TCP interface. Only promote clients that display the ads. "/>
			<outline text="When other just-in-time search engines show up we can ask them to be NewBot-compatible."/>

			<outline text="http://www.metaverse.com/aboutus/aboutadam.html "/>
			<outline text="He was nineteen when he was recruited by MTV. He quickly became a celebrity. MTV was as it appeared, 100-percent commercial. Stars have big egos and big power. Michael Jackson wanted to be known as the King of Pop, so there was a rule at MTV that when you mentioned his name, the tagline had to follow. "/>
			<outline text="I dig music. As with search engines, I care little about the money, a few ads are OK, unless they interfere with the human connection by permeating the stuff that's not supposed to be commercial."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft's money"/>
			<outline text="The software business is even more commercial than the music business. In this world we worship corporations, the CEOs and their bankrolls. The names of the people who create the software aren't considered important. "/>
			<outline text="Getting money from Microsoft is the way of the software world. In my email exchange with Louis yesterday I didn't make this point very well. Microsoft has the cash, and they know how to use it. Sometimes their purpose appears to be to delay new technology so it can happen sooner on their platform. "/>
			<outline text="In the tradition of the software business there's absolutely nothing unethical about receiving money from Microsoft. I think that's where Louis and I disconnected. I considered it a relevant fact, but it was not a challenge to Wired's integrity. Newbot is software, it's not in the same world as Wired's editorial product. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has $9 billion in cash and keeps generating more. Yesterday the rumor that Microsoft is buying CBS. That should be a wake-up call to everyone who cares about commercialism and the media. The ways of the software business added to the power of television. In the NPR report they called Microsoft &quot;the media company.&quot; I shivered when I heard that."/>

			<outline text="In &quot;Bill Gates's Money&quot;, 7/3/97, I asked why he is so rich. Gates's money is such a big entity, there's so much of it, and it's so powerful. An ingenuous argument comes back from Microsoft public relations. Gates doesn't have that much money. He couldn't sell his Microsoft stock, so it's just a paper fortune. He makes just $450K per year for being the CEO of Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="But he can invest a billion dollars in a cable company, buy WebTV for over $400 million. Bill Gates and Microsoft's money. It's a silly distinction. They're in the same body.

			<outline text="***Ken Olson"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Bill Gates vs The Internet&quot;, 10/18/94, I asked if Bill Gates would be the Ken Olson of our era. Olson is the founder of DEC, the Microsoft of the 1970s. Olson didn't catch the transition to the microcomputer and now DEC is totally marginalized, having exhausted its last strategic advantage. "/>
			<outline text="The only lesson DEC taught us recently is that momentum is a powerful force. It takes a long time for a company of DEC's size, with all those users, to die. DEC got a second chance after missing the transition to the micro, but they must have lacked the courage to bet the company. Their spiral is close to complete."/>

			<outline text="It didn't turn out that way. No, Bill Gates is not the next Ken Olson. He totally made the transition. "/>
			<outline text="Marvel, Microsoft's answer to CompuServe, Gates's eWorld, is a dim memory. He cut his losses, zigged into the new market while his old competitors stayed where they were. The standards bodies were no contest. Microsoft is on every committee and their programmers move quickly. "/>
			<outline text="He's in the driver's seat again. It may be possible for new standards to come out of left field, but you have to always be thinking of Bill Gates as you move. Eventually he's going to look at what you're doing and if your strategy undermines his power, they'll build the standard right around you."/>

			<outline text="It's been a couple of months since I wrote about Apple. It's been a problem for me, because I have an opinion on their strategy. "/>
			<outline text="When I last wrote about them I got messages from Apple people practically begging me not to do it again. "/>
			<outline text="I fall for this kind of stuff, but enough time has passed, there are more lessons to learn, it's time to write about Apple again."/>
			<outline text="***When the parade has passed you by"/>
			<outline text="Last year, like DEC in the early 80s, Apple had lost the leading position in its own market. Developers weren't following anymore, but users were still buying. Cash was coming in from hardware sales, but investment dollars weren't flowing into the market. "/>
			<outline text="My belief: the best approach in such situtations is to reduce your own investment, no new initiatives are going to work when the developers aren't investing alongside you. Keep the users happy with hardware and small performance related software upgrades, and open your eyes and ears, open them wide, and try to catch wind of new developments that look promising. "/>
			<outline text="Put down lots of small bets, not on your own people, you can't afford internal adventures on a big company payroll, it's too expensive, and a big company environment is the wrong place for them. Bet on small startups. "/>
			<outline text="The key here is to spread the cash around, hoping that one of the new companies will provide you a chance to build a new skyscraper using their technology. You have no choice but to wait! The next direction can't come from within. "/>
			<outline text="Meanwhile, the board wants new initiatives, new user experiences, new theories. You have to tell them no. Hunker down and wait. It's a good strategy, because there will always be something new to try out in the high tech business. "/>
			<outline text="Some of the new ideas work, most don't. You want to be strong for the long-term. Every time the pendulum swings, you want to have the option to go for the ride."/>
			<outline text="***The sure road to bankruptcy"/>
			<outline text="The key mistake Apple made was betting exclusively on its own people for new technology directions. Huge money was spent on researchers who were so inwardly directed they couldn't even see the worldwide web when it happened. "/>
			<outline text="Eventually Apple's board lost faith in these people, good move, but they brought in more people in to bet on. The problem with the Next folks was that they had already lost when Apple bought them. Even an accountant could see this. A few interviews with developers would have provided certainty. Next was a bad bet for Apple's shareholders."/>
			<outline text="It's a shame, $400 million could have capitalized 100 startup software companies. Winners, several of them would have emerged by now. They'd have an exciting product to sell, and many more on the way. But they were unwilling to open their eyes and look outside for new direction."/>
			<outline text="Amelio was the wrong choice to lead Apple. He had no grounding in the software business. He delayed in cutting losses in failed technologies. These were minor gaffes compared to the decision to bail out Next's creditors and assume their already bankrupt strategy. Apple shareholders are going to pay dearly for this decision. It's the sure road to bankruptcy for Apple. "/>
			<outline text="***I don't trust Jobs"/>
			<outline text="Once you're dug in on a platform, it's so painful to switch. This is the lesson of computers. If you create using one, it really becomes personal. This is why Apple could spin in its spiral for a decade and still sell millions of computers a year."/>
			<outline text="In December 1996, Apple signaled the death of the Macintosh. By February the last doubt was gone. Apple did the unthinkable thing, they quit. &quot;Rhapsody is what users want,&quot; they said. I didn't think so. "/>
			<outline text="I tried to find some way it would make sense to produce a Rhapsody product. But I already had decided not to invest in software for Rhapsody back when it was NextStep. I had experience with Steve Jobs when he was in charge of Apple in the 80s. I took another look. Had anything changed? No. I saw a software developer prison being created. &quot;Sign here,&quot; they said. I said no the first time and the second time too."/>
			<outline text="Amelio and Apple's board didn't ask developers what they thought of Steve Jobs before they spent their last money buying him out. If they had asked me, I would have said not to do it. I don't trust Jobs."/>
			<outline text="***Does he think we're stupid?"/>
			<outline text="Jobs says he's just an advisor to Gil. Does he think we're stupid? Amelio is confused, out of breath, over his head, gears stripped, without grounding. He has no power within Apple."/>
			<outline text="Jobs presents himself as the expert in the software business. He says &quot;Java Java Java&quot; but Java is not a product or an OS or a platform, it's just a brand. His message to remaining Mac developers: &quot;Port!&quot; and the developers say &quot;OK!&quot; But the ports are happening to Win32, not Rhapsody."/>
			<outline text="Jobs was the wrong person to choose to turn around Apple because that isn't what he wants. He wants to turn around Next. And he's willing to lose Apple to do it. Jobs calls the shots at Apple, Amelio has no power. Eventually I expect a bankruptcy and a shoulder shrug from Jobs as he leaves. &quot;I tried,&quot; he'll say."/>
			<outline text="***A creditors committee"/>
			<outline text="The party is almost over, all the loans have been taken, all the cash has been spent. Sales of Rhapsody are $0. The Mac continues to sell, but in greatly reduced numbers. Distribution is walking away. They're losing the education market, the multimedia developer market, their mainstays. "/>
			<outline text="A creditors committee will have a better chance of finding a profitable business at the core of Apple. The great adventures will be over, finally. There are still people who would pay a few thousand dollars for a faster bigger Mac. There's the core of the business. "/>
			<outline text="It'll be a much smaller business than Apple was a few years ago, but there's got to be profit in there; at least enough money to pay off the creditors."/>
			<outline text="***The old man and the skyscraper"/>
			<outline text="On Monday, in &quot;The Ken Olson Question&quot;, I told the story of an old man and a bank. A skyscraper is being built around his house, but the man holds on, wanting to die in the house he raised his kids in. "/>
			<outline text="It's a metaphor. Apple is the bank -- twenty years later. While their technology aged, they continued to pour money into a system that didn't work, hoping to recreate the magic, thru pure genius and financial power, the energy that that built the skyscraper so many years ago."/>
			<outline text="But they missed the point, it wasn't genius that created the skyscraper in the first place. The Apple II was the result of good engineering, somewhat, and good hype, somewhat; but it was mostly made of great timing. If they had started Apple two years earlier or later it wouldn't have worked. Same with the Mac. It needed the Apple II cash cow to have a chance. It also needed IBM to fail to understand how much memory people needed. Timing is everything."/>
			<outline text="Genius doesn't make your economics go boom. What does? Timing, luck, and changes in technological directions that are missed by your competitors. Once you become a big company, it's a struggle to look outside, but in the technology business you must, or you will miss the change when it comes. "/>
			<outline text="***Platforms die slowly"/>
			<outline text="Last year Apple wasn't a leader, yet they played the game as if they were.  People said the net is the computer and they were right. And the platform is the developers. When you're a platform vendor with few developers, you don't have much of a platform. But it takes a long time for platforms to die because it's so difficult for users to switch."/>
			<outline text="I've said it so many times, Apple's economics are totally out of whack. After all the losses, over all these quarters, could anyone doubt this? And nothing has changed. They're still playing adventure, spending huge amounts of money to get deeper into a platform proposition that doesn't work. Windows won't lay down and die. Microsoft will not miss the turn in the road. "/>
			<outline text="Soon the bubble will burst, it can't go on forever."/>
			<outline text="***Like the Okies in the thirties"/>
			<outline text="We're going to Windows, not Rhapsody. It's so hard to switch. I want a safe place to build my little tree house. We've looked back several times, and wondered what was going on in our old home. But like the Okies in the thirties, there's no place for us there. So we look over the horizon and hope for the best!"/>

			<outline text="A few wrap-ups on the news and opinions flowing thru DaveNet yesterday."/>
			<outline text="***A challenge"/>
			<outline text="A respectful challenge comes from Ryan Tate. He says:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;If you truly had 'early knowledge' and not just early rumors, don't you think other developers would have wanted a heads-up? I mean, what's DaveNet all about? What's Scripting News all about? You had the news and you sat on it. Why should anyone turn to scripting.com when you just do day-after spinmeistering?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;I recognize that it is your call to say or not say whatever you want. but as a loyal DaveNet reader for the last two years, I feel more than a little let down. Community is about the right mix of openness and discretion, it is my view that in this case your community could have used a lot more openness.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Mr. Tate has a personal website at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ryantate/ "/>
			<outline text="***Two crazy days"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday and the day before were overwhelming. Everything happened so quickly. It was hard to keep up with events as they were happening. In balance I'm satisfied with the result. But I think it makes sense to tell how it happened."/>
			<outline text="On Tuesday I spoke with a not-for-attribution source that confirmed the rumor that Amelio had resigned. I called a friend at the San Jose Mercury-News, Jodi Mardesich, and filled her in. I did not say who my source was. I asked for advice."/>
			<outline text="We decided to team up. I called my friends. The Mercury reporters called their sources. If they had gotten confirmation I would have reported Amelio's resignation as a fact. But we didn't get confirmation. That's where we were on Wednesday morning."/>
			<outline text="I had been working on &quot;The Sure Road to Bankruptcy&quot; for about a month. It didn't depend on Amelio's resignation. I had not run the piece before because Apple was quieting down as a news story. I have regrets about this as I indicated in the lead to Wednesday's piece."/>
			<outline text="We weren't sure when or if the announcement would come from Apple, so when I was finished with the opinion piece I released it. I would have stood behind yesterday's piece either way, whether or not the story proved true, whether or not it broke this week or next, or never. As it turned out my piece shipped about two hours before the announcement came from Apple."/>
			<outline text="Mr. Tate and others questioned my decision to hold the news story, but the Mercury had the same information I did, and they didn't run the story until the Apple press release ran. "/>
			<outline text="Hey I'm glad I called Jodi, it was a great collaboration. I learned a lot from the experience; I'd do it again, anytime. And next time a news story breaks this quickly, I hope we do even better."/>
			<outline text="***Newstracker"/>
			<outline text="This was the first time a major story broke on the web that I had a &quot;just in time&quot; search engine to help me follow other writer's work. I wrote about this in  &quot;Microsoft's Money&quot;, 7/2/97, and in previous pieces. "/>
			<outline text="I used Excite's NewsTracker to follow the Amelio story. The NewsTracker folks say they index the sites four times a day, but it appears to happen more slowly. By mid-morning today, the new stories were appearing in their database. I wish their database could catch the stories more quickly. "/>
			<outline text="Even so, it's a uniquely valuable service for people who want to follow stories as they appear on the web. Here's an absolutely unsolicited testimonial. Any competitive reporter, editor or analyst covering a breaking story is totally missing out if they're not using Newstracker."/>
			<outline text="http://nt.excite.com/ "/>
			<outline text="***Crashes and Caches"/>
			<outline text="I've been consistent over the years in asking Apple to focus on fixing bugs in the Mac OS. When they explain why Rhapsody is needed, they talk about protecting the operating system from crashing apps. Perhaps a simpler approach would work better for most Mac users? "/>
			<outline text="Talking with a reporter friend this morning who is a Mac user, I realized that many people who use Macs don't know about MacsBug, a common programmer's tool that can make application crashes much less painful and help you save data before restarting the system. "/>
			<outline text="Also, I recently learned how to make my system boot more quickly, with a simple reconfiguration of (get this) my web browser. It turns out that the larger your browser cache, the longer your machine takes to start up."/>
			<outline text="Both these problems could be solved more elegantly and expensively, but fixes are readily available and many Mac users don't know about them. Details are at:"/>

			<outline text="***Taking the weekend off"/>
			<outline text="There may be more news over the weekend, but we won't have it at Scripting News. I'm taking a class over the weekend, so on Monday we'll resume the normal (nutty!) schedule. We're expecting some new software releases next week. Stay tuned and..."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;A Microsoft/Apple Partnership?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/11/97; 11:44:52 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here's a fascinating email from Loren Lovhaug, llovhaug@mpr.org, from Minnesota Public Radio, http://www.mpr.org/, in response to &quot;The Sure Road to Bankruptcy&quot;, 7/9/97."/>
			<outline text="***Loren Lovhaug on Apple"/>
			<outline text="Apple has effectively used the counter-culture theme to market the Macintosh as the alternative platform for years, first as an alternative to IBM and then later as an alternative to Microsoft.  "/>
			<outline text="Part of the problem with the approach is that it casts them into second place status.  I don't think you can ever be successful playing for second place, especially when you are playing in what is effectively a two player game."/>
			<outline text="Apple and the Mac faithful need to adjust the way they view reality.  The key to Apple's survival is to steal a page from the Microsoft playbook, and to use the same &quot;Embrace &amp; Extend&quot; tactics that Microsoft has so masterfully used with everything from GUIs, database technologies (both desktop and server), as well as the web and Java."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft does not need to be the enemy.  Microsoft is only the enemy if you choose to make it the foe as either a marketing strategy or because of a religious conviction.  It is fun to have passion about the Mac or Apple, but that passion should not blind you to the fact that 90% or more of the microcomputers in use today are running a Microsoft operating environment.  Leveraging that fact rather than fighting against it is the key to Apple's survival."/>
			<outline text="I believe Apple should enter into a partnership with Microsoft to extend Windows NT for Apple's customers and Apple's needs.  Specifically I would advocate Apple acquiring primary responsibility for the now discontinued PowerPC version of Windows NT.  "/>
			<outline text="Apple then could work to put an improved Macintosh face (a Finder-like shell plus other extensions) on NT while maintaining compatibility with existing and future NT applications. Microsoft would benefit from additional leverage against Intel, just as Digital provides with the Alpha version of NT. "/>
			<outline text="Such an effort could be useful for Microsoft against the Sun/Oracle net computer Unix crowd.  Apple would then focus on providing a higher degree of integration, elegance, and performance to their in-house PowerPC based hardware in concert with the Apple NT extensions so that Apple boxes can be a higher end, value-added way to run NT.  This might even allow Apple to get back the margins they used to enjoy with the Mac in the late 1980s.  "/>
			<outline text="Such an effort would also help ISVs in that they would only have to target only the Win32 API for low level functions, but could do special things with the Apple NT Extensions."/>
			<outline text="***My response"/>
			<outline text="Thank you! I think you have an incredibly good idea here."/>
			<outline text="A version of NT that's customized to make sense to a Mac user would be very welcome. I've tried and tried to make NT look and look and work like a Mac. I put the icons down the left edge of the screen. I want my Cmd-key! I want selection to act like a Mac. There are so many braincell burners going from Mac to NT. I curse that Apple lawsuit that made Microsoft deviate from the look and feel of the Mac. Apple used their users! What a trip."/>
			<outline text="It's really nice the way Microsoft made NT be an Appleshare-compatible file server. It would be nice if Macs could return the favor. It would help us cross-platform users better leverage the things that Macs do better than NT machines. Another interesting idea would be to make it so that AppleScript and Frontier could drive DCOM-based apps over the LAN. "/>
			<outline text="I've said what you've said several times in the past. I think no one is served by the faceoff. It's obsolete. Vestigial. The people who flame religiously over platform preferences have the loudest and most offensive voices. A choice of computer is not a political statement. They are tools and instruments, like a hammer or a violin. What gets created with them is what's important. Too much attention is focused on the tool, not enough on the users and their creativity."/>
			<outline text="It's time to ignore the zealots, let them be, and focus on taking care of our own needs. A smooth transition is what we need and a solid platform for future development. If Apple wants to make sense to Mac users they must embrace the transition. I know that current Apple management may not understand the transition, so be it. They could help us, and keep some of the loyalty of their users intact."/>
			<outline text="The Mac doesn't have the high ground now. Apple is a mess, and people who use Macs pay the price. There's a lot of focus on how the Apple management nightmare has affected the people who work there. There isn't enough focus on serving the needs of the people who use Apple's products."/>
			<outline text="***A correction and another point of view"/>
			<outline text="MacsBug is an abbreviated form of Motorola Advanced Computer Systems Debugger, not Macintosh System Debugger."/>
			<outline text="Current and former researchers at Apple say that they &quot;got&quot; the net in the late 80s and early 90s, and pleaded with Apple management to invest, but were ignored. One ex-Apple researcher says they anticipated the Web at Apple in the early 90s. "/>

			<outline text="One night, two parties. You have to choose. You never know what's waiting for you! Which way to go? Either way you go, life will be different. "/>
			<outline text="***Choices"/>
			<outline text="Life is totally about choice. &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.worldonline.nl/~dalmeier/bonnie.htm&quot;&gt;Bonnie Raitt&lt;/a&gt; sings &quot;I'm going to stay with this man until a better one comes along.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.igc.apc.org/afb/helen.html&gt;Hellen Keller&lt;/a&gt; said that security is the great illusion, there is no such thing. "/>
			<outline text="Embrace life and its choices. Accept insecurity. We're all going to die. The day will come, the door will open and you'll have to jump out of the plane. If you take the jump before you die you can have fun while you're still alive."/>
			<outline text="***Apple"/>
			<outline text="People ask who would make a good choice to run Apple. Someone with a soul and a personality and a friendly nature. Someone whose handshake means something. A person with passion for products and people and a businessperson who understands that the customer is always right. "/>
			<outline text="***A confused CEO"/>
			<outline text="Thanks to Jobs and Amelio the Mac OS has been buried in a confusing maze of blue, yellow and green boxes. Does anyone blame Mac users for being confused? "/>
			<outline text="A new CEO. First day on the job. &quot;What's the OS situation?&quot; We have a dual-OS strategy! Hmmm. &quot;Wouldn't it be simpler if we had just one OS?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="This reminds me of a story from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0452258618/6898-4432223-308275&quot;&gt;Ries &amp; Trout&lt;/a&gt;. A drinker walks into a bar. &quot;Give me a Johnny Walker,&quot; he says. Red or Black? &quot;The hell with that, give me a Chivas.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Coors and Coors Light. Volkswagen Dasher, Golf, Rabbit and Jetta. Yellow boxes, blue boxes, green boxes. If the new CEO has any marketing sense, he or she is going to see that the market is hopelessly confused. "/>
			<outline text="Want bigger sales? Want to move forward? Clear up the mess."/>
			<outline text="***Steve Jobs"/>
			<outline text="I think Steve Jobs understands that a choice is coming. It's the only logical way to proceed. One OS or two? Which one to toss and which one to keep? "/>
			<outline text="Jobs is smart. He knows a choice is coming. He wants to save the day, drama is needed and the Mac has to die. He's the semi-visible hand pulling the strings at Apple. David versus Bill Gates playing Goliath. Lee Iacocca versus Japan. Ross Perot versus the Iranians. Steve Jobs was always right. Next really is next. "/>
			<outline text="Why should I care?"/>
			<outline text="***Jesse Berst"/>
			<outline text="Jesse Berst of Anchor Desk incorrectly stated that &quot;The Sure Road to Bankruptcy&quot; contained a plan to save Apple. I'd appreciate more careful characterization. I said it would have been smart for Apple to have spent $400 million investing in developers instead of paying off Next's debt. That was history, not a recommendation."/>
			<outline text="The money is gone, unless Apple has a deep reserve of cash that's usable (I don't think they do). I was looking back at what could have been. Now there's no time for new investments to incubate, even if Apple had the cash. "/>
			<outline text="***Dumping an OS"/>
			<outline text="It's inevitable Apple will choose one OS and dump the other."/>
			<outline text="It's just as inevitable as the demise of OpenDoc was last year. They couldn't afford to keep all those researchers on the payroll. Focus was required. "/>
			<outline text="This summer, if they're serious about the Mac OS they have to devote all their attention to it. Same with Rhapsody. There's the problem. This is a company in dire trouble. In such situations focus is essential. Split attention is a disaster. Cutting losses is the only way to go. You have to make a lot of choices. Big ones."/>
			<outline text="***Being kind to the Mac"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Being Kind to the Mac&quot; 2/20/97 I said &quot;The wrong people own the Mac. They're going to kill it to try to save the company. There's a disconnect between the public story and the business plan they're creating. It's out of synch with the interests of Mac users and anyone who wants a real choice other than Windows.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Instead, a new [company], 250 people, could own the Mac OS and license it to Apple and the growing community of clone vendors. Engineers and webmasters, keeping the system current, fixing bugs, improving performance. Distribution of add-ons thru the net. Connections with the developer community, Netscape, Be, Apple and Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Such a company, properly managed and developed, could have a high market capitalization, and could quickly do a solid IPO. There's a business here -- it can't support a $9 billion company, but it could do $250 million in its first year and grow from there.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/02/BeingKindtotheMac.html "/>
			<outline text="You know what? I think the new 250-person company would have a higher market cap than today's Apple. "/>
			<outline text="***Avi and his team"/>
			<outline text="I have respect for Avi Tevanian and his team. They deserve a chance to focus on Rhapsody. We need to split up. Avi, go for it! If you're kind to the Mac now, I think that kindness will come back to you later. "/>
			<outline text="The good Mac people are all outside, at Netscape, Be, Power Computing, Connectix, Metrowerks, and Microsoft. Give us the Mac, let it go. "/>
			<outline text="Good luck with Rhapsody. Let everyone have fun and let the Apple shareholders have a good ride."/>
			<outline text="***An Asian government"/>
			<outline text="In April of this year, while Larry Ellison was teasing us with his idea of buying Apple, an Asian government was also interested. I met with a representative to talk about their idea. "/>
			<outline text="Development, marketing and support in the U.S. Back in the home country factories turn out cheap and reliable systems. A big web server farm and Dell-like warehouse in the midwest and overnight delivery. Cheap reliable Macs with steady reliable software delivered overnight. "/>
			<outline text="I thought it was a good idea. They asked me to write a business plan for the software arm of the new Apple. I wrote one..."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/04/CanAppleSurvive.html "/>
			<outline text="***Let the users choose"/>
			<outline text="Please read &quot;Being Kind to the Mac&quot; and &quot;Can Apple Survive?&quot; Inbetween these two pieces is my current recommendation. In April keeping Apple whole was my call. Now, in July I want a split. It's inevitable. If it doesn't happen now, it'll happen later. "/>
			<outline text="Mac and Rhapsody are two different directions, two independent companies that cooperate but don't coordinate. Metrowerks provides the glue. Rhapsody can have the Apple name and Apple brand. Mac gets a fresh start. If Rhapsody truly is superior and compatible the Mac may wither (it won't). Users need insurance in case Rhapsody is the next OpenDoc. Microsoft is providing insurance. We want the Mac OS to be in the insurance business too."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/17/97; 6:10:53 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="From an a man named Carl, carl@macitools.symantec.com, someone who works at Symantec, who didn't say what his last name is:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;I noticed that you corrected [site name deleted] on some time issues, but it seems like you don't disagree with the general point of the article which is that you are a petty and bitter man that unjustly screams as much negativity towards Apple as possible because they did not buy your software.  "/>
			<outline text="&quot;You seem to be presenting yourself as an Apple lover, when in reality you are an Apple hater, and have been for years, because of a personal issue.  You try to hurt not only the Apple company but also, indirectly the entire Mac community even though most or all of the people that personally hurt you no longer even work for Apple.  "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Speaking as a person in the Mac community, I find this to be extremely offensive.  I love the Mac and I am making my career in the Mac right now, so your innaccurate, wild, baseless, personal hate towards Apple is an indirect attack on me and my job.  "/>
			<outline text="&quot;You are not alone, of course.  There are thousands if not millions that are spreading half truths or even lies about the Mac, but I must tell you that I am a person (one of millions) that is being hurt by your hate.  Personally, I would like it if you just went back to building good software and control your emotions and your hate.  You also are one of the victims of your hate."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Bitterness will eat your soul alive Dave.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***I thought long and hard"/>
			<outline text="I thought a lot before deciding to share this. This is fairly typical of the email I've been receiving in huge volume over the last few days. There's an organized campaign to send me this kind of email. For some reason the Mac attracts this kind of energy. I don't know this man named Carl, and I believe he doesn't know me. "/>
			<outline text="A couple of weeks ago I had lunch with Stewart Alsop, venture capitalist and columnist at Fortune. He wrote a column about Steve Jobs's deal with Apple early this year. I agreed with Alsop's point of view. Steve Jobs raped Apple. He acted irresponsibly. He took advantage of Amelio's inexperience in the software business. Alsop was flamed the same way I'm being attacked now."/>
			<outline text="So, I'm not the only one..."/>
			<outline text="***Programmers"/>
			<outline text="Check out Carl's email. It's remarkably honest, if you read it carefully. It begins with &quot;it seems like.&quot; It seems like you believe this, and therefore you must believe this, and that's unfair. He says how I seem to him, and then responds to that image. By the time you string the &quot;seems&quot; together, you can be talking to anyone. When you have to say &quot;it seems&quot; to support your argument, you're really responding to yourself, not the person you're addressing. I become the central person in their life who never listened to them, when in fact I'm a stranger."/>
			<outline text="Programmers gone astray. People who in their normal lives must seek the truth, but when they talk to another human, forget the scientific method. I recommend reading a piece I wrote in May entitled &quot;Programmers&quot;. It would give them some insight into my personality and philosophy. I am a programmer. I seek the truth. I do the best I can. Please get to know me before you tell me who I am. I am an unusually easy person to get to know because so much of my writing is publicly available. So many shortcuts. So many messages that must really be intended for their mothers and fathers. How sad!"/>
			<outline text="I sent Gordon Eubanks, the CEO of Symantec, an email saying that I know that Carl doesn't speak for him or for Symantec. But I wanted to share this example, to spread it around, so I don't have to deal with it on my own. This stuff disturbs me, and for that I thank the people who send these emails. Clearly I can learn something from this experience, and I'm sure it has nothing to do with the Mac or the pain that some Mac users feel."/>
			<outline text="***MacUser gets in the act"/>
			<outline text="A new story on the MacUser website from Rik Myslewski. He calls me a chimpanzee. Wow! Takes my breath away. There's no respectful disagreement in his piece. He doesn't add anything to the discussion of what's to become of the Mac. He doesn't offer any new ideas, but he does invite people to send me mail, and I don't suppose it's going to be fan mail that I get."/>
			<outline text="http://www4.zdnet.com/macuser/onlinecol/myslewski19.html "/>
			<outline text="I think this is totally irresponsible, and not consistent with the usually high editorial standards of Ziff-Davis Publishing. Even personal attacks are better than inviting email attacks. Mr. Myslewski says &quot;Read Jesse's story, and then tell Jesse -- and Dave -- what you think.&quot; What do *you* think Mr. Myslewski? Other than name-calling, it's not in his piece. Shame on him, and MacUser and Ziff-Davis for promoting such vicious use of electronic media."/>
			<outline text="This won't get me to stop writing about the Mac when I feel it's appropriate to do so. And I don't appreciate MacUser using their good name to invite attacks."/>
			<outline text="***To the spammers"/>
			<outline text="A request to the spammers. Before you click on the Send button, call a friend and tell them why you're upset. Someone who knows you, who will listen to you. Your brother or sister, wife or husband, girlfriend or boyfriend, therapist or golf partner. Get heard. Open your heart. Let it out. After that, if you still have something to say to me, let's hear it. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="I wish everyone a peaceful and happy and productive Thursday!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Many of the writers that the spammers attack are Mac users and are concerned about the future of the platform. This is a sensible place to be if you use a Mac. If the spammers used kindness and respect instead of attacks, we could work together and learn from each other. But when the attacks get so personal, people tend to tune out. Human nature at work."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Carl and the Two Guys&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/21/97; 8:40:22 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I've been emailing with Carl from Symantec, the man whose mail I quoted in &quot;Attacks&quot;, 7/17/97. Now I see that he's a reasonable and responsible person with a beautiful sense of humor and a balanced perspective. I admire Carl's courage, intelligence and passion. He challenges me. Thank you. "/>
			<outline text="Carl hasn't asked for an apology and I totally appreciate that. I think we both had a strong positive experience. I learned a lot, felt a bunch of pain, and grew through it. "/>
			<outline text="My anger was evoked. I felt pinned down. I felt invaded and protective. "/>
			<outline text="The experience changed me. "/>
			<outline text="***A fresh perspective"/>
			<outline text="Last week I was getting hundreds of emails, many of which were very personal. Carl's message was just one of them. I've been flamed before and wrote about it. This time I wanted to provide a concrete example of such an email. I wanted my readers to see what it looks like. "/>
			<outline text="Carl's email was not an extreme example, and it was emotional and emotive. It was a beautiful message when viewed from a fresh perspective, outside my point of view of last week."/>
			<outline text="***Friendship"/>
			<outline text="Let's heal our wounds. I don't care if you use a Mac or used to use a Mac, I can play with anyone who uses a web browser. The web is just a LAN. The differences between platforms matter less and less. Carl and I can work on Macs, others can use Unix or NT or Windows 95 or Be or Rhapsody or whatever might come down the road. "/>
			<outline text="Carl you're my brother. I love your passion. I love what you do. I agree, let's be nice to each other. Let's enable each other's creativity instead of paralyzing each other in fear. I'll keep saying what I have to say, and I'll keep listening to you. That's what friendship and brotherhood are all about."/>
			<outline text="***Nice things"/>
			<outline text="Carl asks that I say some nice things about the Mac, its developers, users and the platform vendor. I can do that. And I can also take it somewhere that I think would further the healing. Read on..."/>
			<outline text="Some of my best friends are Mac developers. My admiration for them is a constant theme in DaveNet. And some of the most creative people in the world use Macs. And many who used to use Macs have fond memories of those days. There's a lot of goodwill for the Mac in the world. Let's acknowledge that."/>
			<outline text="We give a lot of our pain to Apple, and that's not appropriate. Apple is just a company. They make boxes with chips inside. They are very good boxes! I use their computers. Thank you Apple, seriously."/>
			<outline text="***A long road"/>
			<outline text="But Apple is also a myth. The two guys in a garage. The 1984 ad. We won't be assimilated. We are not mindless, we are creative. It was a great rallying cry back then."/>
			<outline text="My view of Apple has always been from the outside, I've never worked at the company. I ported software from from Unix to CP/M to the Apple II, then to the IBM PC, then to the Mac and now to Win32. A long road with lots of platforms; even so, there hasn't been a day since 1979 that I wasn't invested, at times with all my assets, in software built around Apple's products."/>
			<outline text="A long road. At times I worked with Apple people toward a common goal, and at times we were bitter adversaries. A mixed experience. In March of this year I did a project with about a dozen Apple people. They opened my eyes. Sweet wonderful people. We could finish each other's sentences, there were areas in which we were in total agreement, on the same side, ready to play."/>
			<outline text="But there was also a gap, old wounds and misunderstandings that hadn't healed. I had never met these people, but it turns out that some had played invisible roles in my struggle with Apple in the early 90s. Then the layoffs came and all of my new friends were gone. There was no time to learn how to work together."/>
			<outline text="I learned that there was and probably still is intelligence, grace, elegance and generosity inside Apple. But the inside story of Apple is also one of frustration. A perennial ladder of unconsciousness and unconnected intelligence and intent and committment. "/>
			<outline text="At the field level, in the programmer's offices and evangelism there were people with passion in their eyes. But there was fear and greed too. The fear stopped them from acknowledging Microsoft and others. The greed caused people to work for personal glory, not for the empowerment of Mac users and developers."/>
			<outline text="***The myth of two guys"/>
			<outline text="At its core Apple is the myth of the two guys in a garage, believing in themselves and empowering others. It's the imagery of the 1984 ad, us versus them, a position that helped Apple revive in the mid-eighties, but stood in the way of the Macintosh as Windows became popular."/>
			<outline text="Now the myth of the two guys is in our way. In my life, never has a myth so much needed to be exploded. Look at all the important fun work we have to do. Upgrading the web. Keeping free speech free. Making sure creativity isn't stifled by Microsoft's power. Everyone has a stake in these things. The Mac and its community can play a role, but only if we let go of the two-guys myth and acknowledge that our power comes from ourselves and each other, not from Jobs and Wozniak."/>
			<outline text="***A repeated story"/>
			<outline text="The myth also pervades Microsoft, JavaSoft and Netscape. The myth of the heroes, Gates, Kapor, Andreessen, Gosling, Ellison, Joy. These are just real people who can never achieve our ambitions for them. The press inflates the images, I don't know why, and the people try to fill the images. Some users believe and are let down. What pressure! "/>
			<outline text="I've seen this effect spoil many lives. I've seen people ask for it, and get it. It's even killed people. We can forgive the icons for seeking our admiration. And they can stop asking for it."/>
			<outline text="***The root of our pain"/>
			<outline text="I believe the root of our pain is the two guys myth. Jobs and Wozniak are still alive. They could let us go, set us free, tell the truth clearly. The garage has been gone for a long time, if it ever existed (only they know). They could believe in our freedom and thereby gain their own. No new operating system is needed, no acquisition or dissolution. "/>
			<outline text="We just need a new mission, a new place in the world. We do not revolve around the Mac and we never will. It's not going to happen. Let it go. The revolution is over. Let's use our computers and focus on creativity, not on the deification of the two guys or the company they started so long ago."/>
			<outline text="***A time for kindness"/>
			<outline text="The two guys were powerful young men, and now they're powerful mature men. It's time for kindness. We're living out their struggle, the whole computer world feels it, the press writes about it. The struggle between the two guys becomes the division between large numbers of good people. "/>
			<outline text="Right now, at this point in time, there's no CEO at Apple to protect. It's the perfect time to tell the truth. It would set the stage for a new CEO to get on with business, remove the burden of supporting the myth, and allow Apple, its users and developers, to find new relevence in the different world of the late 90s."/>
			<outline text="This is exactly the time to think about Apple and heal its wounds. A fluid situation. Many lessons to learn. Few people to protect."/>
			<outline text="A hug and a handshake and a confident smile, forgiveness and brotherhood. Steve and Steve are icons, but they are also just people. I bet it would be a relief to them to let go of the struggle and get on with their contribution to freedom and friendship and making the world a better place."/>
			<outline text="***If you agree"/>
			<outline text="If you agree, this one time, please do not send me or anyone else email. There's been too much thoughtless and hurtful email. Make a contribution to breaking the cycle."/>
			<outline text="Be thoughtful, go on with your life, be kind to yourself and everyone else, and be confident that you can do whatever you want to do, use whatever kind of computer you want to use, be friends with whoever you choose to be friends with."/>
			<outline text="Please respect other people's power, and love them for their struggles, passions and uniqueness."/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/22/97; 8:48:37 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A brief piece with a pointer and some points..."/>
			<outline text="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/5350.html "/>
			<outline text="Dan Bricklin's new company Trellix has a product with the same name that's doing something new and bold. It's a net-aware outliner that supports linking but does not do HTML. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.trellix.com/ "/>
			<outline text="I have a one word comment: Bravo!"/>
			<outline text="***HTML is tired"/>
			<outline text="HTML is getting more complex and providing even less bang for the buck. Cascading style sheets, two flavors of dynamic HTML, it's not getting more beautiful, it's just getting more powerful. "/>
			<outline text="HTML -- great training wheels for net-based information. We needed HTML to get the networking boom to go commercial. We still need HTML as the lowest common denominator, the format that everyone can read. "/>
			<outline text="***Wizzy"/>
			<outline text="The HTML tools situation is dire. For a reason. Read on..."/>
			<outline text="Wizzy is short-hand for WYSIWYG. WYSIWYG is an acronym for What You See Is What You Get. Designers have been clamoring for wizzy HTML tools. The software industry tried to create them, PageMill, HomePage, FrontPage, but most professionally designed sites are done with text tools, BBEdit or Notepad. "/>
			<outline text="We could have saved a lot of time because it's not possible to do a wizzy tool for HTML because HTML is not wizzy. It's not what you see is what you get. It's what you see has little to do with what they see."/>
			<outline text="***Dig a new hole"/>
			<outline text="Can we move beyond HTML? Yes! "/>
			<outline text="A few months ago I had a flash. Instead of telling the designers we can't do wizzy tools, let's find a way to do them. The answer was simple, we need a new display format that is wizzy. It's not rocket science. A draw program or page layout model would be great for webbed information. A browser built around Shockwave would be great too."/>
			<outline text="I don't dig plug-ins. I see more room for improvement in the infrastructure of webbed information. More powerful client-side persistent storage. Better scripting and debugging tools. Stronger connections to content development systems. "/>
			<outline text="I've been investigating ways for my company, UserLand Software, to participate in this part of the market, so I have an interest in new ways to browse."/>
			<outline text="***Trellix"/>
			<outline text="I think there should be 100 different ways to browse networked information. Trellix has gone first. More innovation in networked information is the right road. TCP programming caught the commercial software industry by surprise. Now three years after the boom started, ambitious developers are ready to blaze new trails. I encourage others to take a close look at Trellix. I plan to."/>
			<outline text="***Bricklin"/>
			<outline text="Dan is a friend. We worked together in the early 80s at Personal Software. I was doing a product for them called VisiText which never shipped (it became ThinkTank) and Dan was doing VisiCalc along with Bob Frankston and a group of very talented people. Take Dan seriously. He's got a deep creative imagination and he's driven! He taught me a lot back then, and I expect we'll have fun again this time around."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I'm meeting this evening with Bricklin for a demo and a talk."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Linking is very hot. It's the central concept of networked information. All future formats have to support linking or they won't be interesting."/>
			</outline>
		<outline text="Trellix" created="7/23/1997;  7:50:10 AM" name="trellix" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Trellix&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/23/97; 7:50:10 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="One of the things I like about this job -- I get to dive in with people, to find out how they think, challenge them, and hear first-hand how they do what they do."/>
			<outline text="I spent about five hours with Dan Bricklin, danb@trellix.com, last night. We go a long way back, many mutual friends, but in all those years we had never spent this much time in one place just doing what we do -- talking, demoing, laughing, and interrupting each other. "/>
			<outline text="Dan brought a small PC and a projector and a portable screen and showed me Trellix, several times. There are lots of bits of his experience in the software, from VisiCalc to TK!Solver, his Demo Program, and the pen-based personal information software he did in the early 90s."/>
			<outline text="So what is Trellix? I missed the point yesterday, in &quot;Challenging HTML&quot;, when I said it was a net-based outliner. Trellix is something else. Is it challenging HTML? Yes it is. But the challenge is part of a trance! Read on..."/>
			<outline text="***How Trellix works"/>
			<outline text="Each Trellix document is a collection of pages linked in a colorful editable diagram called the map. In the map, each page appears as a little box. You can click on the box to display the page contents."/>
			<outline text="Every page is displayed thru a template. There are standard elements that define a page, the template designer can format these in a variety of ways. A nice separation between design and content. The templating system feels like a presentation program, like PowerPoint or Lotus Freelance."/>
			<outline text="The Map editor is a hybrid of spreadsheet, slide sorter and draw program. Little boxes connected with lines that direct the flow. Remember Project X that Apple was promoting last year? Trellix's navigation authoring map editor is a quiet, usable implementation of that idea. It also reminds me of Boxes and Arrows, a mid-80s project at Living Videotext that never shipped as a commercial product."/>
			<outline text="In Trellix, the map and all its linked pages and templates are stored in a single file. It's totally self-contained. This is very different from websites, which are collections of linked files, and associated style sheets, graphic bits and channel definitions. The Trellix approach is higher level. Other web tools, such as Fusion and my own Frontier, store the content in a database and render collections of HTML files. "/>
			<outline text="Trellix is weak at generating HTML (more on that later) but very easy for its own structures. So in yesterday's piece when I said they broke with HTML, I got that right. And I believe, even more strongly, that this software is not about HTML, even though it can produce HTML output."/>
			<outline text="***Internet Internet Internet"/>
			<outline text="After seeing the second demo, I said &quot;But Dan, this not about the Internet!&quot; He agreed. I was surprised. &quot;But the word 'Internet' is all over your press materials,&quot; I said in a challenging tone. I went to the kitchen to get the press kit. Oooops. The word isn't in there. Not once. Uh oh. What's going on here?"/>
			<outline text="A trance! The Internet is so pervasive in 1997 that every product, every new startup, is assumed to be completely embedded in it. It's not true of Trellix. It gains its Internet-embedding from the operating system, Windows; its inspiration comes from web browsers; but it serves a different purpose."/>
			<outline text="***A different purpose"/>
			<outline text="Trellix is a productivity app. It may be the first productivity app designed after the web happened. You can totally see the influence."/>
			<outline text="It's a structured writing tool, it's a presentation tool, it can present a web of ideas, richer and more complex than PowerPoint and Persuasion without overloading the reader. In that is its positioning. "/>
			<outline text="Trellix is part word processor, part presenter, part spreadsheet, and its documents are webbed, which makes it different from previous productivity apps."/>
			<outline text="When to use it? "/>
			<outline text="If you've got a complex idea to present then Trellix is where you should work."/>
			<outline text="***HTML"/>
			<outline text="Trellix can generate an HTML website from one of its structured documents. But you can't fully recreate the Trellix experience this way. If reviewers evaluate it in comparison to other HTML-generating productivity apps, Globetrotter comes to mind, Trellix is going to get boxed into the position of a wizzy tool that attempts to generate HTML content. Not a good place to be, IMHO."/>
			<outline text="When you look at Trellix, I urge you to think bigger than HTML and websites. Trellix does something bigger, and it can go somewhere even more interesting. "/>
			<outline text="Bricklin and his team have the experience and depth to evolve the idea. I'll watch with interest."/>
			<outline text="***Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="Did you see Fargo? It was my favorite movie from last year... A captivating story graphically told. And it's the first movie to feature actors speaking in midwestern US English. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/25/97; 10:04:02 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A helpful tip for reporters who are being flamed by zealots..."/>
			<outline text="First, everyone who writes publicly should be able to listen to thoughtful criticism, factual disagreement, or different conclusions drawn from the same set of facts. That's part of the value of writing publicly. This kind of discourse is a good thing."/>
			<outline text="Guy Kawasaki writes in Forbes that writers should publish their email addresses so people can respond. I agree with Guy, as far as this goes. Unfortunately, especially when you write about Apple, much of the email you get is invasive, and I believe dangerous to directly respond to."/>
			<outline text="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/97/0728/6002086a.htm "/>
			<outline text="***How to recognize an invasion"/>
			<outline text="It's not a big deal when someone mis-spells your name, it could be an accident; but it *is* a big deal when they tell you why you're so bitter or demand something from you other than to be heard."/>
			<outline text="You can't respond to challenges that enter areas of your life that are off-limits, such as masculinity or femininity, your quality as a person, your right to live (death threats), or your true motivations. Much of the email is incredibly arrogant. I know why you're doing this, there's no point asking because you'd lie. "/>
			<outline text="Zzzzzz, on good days. Ouch! (on not so good days)."/>
			<outline text="***A secret formula"/>
			<outline text="I've found a secret formula that helps steer a conversation into safe territory. I ask the writer who he or she is. Where does your passion come from? How long have you been using a Mac? What experiences have you had using a Mac, negative or positive?"/>
			<outline text="It's amazing how that can transform the conversation. The response, if thoughtful, can help you empathize. There's something to learn from each person, even someone who starts a conversation by invading your space."/>
			<outline text="So before I give up, I've tried a simple three-word response. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/25/97; 9:44:12 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Closing a loop today and opening another. "/>
			<outline text="***A vision for Apple"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Carl and the Two Guys&quot;, 7/21/97, I said that Apple and the Mac need a new vision, a new purpose, one that reflects the reality of the late 90s, not the late 70s."/>
			<outline text="I asked the two founders of Apple, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak to take a look at the Apple situation and to talk about it publicly. With no CEO at Apple to protect, I believe now would be a good time to talk about what Apple was, what Apple is, and what it could be in the future."/>
			<outline text="I got a thoughful response from Steve Wozniak. I would be happy to run or point to a response from Steve Jobs. A dialog here could be truly historic and healing."/>
			<outline text="***Steve Wozniak and the Garage"/>
			<outline text="From Steve Wozniak, steve@woz.org:"/>
			<outline text="I'm very shy personally and don't like being the subject of myths. I try to hide out from the spotlight and find constructive things that I can do in my small personal world, such as helping local schools. I can only do little things there but in each class I help a few young people go further. It may be just a little bit but it's something positive that I can do, so I'm glad to do it."/>
			<outline text="Apple needs to make prudent business decisions along the lines of maximizing profitability more than anything else right now. Myths of where the company came from probably do get in the way. "/>
			<outline text="I would suggest that the company needs a concise purpose, a set of values, a direction. Some things that the employees can feel as a family about. Some things that to make them proud of where they are. Some values or purposes so good that the brightest graduates *want* to come here. Something to replace or augment the myth of which you speak."/>
			<outline text="But the company is having extreme difficulties. It's hard to get any two people to agree on what the company should be. In times like this, it's easier for outsiders who care, like yourself, to see things that the company needs. "/>
			<outline text="My feeling is that the best approaches involve an understanding of how the business operates outside of the company. We should have values that respect developers and customers as though they are part of an extended family. In actions, not just in words. I have never been able to see such a person as less valuable than my own self. But it's hard to run a large corporation when you include so many as party."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Marimba"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Steve!"/>
			<outline text="Switching gears... With Microsoft camped out in great numbers on every standards body, can you blame a small startup company for not wanting to open up their protocols, allowing others to implement compatible clients and servers? "/>
			<outline text="This issue comes up all the time. Can open standards only come from Microsoft? You see this struggle in the strategy of JavaSoft, and now it shows up in Netscape's strategy, in their distribution deal with Marimba, announced yesterday."/>
			<outline text="***A tricky situation"/>
			<outline text="At one time Netscape had the open standards religion. See &quot;Elegant Statements&quot;, 2/10/96. In the heady free-speech days of early 1996, they said on their home page &quot;Netscape supports open standards, including First Amendment rights to free speech.&quot; Oh how beautiful the idealism was. This was Netscape's garage. Now the reality is different."/>
			<outline text="Now, for the first time that I'm aware of, Netscape is selling a client-server combo built on a proprietary closed protocol. It's actually a reasonable response to a world where Microsoft controls the avenues of progress. But it is a shame, a baby-bathwater situation because when they shut out Microsoft they also shut out smaller developers who could help new standards get accepted more quickly."/>
			<outline text="As a user, why should you care? An example -- if you wanted to serve a channel from a database that Marimba doesn't support, you might be able to if the protocol were open. Another example, if you run a Macintosh net server, you might be able to run a Marimba-compatible transmitter since they don't currently offer a transmitter for the Mac OS."/>
			<outline text="These are just examples. I'm aware of unannounced innovations in mail servers that are going to be quite revolutionary. They couldn't work if Internet email weren't built on open standards, SMTP and POP. They could be Marimba-compatible if we knew what that meant."/>
			<outline text="It's a tricky situation for Netscape and Marimba. The quiet period for Internet standards is long over. Now proposed standards must have a proprietary incubation period. That's why &quot;proprietary&quot; is no longer a dirty word. In a world without Microsoft, it would be."/>
			<outline text="***Admirable courage"/>
			<outline text="Before the Internet happened, Microsoft held &quot;design reviews&quot; where groups of outside developers would meet to help direct Microsoft. I participated in several of these in the early 90s and now I see some of my ideas implemented in Microsoft system software. "/>
			<outline text="In that world, Microsoft sets the standard, but we have some influence over what they do. A reasonable situation unless there's an alternative. "/>
			<outline text="Personally, I'd prefer the chaos of an open market. But with a large player such as Microsoft in the market, we quickly fall back to the old equilibrium soon after they made it a priority to be influential in the standards of the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="So Netscape and Marimba are exceptions, they want to promote a standard independently of Microsoft. I wish there were others. I admire their courage."/>

			<outline text="Following up on yesterday's piece, &quot;Steve Wozniak and the Garage&quot; which also included an analysis of the Netscape-Marimba deal, I got an email from Mike McCue, mikem@netscape.com, a lead developer at Netscape, promising that the Castanet protocol would be opened. "/>
			<outline text="He said: &quot;For the record, we are working very hard to make the Marimba protocol an open standard asap. It will usually be the case with fringe features that they are initially non-standard. Then over time the open standards circle will widen to encompasses these features.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Mike. As soon as we get a look at the spec, we'll have a report, of course. Should be interesting!"/>
			<outline text="***Courage"/>
			<outline text="In the last piece I talked about courage and commended Netscape and Marimba for having it. All of us who don't work at Microsoft have a stake in their success, I think, because if we can point to an example of a recent standard that happened without Microsoft driving the process, it would be safe for other people to try new ideas out too. That would be a good thing.The often-cited VHS-Betamax battle had two winners. Let's not buy into black and white. Don't cry for Netscape and Marimba yet. They may have tapped into a big idea, especially if they have the courage to take the next step and open it up."/>
			<outline text="***Business, art, culture"/>
			<outline text="Software offers so many rewards! It's a business, an artform and a culture. When you try to understand why software moves one way or another, I think you have to look at all three sides. "/>
			<outline text="The culture side, to me, is represented by friendships. I go to Windows for business reasons but also to reconnect with old friends who make Windows software. I want to take my Mac friends with me, but I know I can't. I hope the culture we've developed will live beyond and outside the operating system we met on. "/>
			<outline text="I also do software for art. To me this is about breaking rules and mixing functionality from other lifetimes in new ways, and it's also about working with great people. The best art is unpredictable. Add two free people to the mix for an unpredictable result every time."/>
			<outline text="Software is about movement. You don't stop after version 1.0. You keep going places, learning from people who use the software and developers who work with you, but also people who compete with you. "/>
			<outline text="***The best teachers"/>
			<outline text="Part of the fun in software is the other side of the empty feeling in my competitor's belly when he sees the feature list for the next version of my software. It's the same excitement I feel when I do the same."/>
			<outline text="Sometimes when I ship something, the word &quot;Bonk!&quot; comes out of my mouth. I imagine my competitor being hit over the head! It's an immature idea, but it's also proof that my inner child is alive and well, and I dig that."/>
			<outline text="So, who listens to you the best? Good competitors. They can teach you so much. Being open is being open to competition. It forces us and our software to be better, more creative, more subtle and more aggressive. "/>
			<outline text="It offers us new ways to be friends. "/>
			<outline text="***NewsTracker"/>
			<outline text="Switching gears..."/>
			<outline text="NewsTracker is the just in time search engine (JIT-SE) from Excite. It's a very useful tool for following news stories on the web. I last wrote about it in &quot;Two Crazy Days&quot; 7/10/97. From there, follow the links back. The first piece about JIT-SEs was &quot;Floating Ideas&quot;, 9/7/96."/>
			<outline text="I'd still like to play with &quot;Newbot&quot; from Wired, but there have been technical problems. So for now, NewsTracker is the testbed I use to explore the ideas around timely web-based search engines."/>
			<outline text="NewsTracker has already had a positive impact on the Scripting News page. I was able to follow the &quot;Trellix&quot; story, to read other takes on the product before I wrote my own piece. Same with the Marimba-Netscape deal. Newstracker found an early Bloomberg News report on the New York Times Syndicate website. It was a good piece, and helped put the deal in perspective for me. "/>
			<outline text="In the software world I like it when I can stand on someone's shoulders, and I also like it when someone stands on mine. The web, for writers, offers the same opportunity. We can all reinvent the wheel, or we can learn from each other. NewsTracker makes learning easier."/>
			<outline text="***Looking forward"/>
			<outline text="NewsTracker is a great start, but I want it to keep moving. There's room for improvement, as I see it, in three areas: user interface, better filtering and better coordination with the sites they index."/>
			<outline text="First the user interface issue. When you go to the NewsTracker home page it can be hard to spot the just-in-time part. The solution -- a special entry page:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/specials/newsTracker.html "/>
			<outline text="You can bookmark this page. I'll leave it right where it is. If Excite puts up a simple entry page for their JIT-SE I'll redirect to it from this page."/>
			<outline text="***Better filtering"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday when I did a search for Marimba, the list of hits included articles on McAfee, new music formats and CMP's public offering, articles that have nothing to do with Marimba. Why? Because news sites often use a template with links to all their hot stories on each page. The word 'Marimba' appears on these pages, but only in links to an articles about Marimba."/>
			<outline text="This problem ultimately will be solved by better separation of content from form, a new architecture for the web. In the meantime, NewsTracker does an incredible job of building summaries of the articles, so maybe they can guess what's structure and what's not. This not in my area of expertise."/>
			<outline text="An interesting sidebar, within a few days the filtering issue goes away as the sites rebuild their pages from new templates and NewsTracker picks up the change in its next traversal. "/>
			<outline text="***Better coordination"/>
			<outline text="It's not clear how much scanning NewsTracker does, how deep its traversal goes, or how tuned it is into changes that happen on my site. Do they just scan the home page and follow links that stay on my server? Do they visit all the back-issues of DaveNet in every scan (this would be wasteful, back issues change very rarely)."/>
			<outline text="Back in April I was thinking about this issue and came up with an automated way to help direct search engines to the stuff that changed. This page has been maintained by a background script since April 29."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/siteChanges.txt "/>
			<outline text="It's a tab-indented file with one top-level line for each day, each second-level line is the URL of a page that changed during the day, and the third-level line is the exact time of the last change to the page."/>
			<outline text="A JIT-SE could read this file once a day, index each of the pages that changed, and then go on. It would be efficient, would allow the engine to index more sites, or more important, index sites more frequently."/>
			<outline text="We could generate this file every hour or every ten minutes, as could any webmaster who can run a script. We've posted the full source to the Frontier suite that generates this file, and have no problem if people port it to PERL,Visual Basic, tcl or AppleScript or modify the Frontier suite for their own purposes."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/fatpages/97/04/siteChanges.html "/>
			<outline text="***CDF?"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft thinks that CDF is the answer here, but I don't see their stake in this area, since most leading news sites are not run by Microsoft or built using their tools, and they don't run a search engine. "/>
			<outline text="More imporant, there's a basic philosophical difference between the SiteChanges idea and CDF. We don't point to pages that could change, we point to pages that did change. This is lower level, simpler, easier to generate, more low tech and most important, we don't have to wait for Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="That said, we'd be happy to change the format, change the frequency and perhaps generate more information, but only in coordination with one or more search engines. If Microsoft wants to show us how to express this in CDF, we'll definitely take a look."/>
			<outline text="I think we've got a good starting place. Let's see if anyone wants to play."/>
			<outline text="***my.yahoo.com"/>
			<outline text="A final note, after writing about NewsTracker I got email asking me to check out my.yahoo.com, which people said does what NewsTracker does. "/>
			<outline text="I did check it out, and yes, it has a JIT-SE, but it's not as broad. For example, I only found one Trellix story on Yahoo, but NewsTracker found eight."/>
			<outline text="Further, since Yahoo doesn't index Scripting News, I can't learn how it works from the content side of the connection."/>
			<outline text="Of course, from my point of view, the more the merrier; competition keeps the quality of listening high."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/30/97; 3:46:24 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A couple of weekends ago I went to a private retreat for about seventy creative people, all involved in the online business in one way or another. "/>
			<outline text="I agreed not to write about the conference itself, and I won't break that promise. But I want to talk about a few experiences I had there, stuff that I'm still thinking about almost two weeks after the event."/>
			<outline text="***The evangelist in me came out"/>
			<outline text="On Saturday evening during dinner, between courses, I took a walk, went around the back of the building, chatted with two men, one an attendee at the conference, and another, an older gentleman who was part of a wedding party, not part of our conference."/>
			<outline text="All three of us were Mac users. The older man asked if Apple could survive, my fellow attendee responded and I listened. No one is developing software for the Mac. Everything comes out first on Windows. Corporate MIS directors won't let people buy Macs."/>
			<outline text="Something interesting happened -- I got angry! Took a deep breath. What's going on here? It's not true that there's no new software for the Mac. It's also not true that everything comes out first on Windows. Certainly some people are limited by corporate policies, but I am not one of them. I can use whatever kind of computer I want to. I still use a Mac because much of the software I use doesn't run on Windows. That's my reality."/>
			<outline text="But I'm mostly angry because the younger man is interfering. Why does he have so much at stake in the outcome of the Mac that he's willing to believe things that are not true? Perceptions! he argues. It doesn't matter if there's valuable software that only runs on the Mac. People think there isn't any, and that's what's important."/>
			<outline text="I got angry because he's interfering with my livelihood both as a developer who continues to invest in the Mac, and as a writer and webmaster who uses tools that only run on a Mac, some of which will probably never be ported."/>
			<outline text="The evangelist in me came out... I went back to the dinner table on a mission to fully experience the world thru the eyes of a Mac zealot, to seek their truth, and at the same time to keep my eyes and ears open, to see if I could learn something here."/>
			<outline text="***Back at the table"/>
			<outline text="&quot;I want to keep using my Mac,&quot; I said. &quot;What do you all think?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The Mac is dead. No software. Old operating system. Apple is failing. Can't use one in a corporation."/>
			<outline text="Probe deeper, every person at the table is either a current Mac user or a cross-user (someone, like me, who uses both a PC and a Mac in their daily work). Once this is clear, new ideas come up -- there's nothing really wrong with the Mac, it's just that Apple is evaporating, fueling the downward spiral, making Windows a safer choice for software developers and corporate planners. "/>
			<outline text="I have this belief too, as I've said many times in DaveNet. I felt that the Mac had a strong Internet story, and that the growth that Microsoft is now experiencing was available in a smaller dose for the Mac market. Only Apple could stand in the way, and of course that's exactly what they did."/>
			<outline text="Oooops."/>
			<outline text="***Where do we go from here?"/>
			<outline text="I hope they get some calm, mature, professional marketing people in the next Apple organization. I hope they run focus groups with Mac users from a variety of walks of life -- creative people, students, teachers, geeks. I hope they listen, and before they run their ads, form a strategy around the undersold assets of the Mac platform, programs like WebSTAR and &quot;BBEdit&quot; that do powerful things for Mac users that you can't do on Windows. Reinforce the position of the software that Mac users depend on, the stuff that makes it so difficult to switch."/>
			<outline text="One attendee pointed out that the Mac is a great text machine. It's true! The wealth of tools is amazing. Any Apple person who wants details, send me an email, and we'll talk. There are unmarketed nuggets scattering the Mac landscape but still in use. Like a SimCity with a broken power plant, just turn the power back on, even at this late date, all that's needed is a will to win, and a philosophy of win-win."/>
			<outline text="***I'm stubborn"/>
			<outline text="Once again I'm making offers to Apple."/>
			<outline text="Each time thru this loop I've learned something about myself -- I don't give up easily! Oh man. "/>
			<outline text="We keep working on our Windows software, but our Mac stuff is so far ahead, why can't we all work together and make something happen here?"/>
			<outline text="Can Apple afford to keep saying no to people and companies who have invested in the Mac platform?"/>

			<outline text="Oh what's to become of Apple? So much hand-wringing! The reporters go into a frenzy. Will Jobs come back? Won't he? Why not? The reality distortion field flickers on, then off, then on again. Bzzzz. It gets you high! "/>
			<outline text="***He was a beautiful young man"/>
			<outline text="Steve Jobs was big news in the 1980s with the original Macintosh. It was an incredible accomplishment. I remember when I saw the first Mac, in 1983. It really spoke to me. What an unusual thing it was. And what an unusual young man Steve Jobs was. "/>
			<outline text="I sat in the audience on the 1/24/84 rollout of the Mac. Jobs beams at the crowd and the TV cameras. Pretend you're him. Applause. Take a deep breath. Bring the tips of your fingers together. Nod your head slightly. Cheers! Turn up the beams! Smile from ear to ear. The audience rises to its feet. They love you! Soak it in. What a rush!"/>
			<outline text="What a beautiful young man Steve Jobs was! How beautiful and young he made us feel reflecting off his brilliance."/>
			<outline text="***I was there"/>
			<outline text="I drank the Kool Aid. Jobs's Apple provided the air cover, we made software. Deals and ads and new markets. The money rolled in. It was a great time to be a young man for me too. "/>
			<outline text="Eventually the magic was over, Jobs left Apple fuming and Apple grew to become a huge incompetent American computer company with a bad attitude. Amazingly the roads intertwined; at the end of 1996 Jobs came back. "/>
			<outline text="But the magic time is long gone. It can't come back. The world changed."/>
			<outline text="***The world changed"/>
			<outline text="Next Wednesday in Boston Steve Jobs will speak, presumably with John Warnock and Larry Ellison supporting him. With his old adversaries Sculley, Gassee, Amelio and the old board out of the way, the cloners left in the dust, Jobs can tell us what he wants to do; and no one can say no. "/>
			<outline text="But it's not the mid-80s anymore, it's the late 90s. Personal computers are commonplace. There's a lot more work to do, but the excitement isn't about new computer hardware, it's about connections between people. "/>
			<outline text="Toshiba, IBM, Gateway, Compaq and Dell make great computers. Apple makes great computers too. So do Motorola, Power Computing and UMAX. When Jobs left Apple they were still doing something unusual at Apple. Not any more. "/>
			<outline text="Jobs and Ellison talk about Network Computers. This is OK with me if it means that the low-end of the Apple product line will get Ethernet ports. Today only expensive Macs can easily hook up to a fast LAN."/>
			<outline text="***What is going on there?"/>
			<outline text="Apple can be a profitable if unglamorous business because there are so many Mac users who would love to buy a faster, bigger and easier computer next year and the year after that."/>
			<outline text="The clone vendors are eating Apple's lunch. According to sources at the clone vendors, Apple has responded by discontinuing licensing the Mac OS, withdrawing their committment to CHRP, and deciding not to license a laptop or their new desktop designs. According to Apple, kiss the clones goodbye. You hear a different story from the cloners."/>
			<outline text="Jobs appears to be running Apple, but with what authority? He's not a board member or a large shareholder or an officer of the company. What is going on there?"/>
			<outline text="***Simple strategy"/>
			<outline text="Out of all the confusion, some of which seems deliberately created by Jobs, comes a simple strategy -- focus on what the customers want."/>
			<outline text="Customer loyalty is precious. Make faster Mac-compatible computers and charge a little more for it. Make sure it runs our software. And then get out of the way and let some software companies merge and grow to serve these customers. "/>
			<outline text="Further, the cloners are part of the structure of the Mac market. They're selling lots of computers, therefore they have lots of customers. This is not a good time for another jerk of the customer chain."/>
			<outline text="Clearly, Apple needs a CEO who's immersed in the software business of the late 90s, because that's where Apple has to make sense."/>
			<outline text="This strategy won't try to overtake Bill Gates. That's good news, because that means that Microsoft can support Apple. It also has a chance of allowing the Apple brand and its basic software to continue thru end of the decade. "/>
			<outline text="Something big like the web might come along in the interim, and what remains of Apple could latch onto that and start growing again."/>
			<outline text="***Is this Jobs's plan?"/>
			<outline text="What is his plan? We'll have to wait to hear from him."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, Apple's stock price remains low enough to make it an attractive acquisition for IBM, Compaq or Sun. Why would they want to buy Apple? Think of all those confused users. "/>

			<outline text="I started writing yesterday's piece, &quot;He was Beautiful&quot;, on Thursday night when we believed, based on Jobs's email to Pixar employees, that he was going to phase out of Apple after 90 days. "/>
			<outline text="But after Larry Ellison spoke on Friday morning, my head was spinning and so was the story! It sounded like Jobs was going to continue to take a very active role at Apple for a lot longer than 90 days."/>
			<outline text="Then later in the morning news started coming from individuals at several clone vendors, not for attribution, that Apple was withdrawing from its licenses. Ex-Next people said this tactic is &quot;pure Steve.&quot; What a confusing situation. Some think it's a trial balloon, a test to see what the audience reaction would be. If so, it would be cheaper to do some focus groups."/>
			<outline text="It makes some sense for Apple to want out of the clone licenses. An easy way to quickly boost their numbers. It is also a way to quickly separate from the loyalty of Macintosh users, many of whom own machines made by Power Computing and others."/>
			<outline text="***The web is a conversation"/>
			<outline text="One of the differences between the Mac market of 1997 and ten years ago is the web and email. We can respond more quickly now. On Friday morning I asked for inside stories, by the afternoon they came. "/>
			<outline text="And the conversation continues... Earlier this year we were quiet when Exponential folded. Now, an alert that Power Computing may be next. I believe it. A call from inside Softbank yesterday says that MacUser is shutting down. This morning the story is on the Wired News website. "/>
			<outline text="***An association of goodwill"/>
			<outline text="Motorola and IBM could finance an acquisition of the Mac OS. Another OS/2? Perhaps. Or a vibrant platform of users and developers who would appreciate a steadier ride. "/>
			<outline text="Please think longterm now. Mac users will be buying computers for fifty more years. Maybe they'll be buying machines that don't have PowerPC processors or run the Mac OS. "/>
			<outline text="Think of Mac users as you think of people who drive Saturn cars. An association of goodwill that can be purchased very inexpensively right now. Is it a good deal? That's up to the CEOs of the two companies to decide."/>
			<outline text="Sure Motorola and IBM have already invested substantially in the Mac platform. Please see the bigger world, everyone was misled, cloners, developers and users. Get over it. "/>
			<outline text="***Now what do we do?"/>
			<outline text="It's time to make a new investment, for all, or get out. "/>
			<outline text="I suggest that Power Computing may be better aligned with the interests of Mac users and developers than Apple Computer. Power Computing also has a management team and a functioning board of directors, and has the respect and goodwill of developers. They do great marketing. "/>
			<outline text="What's standing in their way? A license that could be purchased even if Apple's current board of directors doesn't want to do the deal. "/>
			<outline text="***Web authoring can be as easy as email"/>
			<outline text="Ellison and Jobs promote the use of the Mac OS as a platform for network computing. I think this is a great idea! I've been promoting it for a long time and have done a lot of thinking and listening, so here's a plan for Mac-based net PCs for 1997..."/>
			<outline text="A ultra-thin notebook form factor. Big color screen. An Ethernet port and lots of RAM (64MB minimum); a one gigabyte hard drive; fast CPU. Starts at $2495, but as the market develops, the price goes down. "/>

			<outline text="Matthew Poncelet, played by Penn, is a convicted rapist/murderer, sentenced to die. Rigidly, he blames everyone but himself for his upcoming death. But in his final minutes he finds his truth and dignity, owns the crime he committed, and dies with a healing message. "/>

			<outline text="After watching the movie I checked my email, did a late night tour of news sites. On the PC WEEK website I found this piece by Rob O'Regan:"/>

			<outline text="He comes to bury the Mac. It has no future. Don't lock your kids in. A dying platform. Apple is bleeding. "/>
			<outline text="Granted, it is labeled as opinion, and if this is truly O'Regan's opinion, who can argue? We all have our own filters, the shades that influence what we see. "/>
			<outline text="***Death"/>
			<outline text="The deathwatch theme is repeated on many news oriented websites, and I wonder if the writers have taken a look at how strange life is, and I wonder if maybe they'll miss the dignity of the Mac community, perhaps in its death throes, but also possibly just transforming into a different form. "/>
			<outline text="The future is not ours to see. We can talk about it, but very often we have the wrong idea, things turn out differently. Around every corner there's a surprise. We hope for a pardon, and if one doesn't come, we can hope for dignity and respect. There's a lot to hope for, a lot to learn, even from death. Especially from death."/>
			<outline text="***Two sides, one story"/>
			<outline text="O'Regan's piece is the flip side of the flame mail we get from Mac zealots when we approach the Apple situation from the other side. It's as if Mr. O'Regan is an executioner, which is a trance -- he's just a columnist. It's as if the flamers are Mr. Poncelet, firmly convinced that they're victimized, and not getting that there are a variety of perspectives, all equally valid. "/>
			<outline text="The bigger picture -- freedom and diversity are essential. If you only hear one point of view, if you're never been stirred into seeing the world from other perspectives, you miss the point of living, I think. That goes for columnists and zealots, equally."/>
			<outline text="To O'Regan, if he aspires to be an emotive writer, look for more subtle themes. Life isn't that simple. A lot of people use Macs, so what? Presumably he doesn't use a Mac. Is that the story? Has he ever been a Mac user? Does he feel a sense of loss in the death he predicts? Why did he write that piece? I don't know. He says the Mac is not a religion. Right on. So why is his writing, about the Mac, filled with such religion-evoking themes?"/>
			<outline text="To others, especially editors at pubs that cover the Mac -- can we avoid words like deathwatch? Certainly some people are watching for death. But if you're looking for life, check out the sales of Mac OS 8, check out the new chip designs from Motorola and IBM, the new performance coming from the CHRP designs, the cross-CPU release of the Be OS, new boxes and new prices from Power Computing, Motorola, UMAX and Apple.

			<outline text="Mike Markkula is out, and that's historically significant, but doesn't say much about the future. There's an opening for a CEO at Apple, and an implicit offer from Jobs to step aside if the new CEO wants him to. Hats off to Jobs and the new board for having the wisdom to keep the door open for a truly powerful leader for Apple."/>
			<outline text="The Java deal is sweet for Microsoft and must be a bitter pill for Sun; but don't cry for them, Sun could have easily bought Apple and kept the good stuff, any time in the last two years. "/>
			<outline text="The Netscape attack is overstated. What did Microsoft get here? What does it mean to be the default browser? Windows has this concept, the Mac OS does not. As long as Apple is bundling both browsers, I don't see what the noise is about. Sounds like a publicist's idea. Maybe I'm missing something."/>
			<outline text="***The secret deal"/>
			<outline text="Apple gave up something we can't evaluate because it's secret. They signed a &quot;broad patent cross-licensing agreement,&quot; but no specifics were offered. According to sources, Microsoft gave the Office-for-five-years concession to avoid an Apple lawsuit. What was Apple going to sue over? "/>
			<outline text="Were there side-deals? Will Office be bundled? Did Microsoft get source code rights for Apple stuff like QuickTime? Will Visual Basic replace AppleScript? What about Rhapsody? There are a bunch of ex-Next people at Microsoft. They'll know what to ask for."/>
			<outline text="***The clone mess"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, as the dust settles, the clone issue hasn't been settled. It's pretty clear from announcements this week that Power Computing and Motorola are in position to kick Apple's butt in performance and value. They're starting to ship reasonable $1000 machines. Apple's protests that the cloners haven't pulled their weight is pure noise. They've been driving the platform forward at a higher rate than Apple has."/>
			<outline text="It seems desperate for Apple to covet the business of the cloners. Apple is dominant in this market. Even if their products were just close to the quality and value of their competitor's products, they should own the whole market because of their brand name and customer loyalty. Apple may need to do a deal with Power or Motorola to stay competitive. "/>
			<outline text="***Noisy deals"/>
			<outline text="The Microsoft deal is a noisy one, a headline-grabber for sure. It sets the stage for more announcements -- don't be surprised if Jobs is on stage with someone from Netscape next week, Sun the week after that, then Adobe and of course Oracle and IBM. But honestly I'd prefer to see them on stage with someone from Power Computing, Bare Bones, Quark, Adobe or Connectix. It would mean more to Mac users."/>
			<outline text="***The positive spin"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, it's good to have Apple back in the middle of things again. Amelio could never sit down at a software industry bargaining table and do something meaningful. Neither could Sculley or Spindler. So this is something new."/>
			<outline text="And Bill Campbell, a member of the church of win-win, is now on Apple's board. I've had the pleasure of doing business with Bill many times in the past, and hope to work with him in his new capacity as an Apple director. "/>
			<outline text="And there's nothing the press loves more than a story about Apple, and Steve Jobs plays the press so damned well. Even after all the doom and gloom pieces over all the years, Apple is still front page material. "/>
			<outline text="***Behind the hype"/>
			<outline text="But behind the hype is a failing commercial enterprise, one that's distant from the market it serves. This time around the loop, Apple's arrogance is lashing out at its users and that's a very dangerous place to be."/>
			<outline text="They're playing a desperate game of chicken, perhaps hoping to sweep the cloning issue aside with noisy announcements. But the issue is still there. The issue is trust. Is Apple telling the truth when they say they are acting in the best interests of the platform? I don't think they are."/>

			<outline text="Linux has been bothering me. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft invested $150 million in Apple to help preserve a competitive platform. I wonder if Microsoft would invest $150 million to help bootstrap a commercial market around the Linux operating system?"/>
			<outline text="Flipped around, what if someone really creative ends up running Apple? Could you turn the Mac OS into a competitor of Linux? As they say in Fargo, yooooo betcha!"/>
			<outline text="I know, the Mac OS is tied to the PowerPC processor, so it can't replace Linux, which is processor independent. But there's a lot of software for the Mac OS that doesn't run on Linux, so I think there's still a reason to push the PowerPC-only OS forward."/>
			<outline text="***Is Linux the Internet of the next decade?"/>
			<outline text="Before the Internet boomed in the mid 90s, I had an intuition that it was the no-brainer choice. But get this, I didn't put my bet down, instead I bet on Apple and the Mac OS. I didn't investigate MacTCP when it came out. If only I had! I wish..."/>
			<outline text="OK. Now I have the same feeling about Linux. "/>
			<outline text="***Two ecosystems"/>
			<outline text="Here's how I think it will shake out. Two operating systems. In a few years we're going to be left with Windows and the other will be a free operating system. "/>
			<outline text="Users will have a choice -- go with the corporate standard or choose to trust the universe. Fear versus love. They both sell in the computer world."/>
			<outline text="***The Macintosh ecosystem"/>
			<outline text="I laugh out loud when I hear Jobs and Apple execs talking about the Macintosh ecosystem. What information do these guys have other than balance sheets to go by? Numbers give you one slice, the view of a company, but they tell you very little about the culture of interests gathered around it. "/>
			<outline text="Another way to experience the ecosystem is to be part of it. Check it out, Mac users and developers are anti-corporate by nature. That's the culture of the Mac. So to align your interests with the users you pretty much have to be anti-corporate too. But Apple is a corporation, and totally acts like one. But the hype says otherwise (the two guys in a garage, which Jobs unfortunately referred to in his speech on Wednesday). "/>
			<outline text="My maternal grandfather, the businessman in my family, had a bit of advice. &quot;Pay for your sins,&quot; he would have said to Apple. Apple's sin is saying they are anti-corporate when they behave totally like a corporation. To get back on track Apple is going to have to resove that conflict. No way around it, all the great PR possible won't fix this disconnect."/>
			<outline text="***Apple is always in chaos"/>
			<outline text="Apple points the finger at the cloners, let's point the finger back at Apple. But who would you point to? It's funny! Apple is always in chaos. No one is responsible. People say Apple did this or Apple said that. Who at Apple and which Apple? "/>
			<outline text="But there actually is a corporation named Apple and a track record to look at and an economic system to study. Here's what they do -- they cancel huge R&amp;D projects and start new ones, buy whole operating systems, fire CEOs and reorganize twice a year. All these adventures cost huge money. It's as if your boat had been hit by a cruise missle and you're blaming a minor leak for sinking your ship. "/>
			<outline text="In contrast, the cloners run small profitless ships, but are pushing the envelope on price, performance, quality and service. "/>
			<outline text="***Exploiting an ecosystem"/>
			<outline text="What does Apple bring to the party? The hardware engineers at Apple seem to be falling behind the ones at the cloners. Where will the great engineers at the other companies go when Apple shuts them down? They'll probably get great jobs at Intel, HP, Dell, Compaq, Gateway, Cisco making Windows machines. "/>
			<outline text="Apple also has the exclusive right to develop the Macintosh OS. 100 engineers work on revisions to the Mac OS and they have a great software distribution system. "/>
			<outline text="When they say they're managing an ecosystem at Apple, what I hear is that they're exploiting an ecosystem. At Apple they don't just leak money, they build huge bonfires of burning money. Same old thing. It's not because they're bad or evil people, it's just that they're insulated from what's going on around them. No one is empowered to change the system. They're focused on their internal drama, and want us to be focused on it too."/>
			<outline text="***Oh what you can miss..."/>
			<outline text="This puzzle originally ran in DaveNet in February 1997."/>
			<outline text="How many F's in this sentence? &quot;Finished files are the result of years of scientific study combined with the experience of years.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The correct answer is 6. No tricks. Most people find 3. If you're like me, you didn't see the F's in the word &quot;of&quot; which appears three times in the sentence. "/>
			<outline text="Conclusion -- most of what we see is what we're trained to see.  Creativity is understanding these patterns and looking for algorithms that allow you to find what you're looking for anyway. Business as usual finds three F's. A disciplined creative person finds six."/>
			<outline text="See &quot;Programmers&quot;, 5/7/97, for more ideas."/>
			<outline text="***Apple is confusing"/>
			<outline text="People who know about the F's are less distracted by reality distortion fields."/>
			<outline text="I'm so confused by Apple. No CEO, a major reorg coming for sure, and another pipeline of innovation being shut down. Steve Jobs, the great storyteller, is continuing to tell the big lie. It's a corporate board he assembled, not a band of pirates! This Apple wasn't invented in a garage, it comes from Dupont, Oracle and Kleiner. In flagrante delicto. "/>
			<outline text="Reading MacWorld, MacUser, MacWEEK, Macintouch, Webintosh, SJ Mercury, News.com, Wired, this week I saw the same result -- we're all disconnecting from Apple, seeing the Mac OS as something we're interested in, Steve Jobs too, and perhaps Apple; but they're all different things with different interests."/>
			<outline text="To the people who are responsible for Apple, the new board, we're all older now, we are more experienced, we've been around this loop over and over. Jobs, Anderson and De Luca are asking us to do it again, to trust Apple to control the flow of new ideas into the Mac market."/>
			<outline text="Here's the answer -- no."/>
			<outline text="***Who's thinking for Apple?"/>
			<outline text="Look at it another way, everyone Apple is blowing off is ready to return the favor. Most of the major software has been ported to Windows. IBM and Motorola can curtail advancement of the PowerPC chip. The users can buy Windows machines. "/>
			<outline text="***Free the Mac OS"/>
			<outline text="I can't worry about Apple now, that's not my job. "/>
			<outline text="I would love to see something happen with the Mac OS. As a cash cow for Apple, I believe it can't go anywhere. I think it's been that way for a long time."/>
			<outline text="We'll figure out a way to pay the 100 engineers and we'll replace the software distribution system with a website. "/>
			<outline text="I want it to be free. "/>

			<outline text="PS: In flagrante delicto means &quot;in the very act of committing the offense; red-handed.&quot; Loosely translated in DaveNet-ese: &quot;Ooops&quot;."/>
			<outline text="PPS: To people who are dealing with Apple now, my guess is that all bets are off when the new CEO is named."/>

			<outline text="More information is available today thanks to a Time Magazine cover story on Steve Jobs about the dramatic speech and announcements he made last Wednesday on behalf of Apple Computer."/>
			<outline text="http://www.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/1997/dom/970818/cover1.html "/>
			<outline text="***Which way Steve? "/>
			<outline text="Negatives -- yes, he did sell his Apple stock in June. He says &quot;If that upsets employees, I'm perfectly happy to go home to Pixar.&quot; Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="And he appears to not use a Macintosh, which probably means he'll have a hard time understanding the new software that's been developed for the Mac OS since he stopped using a Mac, whenever that was."/>
			<outline text="Reminds me of a great Little Feat song. One foot on the platform and one foot on the train. "/>
			<outline text="Which way Steve? Reminds me of a piece I wrote in March of last year, &quot;Which Way Gil?&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Chugga chugga chugga, the train keeps on going. Gil didn't grok the Mac, and Steve doesn't use one. Can we call this progress?"/>
			<outline text="***It's so confusing"/>
			<outline text="Stepping out of the reality distortion field, let's get real, Jobs is acting like a CEO, making big deals, designing the strategy for the company; doing the kinds of things a CEO does."/>
			<outline text="Is this a plus or minus? A plus, perhaps: the big news organizations love a Steve Jobs story. It's hard to imagine another person getting the kind of coverage he's been able to get on Apple's behalf. "/>
			<outline text="But maybe he'll go back to Pixar, and what will be left? He could shrug his shoulders, &quot;I tried,&quot; he might say. What does he have to lose? His stock is cashed out, if Apple goes down, Jobs loses nothing."/>
			<outline text="Jobs zigs and zags, weaves and manipulates. He's hard to follow. Last Wednesday he wondered why users and developers are confused about Apple's commitment to the Mac OS. To understand this, all he has to do is read his own words. May's developer conference was a hard sell for Rhapsody. "/>
			<outline text="Now we're hearing more realism -- Jobs came to his senses and realized that Mac OS is a cash cow that they need to preserve. Voila! "/>
			<outline text="Next step: View the Mac OS as a strategic asset because it has a strong base of software that makes it more competitive with other education and web content platforms. "/>
			<outline text="The leader of Apple, whoever that might be, is going to have to roll up his or her sleeves and understand how the Mac market works. Step one, lose the ThinkPad Steve and use the same machine and operating system your users use. "/>
			<outline text="***Meet the new CEO"/>
			<outline text="Let's cut thru the crap. We're being manipulated here. Read the tea leaves and let's get on with it."/>
			<outline text="Could a new Apple CEO compete with Jobs on the cover of Time? No way. Whether or not Jobs wants to be CEO is irrelevant. If he quits Apple will deflate. The press will attack again. When Apple's new board meets they'll have to go with the no brainer choice. "/>
			<outline text="Jobs will be the new CEO at Apple. I'd bet on it."/>
			<outline text="***A juicy story"/>
			<outline text="If this is the way it's going to go, Apple employees, Mac developers and users should read this San Jose Mercury article and decide if they want to invest in Jobs's Apple."/>
			<outline text="http://www.sjmercury.com/business/apple/jobs080997.htm "/>
			<outline text="No doubt this story presents the negative side of Jobs more strongly than the positive side. People who work at large companies don't like to have the cart turned over, and I agree with Jobs that big change is called for at Apple. He upsets some present and former Apple employees. Not surprising."/>
			<outline text="But if there's an element of truth in the Mercury story, Apple is headed for more confusion because that's what Jobs sells. Despite the euphoria on the cover of Time, a great story for Steve Jobs surely, but it's not a healthy situation for the Mac platform."/>

			<outline text="It's almost a week since the Microsoft-Apple deal was announced, it's on the cover of both Time and Newsweek, and the discussion on the web has settled down. "/>
			<outline text="The most steadfast Mac zealots have made their peace with the deal, they now include Bill Gates and his company under the sanctified umbrella, wearing the same halo they give to Guy Kawasaki and Steve Jobs (and used to give to Gil Amelio, as if to prove how flexible they can be)."/>
			<outline text="Others are putting up web pages comparing 1997 to 1984. The similarities are striking! A big guy on a big screen speaking above the crowd. Literature is great, but Orwell didn't know about the net or understand how technology could play a role in giving individuals a greater voice, not a diminished one."/>
			<outline text="The Mac press says this is an interesting deal, but what about the clones?"/>
			<outline text="***Why?"/>
			<outline text="So everybody wonders why they did it. What does it mean? How should we parse the deal? And then how do we move on? For some of us there's nothing new to digest. Microsoft isn't the death star that so many think they are. It's a large company with lots of personalities. Some very exciting and excitable people. It's got a corporate culture, for sure; a winning one -- we could all learn something from Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="I've said over and over that the animosity with Microsoft didn't serve the Mac community. The time to challenge Windows is long past, the time to move was 1990, seven years ago. Now that Windows is established, it's best to acknowledge and respect it, and find a place for the Mac to make a unique contribution. I've never doubted that the Mac could play such a role."/>
			<outline text="So I support Jobs's statement -- Microsoft doesn't have to lose in order for the Mac to win. Right on! Gotta agree with that one. Totally. The Mac is a great education and content platform. Woz would probably support the first, and I'm tuned into the latter. All bases are covered with that positioning statement. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;boyKillsBoy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="***Boy kills Boy"/>
			<outline text="So people ask why? I think the answer is obvious, but before looking at that, let's see why the software industry has so much trouble parsing deals like this one. "/>
			<outline text="I see articles in PC WEEK, InfoWorld, the business sections of local papers, the usual industry circuit; they seem to paint every industry story with the same colors. Every headline could read Boy Kills Boy! Or at least tries to. Next week the same story, except the boys are switched or different."/>
			<outline text="The competition is always so immature and unforgiving. Does Apple have a right to exist? Does the Mac? Not if Our Boy Bill kills them. Could Apple kill Microsoft? No. Therefore Apple is dead. Such logic! So immature. Does the world really work that way? No."/>
			<outline text="***Bigger picture, the high road"/>
			<outline text="As boys grow older and become men our view of the world changes. We learn that we are not the greatest primate in the jungle, that other people have greatness too. And if our youth was productive, we learn that we have a stake in the bigger picture. We learn to love the jungle, we want it to survive, we develop an appreciation for chaos."/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates is a leader, so is Steve Jobs. Bill runs Microsoft. Steve (apparently) runs Apple. But they play a larger role. Both are leaders of the software industry, and in that capacity they can act on a bigger level."/>
			<outline text="I can't speak for Gates, he hasn't said why he invested the money in Apple, but I'm going to assume that he took the high road, and explain what that means."/>
			<outline text="***What Mac users want"/>
			<outline text="It's really simple. There are millions of people who use Macs. Most of them want to continue to use the Mac. It costs so much time and lost creativity to change platforms. The goodwill of Mac users, as I've said many times, is worth a lot, longterm. Healing this situation is worth it, if you have a longterm view of the software business, which of course Gates does."/>
			<outline text="So if Mac users want to keep using Macs, why not let them? In one act, Gates sent a signal to the PC press -- stop undermining the Mac. Give it a chance. He led the best way you can -- by example. I'm giving them a chance, how about you too?"/>
			<outline text="Sun doesn't understand how the PC business works, or they would have jumped into this void. Same with Netscape. Luckily for both companies, Microsoft and Apple have left them an opening to do exactly that. I wonder if they're listening? If so, here's the formula."/>
			<outline text="***Think apps"/>
			<outline text="Jobs said a lot of things that are worthy of praise in his speech last Wednesday. He described an appalling situation. Photoshop sells a lot of Macs. But Apple has never made a Mac that's tuned to run Photoshop. Can we conclude that Adobe and Apple will work together to fix this? If so, Apple is playing in its strength. As a maker of both software and hardware, they're in a unique position to build this machine. Microsoft can't do it because they don't make hardware. And Compaq, Dell, Gateway can't do it because they don't make an OS. "/>
			<outline text="Jobs knows Warnock, but does he know Rich Siegel or Chuck Shotton? Has he ever put up a website with a Mac? Probably not. Has he ever written an AppleScript CGI? Does he have a clue where the Mac platform can go as a web content development system? I'd bet not. "/>
			<outline text="So there's the opening for Netscape. I've encouraged them, in the past, to take a stake in the Mac developer community. All of our software can be ported to other platforms. We're a culture, a community, a group of friends that like to work with each other. They could take the high road, as Microsoft has, and work to empower us, instead of shaking their heads (oh the Mac, it was so great...)"/>
			<outline text="***The hex can come off"/>
			<outline text="I was quoted in the Time article on the Microsoft-Apple deal saying &quot;Netscape could have shored up the Macintosh situation. Same with Sun. They could have given Apple $150 million. They weren't playing strategically. Microsoft was.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I regret saying that they could have given Apple $150 million. What I really want to say is that they could invest a few million in Mac net developers to help us be cross-platform or Java-compatible and relevant to the larger world. "/>
			<outline text="Either Sun or Netscape could help to take the industry hex off the Mac platform. Goodwill would accrue. Developers are important in this world. But so far, neither company has had a large enough view to take off the blinders and see what's been accomplished in this world. "/>

			<outline text="So what does baseball do? If Steve Jobs, the owner of one of the teams, were also the chairman of the board of baseball, he'd make a new rule -- only my team can play! And then he'd buy out all the other teams. (Would they get a good price?)"/>

			<outline text="When challenged by a larger market force, as with the IBM PC and its clones in the early 80s, and with Windows 3.0, 95 and then NT 4.0 in the 90s, they miss obvious marketing opportunities, ways to make their products stronger by participating in markets that others develop. This is an art that Microsoft has mastered, there's no reason Apple couldn't have learned the same lessons, but they didn't."/>
			<outline text="And when dealing with smaller competitors, Apple routinely and often unconsciously forced them out of business by bundling, or declaring that they will bundle a competitive offering. "/>
			<outline text="When the Internet happened, Apple struggled against it instead of embracing it, preferring to invest in technologies that eventually ended up on the scrap heap. A wasted lead in content development, developers going to Windows, a poor Java implementation on the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="The bottom line, the strategy of avoiding competition has been disastrous for Apple. But they want to do it again."/>
			<outline text="***The same old strategy"/>
			<outline text="The cloners, Motorola, Power Computing, UMAX, IBM and others, are poised to ship products that would take Apple out of the hardware business, because they're cheaper, faster, bigger, more powerful machines than Apple's new products. These are the computers that Mac users want and are, in my opinion, entitled to."/>
			<outline text="Even though we haven't seen the license agreements with the cloners, it appears that Apple has the contractual right to forbid them to ship the computers, for any reason at all. Apple wants to keep their hardware business, so they exercise that right."/>
			<outline text="I despise companies that use hardball tactics to put their competitors out of business. I admire companies that rise to competition. I happily buy new products when I have a choice. I don't like to buy products that I'm forced to buy."/>
			<outline text="***Is it a nice business?"/>
			<outline text="If you don't have anyone to compare with, if you aren't subject to customer choice, your product loses direction, you focus inward, and eventually (as now for Apple) your interests become out of synch with the interests of your customers."/>
			<outline text="Focus on that for a moment. A company whose interests are against their customers. Is that a nice business? Does it have much of a future? Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="***Is it legal?"/>
			<outline text="The customer's interest here is clearly served by competition. The usual benefits apply -- lower prices, more realistic configurations, more diversity."/>
			<outline text="Apple's complaint that the cloners weren't growing the market can be explained by Apple's licensing policy that kept them from making fundamentally different products than Apple."/>
			<outline text="Where's the cheap sub-notebook Mac? Where's the handheld Mac? The Mac built into the dashboard of my car? Apple wouldn't let the cloners make these products. "/>
			<outline text="Apple is an economic disaster area. They want Mac users to put all their eggs in Apple's crumbling basket. "/>
			<outline text="Do we have any rights as consumers here? "/>
			<outline text="Why isn't the government looking at this closely? "/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Amelio on Competition&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/26/97; 8:44:31 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Gil Amelio, amelio@apple.com, is the former CEO of Apple Computer."/>
			<outline text="As if in reply to my &quot;Apple Avoids Competition&quot;, 8/23/97, reading an interview with Amelio yesterday, I was struck by one thing -- he and I have reached the same conclusion at pretty much the same time. "/>
			<outline text="After years of struggling with Apple, after microanalyzing every skirmish, now the picture is clear. "/>
			<outline text="Apple has never learned the discipline of competition."/>
			<outline text="***Amelio on competition"/>
			<outline text="Here's a brief excerpt from the Amelio interview: &quot;Apple is not a competitor. Apple does not know how to compete. It knows how to innovate, but it doesn't know how to compete, and they're different. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;So you have a situation where you got the innovator here, you got the competitor here, and guess what? The competitor won that because, their things are great, but in the final analysis, if you can't compete, you can't make it attractive in the marketplace, you can't have people lusting after buying it, it doesn't matter.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="There was no coordination here. I haven't talked with or emailed with Amelio for months. I highly recommend reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macaddict.com/exclusive/giltalks.html&quot;&gt;full interview&lt;/a&gt;. Search for the word &quot;compete&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="***Tom Seaver"/>
			<outline text="Doing some baseball browsing, I looked up the official web page for Tom Seaver, the Mets pitching ace of the late 60s and early 70s. "/>
			<outline text="When it was time for Seaver to retire, in 1987, he said &quot;There were no more competitive pitches.&quot; He went on to say \&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.servtech.com/public/pnm/seaver/GERGEN.HTM&quot;&gt;My god, it's been a beautiful career&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="For him baseball was about being competitive. &quot;Win some lose some&quot; is a basic philosophy of sports and of business. You don't have to win every time. Even great hitters strike out more often than they hit home runs."/>
			<outline text="To me, competing is about going thru your fear of losing and realllly wanting to win."/>
			<outline text="***The disconnect with developers"/>
			<outline text="It's as if we're from different planets. We're always shouting at Apple &quot;Use us to win!&quot; And they don't understand what we're saying."/>
			<outline text="Where this goes depends on how well Apple's new board members are hearing. Developers can teach Apple about competition. The world we live in is unforgivingly competitive. Luckily for Apple, Ellison and Campbell both understand competing. "/>
			<outline text="***The message from developers"/>
			<outline text="Apple has always believed it must come up with all the messages. As a result they've missed the other side of the conversation. Apple directors could watch The Joy Luck Club and listen to the daughters and mothers struggling to be heard by each other. That's what it's been like in this world. Lots of talk, very little listen."/>
			<outline text="Every developer has a proposition for Apple, a deal they would love to do. That's the opportunity for System 9 -- find a way to incorporate the visions of Mac developers in the evolution of the platform. "/>
			<outline text="The easiest way to do this, of course, would be to free the OS and let anyone do anything with it they want. There may be smaller steps that would accomplish a similar result."/>
			<outline text="***The Mac's opportunity"/>
			<outline text="Viewed as something independent of Apple Computer, the opportunity for the Mac OS is very simply stated as a question -- How to compete in an operating system world dominated by Windows?"/>
			<outline text="Answer -- zig where they zag. Microsoft would be crazy to give away Windows. (They might do it, Microsoft is a very competitive company!) But there would be huge value in going first here. Could Apple's shareholders capture some portion of the value? As they say in Fargo, yoooo betcha!"/>
			<outline text="All it takes is courage to allow things to change and realign in different ways. Please read &quot;Programmers&quot;, 5/7/97, for some ideas on how to change."/>
			<outline text="***A non-Microsoft operating system"/>
			<outline text="The power of a non-Microsoft operating system with lots of apps has been bottled up forever behind a wall of fear. Letting go was good for Tom Seaver (it was realistic, he realized) and it would be good for the Mac OS to give up any pretense of having cash value, since it doesn't actually have very much of that as an Apple-owned thing."/>

			<outline text="Before Apple attacked, Power had the high ground, better products, their machine worked better, and so did the company. "/>
			<outline text="Power was a true competitor. Quality and performance at a good price, with a smile on their face. "/>
			<outline text="I wrote about Power Computing, fondly:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;geneva,arial&quot;&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Their T-shirts are incredible. A picture of a tough determined punkish little kid, an old-fashioned one, saying &quot;Let's Kick Intel's Butt!&quot; Yeah! Why not? They claim to have the fastest desktop computer in the world, a 225 megahertz MacOS system. I want one! They say &quot;We're fighting back for the Mac.&quot; Ye-hi! Me too."/>

			<outline text="See &quot;What If... What If!&quot;, 8/12/96, for more glowing praise."/>
			<outline text="***The story from the web"/>
			<outline text="The Mac is the most webbed platform out there. So many people who use Macs have websites, really good ones. There are over a dozen great sites devoted to all aspects of Macintosh gossip. I keep finding out about new ones."/>
			<outline text="So the story has been coming out this week, covered so thoroughly, and it's such an interesting story! So many back-channels and back-stabs, new ways for information to flow and blood too (at least corporate blood). "/>
			<outline text="One company is devastated at the hands of another. One company afraid. Another company brave. The attack comes. They have no cojones. They try to compromise with the fear and everyone quits."/>
			<outline text="***The story from inside"/>
			<outline text="From an unattributed Power Computing insider:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;geneva,arial&quot;&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Here's the story yet to be told of the boardroom stand-off between Joel Kocher and Steve Kahng before Joel's abrupt departure. "/>
			<outline text="As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/1997/35/b3542086.htm&quot;&gt;BusinessWeek article&lt;/a&gt; states, Power had hired a high-powered law firm to evaluate the Power case against Apple. Many, including Kocher and most of the executive staff, felt that Power had an air-tight case against Apple for breach of contract. "/>
			<outline text="Apple and Power's negotiations are very well documented in the S1 filing, as you've noticed."/>
			<outline text="So Joel wanted to fight Apple in court and in the media over their about-face on licensing. Kahng didn't want a protracted and expensive legal battle. "/>
			<outline text="Joel sealed up the support of the executive team and gave the board an ultimatum: fight Apple or we all leave. The board sided with Kahng, and Kocher, true to his word left, taking all but a handful of the executive staff with him."/>
			<outline text="So today at Power people are leaving in droves. So many levels of managers are gone that many are left wondering who they report to. "/>
			<outline text="And now at Power when people blame Steve for killing licensing, often they mean Steve Kahng, not Jobs, for his refusal to fight."/>
			<outline text="&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;"/>

			<outline text="What does this make me think of?"/>

			<outline text="As a software developer, building a base of users, I am interested in seeing the OS run in as many places at possible. I'm pretty radical about this. "/>
			<outline text="I've asked Apple to free the Mac OS, to let it live out its days not as a cash cow shackled to Apple's balance sheet, but to let it find as many desktops as possible; given the commodity that graphic OSes have become. "/>
			<outline text="I wish you could go to Fry's and buy all the pieces of a Mac for $600, including the ROMs and the OS. I wish anyone could be a cloner. It's in my business interests for the Mac OS to be as free as possible."/>

			<outline text="***Is it time to quit?"/>
			<outline text="We're working on Frontier 5. We're driving into an open space in the market, powerful cross-platform web scripting. It's very important that the software runs on both Mac and Windows. There are still lots of Quadras and 9500s out there, PowerBooks and Power Computing boxes that do a lot of web development and site hosting. We know the Mac users really well. Still getting our sea-legs on Windows. Being cross-platform is totally important for what we do."/>
			<outline text="We hope Apple can do something to steady the ride and make it possible for us to build a business selling software to Mac users. Regardless, even if we give away our Mac software forever, it's worth it for us to continue to invest in the Mac OS platform, even if Apple has brought a halt to cloning."/>
			<outline text="We've had to swallow our pride for business reasons many times over the years when dealing with Apple. Now is no different. The question is whether it makes business sense for us to be here. It still does."/>
			<outline text="Talking with a reporter yesterday, he expressed surprise at the low $100 million price Apple paid for Power Computing. I said that was no surprise to me. There are lots of bargains in the Mac market waiting for someone with a checkbook. Lots of power, lots of unique software. Cash-starved developers everywhere you look. Lots of bargains."/>
			<outline text="From my point of view it's silly to quibble about desktop OSes. Windows and Mac are pretty close in functionality. The differentiation is in the software that runs on the OSes. With the constant soap opera at Apple lots of diamonds have been passed over. I keep hoping things calm down, and some rational business deals can be cut to leverage the talent and software that's accumulated around the Mac OS."/>

No ads in the Wall Street Journal or New York Times. No messages on their website. No spin control. No one knows what to make of this."/>
			<outline text="Apple has no CEO. There is no responsibility. Who do you trust?"/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="***What's true?"/>
			<outline text="The truth is not what Apple has told us. The cloners had some truly exciting products in the pipe. These products will never come to market. That's not good for the Mac ecosystem. "/>
			<outline text="Apple says they have exciting new products too. Even if this is true, Apple has had reliability and forecasting problems. By eliminating second sources they exacerbate the problems. Apple also (this got little publicity) eliminated their quality control department in the last few weeks. They're playing a dangerous game with their customer's livelihoods."/>
			<outline text="***A price hike?"/>

			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail970904.html "/>
			<outline text="Rogovy's theory goes like this. Apple needs to raise prices. They can't do that as long as they have direct competitors who can undercut their price. So they chose to close down the cloners in order to be able to raise prices."/>
			<outline text="As I said, this is the most positive explanation I've heard. Other explantions are on today's Mail page. "/>
			<outline text="***Communication"/>
			<outline text="Apple has a long way to go before it regains customer trust. This is corporate America, not a platform, not a cause, not a religion. They want your money, but they don't want to talk to you or listen to you."/>
			<outline text="They won't miss my money. It won't get their attention, it won't make them talk to me as an adult would talk to another adult."/>
			<outline text="But I don't have to buy their products. And as a user, right now, that's what makes the most sense to me."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Trust also means &quot;an industrial or business combination, now illegal in the U.S., in which management and control of the member corporations are invested in a single board of trustees, who are thus able to control a market, absorb or eliminate competition, fix prices, etc.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="&quot;What goes around comes around. Apple hosed Be in the next generation O/S licensing talks and now Be's in a position to return the favor. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;It started this afternoon and I predict an avalanche by tomorrow. Everyone is figuring out how Be and the clone manufacturers can put together a platform to work around Apple's monopoly. And it is an appealing vision. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;I hope Jean-Louis spends one of his remaining nine corporate lives on making this happen. I can tell you that if Metrowerks targets Latitude to the Be OS, I'll recompile every piece of Mac source code I have to the Be platform. Long before it goes to Rhapsody.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="***Doc Explains Steve Jobs"/>
			<outline text="Another friend , Doc Searls, searls@batnet.com, wrote a much longer piece about Steve Jobs. I think he called it just right. You have to read the whole thing. "/>

			<outline text="Doc nails it. He put it in place for me. There isn't very much room around Jobs. That's what happened to Power Computing, and the other cloners."/>
			<outline text="I'm a big guy. Chuck wants a place to play. Windows will be fun for sure, but we just want a playground that isn't crowded by Jobs or Microsoft."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What's Up Doc?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/7/97; 7:51:03 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="In the rush of events of last week my friend Doc Searls wrote an eye-opening piece on Steve Jobs and Apple. A lot of people read this piece on the Scripting News website, but it never went out to DaveNet mailboxes. I wanted to get it on the record and let this story influence other news writers and analysts who read DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="Doc's piece is an extrapolation based on experience. He's been an Apple user and observer for many years. He has a sense of art and literature, which is important when understanding how Steve Jobs approaches the world. "/>
			<outline text="It's a tea-leaves read. Doc tells us things about Apple and Jobs that they have not directly told us. But for people who have invested careers and money alongside Apple, such as cloners, developers and users, all we have is tea leaves to read. The press releases, white papers and websites haven't been coming from Apple. They haven't told us how to parse their plan. So we do the best we can."/>
			<outline text="Also, it's very unusual that we make an issue of a single personality in DaveNet, but it's justified here because Jobs's personality is a big issue. It's right in the middle of Apple's strategy. Maybe Doc has it all wrong -- but I read it the same way he does. "/>
			<outline text="Where is Apple going? Here's what Doc Searls says..."/>
			<outline text="***Doc Searls on Steve Jobs"/>
			<outline text="So Steve Jobs just shot the cloners in the head, indirectly doing the same to the growing percentage of Mac users who preferred cloned Mac systems to Apple's own.  So his message to everybody was no different than it was at Day One:  all I want from the rest of you is your money and your appreciation for my Art."/>
			<outline text="It was a nasty move, but bless his ass. Steve's art has always been first class, and priced accordingly.  There was nothing ordinary about it.  The Mac &quot;ecosystem&quot; Steve talks about is one that rises from that Art, not from market demand or other more obvious forces.  And that art has no more to do with developers, customers and users than Van Gogh's has to do with Sotheby's, Christie's and art collectors."/>
			<outline text="See, Steve is an elitist and an innovator, and damn good at both.  His greatest achievements are novel works of beauty and style.  The Apple I and II were Works of Woz; but Lisa, Macintosh, NeXT and Pixar were all Works of Jobs.  Regardless of their market impact (which in the cases of Lisa and NeXT were disappointing), all four were remarkable artistic achievements. They were also inventions intended to mother necessity -- and reasonably so.  That's how all radical innovations work.  "/>
			<outline text="Less forward marketers, including Bill Gates, wait for necessity to mother invention, and the best of those invent and implement beautifully, even though that beauty is rarely appreciated."/>
			<outline text="To Steve, clones are the drag of the ordinary on the innovative.  All that crap about cloners not sharing the cost of R&amp;D is just rationalization. Steve puts enormous value on the engines of innovation. Killing off the cloners just eliminates a drag on his own R&amp;D, as well as a way to reposition Apple as something closer to what he would have made the company if he had been in charge through the intervening years."/>
			<outline text="The simple fact is that Apple always was Steve's company, even when he wasn't there.  The force that allowed Apple to survive more than a decade of bad leadership, cluelessness and constant mistakes was the legacy of Steve's original Art.  That legacy was not just an OS that was 10 years ahead of the rest of the world, but a Cause that induced a righteousness of purpose centered around a will to innovate -- to perpetuate the original artistic achievements.  And in Steve's absence Apple did some righeous innovation too.  Eventually, though, the flywheels lost mass and the engine wore out."/>
			<outline text="In the end, by when too many of the innovative spirts first animated by Steve had moved on to WebTV and Microsoft, all that remained was that righteousness, and Apple looked and worked like what it was:  a church wracked by petty politics and a pointless yet deeply felt spirituality."/>
			<outline text="Now Steve is back, and gradually renovating his old company.  He'll do it his way, and it will once again express his Art."/>
			<outline text="These things I can guarantee about whatever Apple makes from this point forward:"/>
			<outline text="1. It will be original."/>
			<outline text="2. It will be innovative."/>
			<outline text="3. It will be exclusive."/>
			<outline text="4. It will be expensive."/>
			<outline text="5. It's aesthetics will be impeccable."/>
			<outline text="6. The influence of developers, even influential developers, will be minimal.  The influence of customers and users will be held in even higher contempt."/>
			<outline text="7. The influence of fellow business artisans such as Larry Ellison (and even Larry's nemesis, Bill Gates) will be significant, though secondary at best to Steve's own muse."/>
			<outline text="But will it succeed?  Depends on how much Steve's own energies are divided, and the speed at which the infrastructures for componentized computing emerge.  "/>
			<outline text="Steve must be coming to terms with the first.  I don't see anybody coming to terms with the second, including the Java community, which is still more an anti-Microsoft cartel than a real force in the marketplace."/>
			<outline text="Should be interesting."/>
			<outline text="***Thanks Doc!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.batnet.com/searls/docprsnl.html&quot;&gt;Doc's personal page&lt;/a&gt;, but it links to all his essays and his business site.

			<outline text="The best stuff!"/>
			<outline text="***I compete with Bill Gates!"/>
			<outline text="On September 30 I'll be running a live session at the Seybold Conference in San Francisco. It's free and open to the public. "/>
			<outline text="There's a twist to this session. Soon after announcing it I learned that Microsoft is having a party at the same time in SF to celebrate the shipment of MSIE 4.0/Win. Bill Gates will be there! Wow. I would have enjoyed being at his show. "/>
			<outline text="I imagined an empty DaveNet hall. Me with mike, and a smattering of enthusiasts. I imagined that all the cooool people would be at Microsoft's party."/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm. Then I realized there are probably a few really interesting people who won't be invited to the Microsoft bash, who would like to get some airtime at the same time as Gates. Let's fill the house with people who compete with Microsoft! What a trip. There's strength in numbers."/>
			<outline text="So, a message to smart PR people everywhere, here's your chance to get your visionaries on the record. I'm dealing. Microsoft is making Seybold an industry venue this year. I like that. We have space available at DaveNet. Send email to dave@scripting.com. "/>

			<outline text="New Orleans is romantic too, especially in October, when the threat of hurricanes is still there. It could be a preview of the El Nio effect we'll be having in California this winter. Anyway I ramble..."/>
			<outline text="October 13-15 in New Orleans I'm leading three opening sessions at c|net's Web Builder conference. My job is to get the audience involved. To lead a discussion that's much like the one we'll do in San Francisco, except this one is for web geeks, gals and guys, people who make their living doing the technical work of running large interesting websites."/>
			<outline text="The twist this time is that I'll do the same session three times on three days. So the discussion can extend over several days, and thru all the conference sessions. "/>
			<outline text="I also love New Orleans, any time of year. I lived there for three years in the 70s, graduating from Tulane (math major) in 1976. It'll be like a homecoming for me."/>

			<outline text="***Being respectful"/>
			<outline text="The best way to be heard is to speak with respect. Take the high road."/>
			<outline text="Please assume everyone is well-intentioned and smart. "/>
			<outline text="If you don't know what respect is, take a deep breath, and call a friend and listen to carefully and really hear them. The more you don't want to hear from the person, the deeper the respect you will experience. "/>
			<outline text="No one is wrong, ever. When you think otherwise, imagine what it's like to be the other person. Then ask a straight question, with no agenda, no expected answer. And listen."/>

			<outline text="***Ric Ford"/>

			<outline text="http://www.macintouch.com/openletter.html "/>
			<outline text="Imagine someone did this to you. That's what I did. I wouldn't have liked it. If I were perfect I just would have ignored it. No one is perfect in that way. "/>
			<outline text="I also told Ric that I'm totally committed to his MacInTouch service. "/>

			<outline text="It's the web at its best. Ric is a great guy."/>
			<outline text="***How to win"/>
			<outline text="If you create some space for Apple and Jobs, they might surprise you. I'm not saying that they *will*, but if you don't leave space, they can't overcome your expectations. "/>

			<outline text="Goood morning!"/>
			<outline text="Listening to Bonnie. No she ain't no Queen of Sheeba. Hmmm. We can choose, you know we ain't no amoeba! What a rhymer. What a cutie! I love Bonnie. Yes. That cry of love is so alarming! Love -- what a powerful thing. She's a three time loser. Bonnie has music for all the moods. "/>
			<outline text="If you get a chance, see her live. If not, get her Road Tested CD for a taste of Bonnie live. It's cool. You don't know which Bonnie I'm talking about? Immediately, stop reading this email and get a life! Right now."/>
			<outline text="Yeah."/>
			<outline text="***The perfect parent"/>
			<outline text="I have a friend, a man, who's going thru a hugely painful process. A long marriage. Divorce. Lots of stuff comes up. Old wounds open. Pain and confusion. I've been there myself. It all comes back. Oh man!"/>
			<outline text="At times like this it can be really hard to be positive. But when the wounds are open, they have a chance to heal; if you really go into it, and fully experience what's happening. After a long dysfunctional relationship ends, there's huge pain, but you get a chance to redesign your life. "/>
			<outline text="It's like a wakeup call in the middle of the night. You're groggy and upset. I just want to go back to sleep! But the pain is so great that you can't sleep. It's time to wake up. Like it or not. "/>
			<outline text="When a big tree falls it creates space for new life. But you really miss the old tree, the old way of life, and all the bandages that it gave you. "/>
			<outline text="Sometimes I think we're all searching the planet for the perfect parent, the replacement for the ones that let us down. That's probably the biggest pain we feel when a relationship ends. Where's my mom! Who's going to take care of me now?"/>
			<outline text="The answer -- inside each of us is the perfect parent, the one we never had. You can give that to yourself, just like you give it to your kids. I can take my boy on trips. Show him neat things. And make promises to him, develop his trust. At times he doesn't trust the adult Dave. Acknowledge that. It's OK. Promise to try to do better. Really mean it. When I can do this I really feel free and happy. I'm not kidding, that's really what it takes."/>
			<outline text="Little boys are very forgiving people. All they really need to know is that you care about them, and are doing your best. You don't have to *always* protect them, they don't want that, and will struggle against it. It's cool because that's how I express my creativity. But the little boy inside me needs to know that when he goes on an adventure, he can always come home for acceptance and good home cooking. I never want to be very far away from home."/>
			<outline text="So, I am both a little boy and a big man. I am a source of caring and protecting and giving. I can be responsible, which means I will respond if a situation calls for a response. But I also like to have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***Voices"/>
			<outline text="There are actually lots of voices inside each of us, but we're discouraged from seeing this by the way we were brought up. I have a voice inside me that's my father. I need to challenge this voice. "/>
			<outline text="Something bad happens. He yells at me. I say firmly, respectfully, sometimes even aloud, &quot;No, Dave is not an idiot. He's a very smart person, and I love him very much, and I'd like you to stop saying that.&quot; After practicing this dialog for a couple of years my father's voice has become more loving. It turns out that the parent inside me can learn and let go of his pain instead of giving it to the little boy."/>
			<outline text="A disrespectful voice coming from inside. We are not single consistent entities. Each of us is actually a community! But we get to create the rules for this community. I find that the most important rule is that we treat each other with respect. It's OK to disagree, but be respectful about it."/>
			<outline text="***Voice dialog"/>
			<outline text="This sense of a person as a community is part of a new exploration in psychology called voice dialog. Often people who practice voice dialog call themselves hypnotherapists; a lot of people think that's about going to sleep when in fact it's about waking up. "/>
			<outline text="Many of us have been in a trance ever since something happened, as a kid, that was too much to handle. You gave up on something, realized your parents were selfish beings, not good protectors. You couldn't trust them and you needed to trust them because you were just a little boy or girl."/>
			<outline text="Now we are adults, and are responsible for caring for ourselves. We have to look inside to find the good parent, not outside. Once this happens, you can't be lonely anymore. You have great company, all those voices can be your friends! "/>
			<outline text="You can empower them selectively, as appropriate, according to circumstance. If it's safe, go for it, be a kid, have fun! If it's dangerous, let the kid rest, the adult responds. Often we look to other adults to provide safety, and later are disappointed and hurt when they let us down."/>
			<outline text="All this came up for me by sharing the experience of a divorce with a friend. I found I wanted to send him a message -- you are not alone in the world. I am your friend. Look into my eyes. I'm here."/>
			<outline text="I think that's another common theme. We're all searching the planet for proof that there are other beings. If you just open your eyes, have the courage to make eye contact, you'll see them. "/>
			<outline text="Everywhere!"/>
			<outline text="***Email with Nagel"/>
			<outline text="Last week (this was written in April 1996), when my Macintosh sea legs were still shaky from a system software catastrophe, I got an email from a top Apple exec, Dave Nagel (he's at AT&amp;T now) that asked why Apple should work with me when I'm so critical of Apple in DaveNet. Good question! "/>
			<outline text="Apple should work with me because with my software you can tie together the leading Macintosh Internet applications into a customizable suite of client, content development and server solutions. "/>
			<outline text="We could lead the market together, Dave, instead of waiting for all these apps to work with OpenDoc (that's what Apple was pushing in 1996). We can deliver the benefits of customizable integration right now."/>
			<outline text="***Hypercard &amp; Gasse"/>
			<outline text="A bunch of years ago I complained to one of your predecessors, Jean-Louis Gasse, that Apple was investing too much in HyperCard, that it wasn't the right longterm answer for Apple or developers or users. I was in the middle of developing Frontier, which embraced the Macintosh operating system, instead of trying to replace it, as HyperCard did. I felt it was a strategic mistake to split the operating system into two parts -- the desktop interface on one side, and HyperCardLand on the other side. They were so damned different!"/>
			<outline text="Gasse asked me the kind of question that a business person, concerned about meeting payroll and making numbers, would ask. Would I mind if they sold HyperCard until I got my software ready? I couldn't argue with this! It made me feel respected, and I understood that I was doing what I had decried -- I was FUDing a product that had delivered, with my promises of a much better land -- someday. HyperCard may have been ill-conceived. But it was shipping and people were liking it."/>
			<outline text="Gasse was right to say no to me, then, as it would be right for Apple to say no to OpenDoc now. It's hogging all your attention. You have put all your hopes on it. But, at best, it's years away from delivery. "/>
			<outline text="I can hear you objecting right now! No, you're saying, OpenDoc will be ready for end users in August. But how long before OpenDoc is something users will want? It isn't about menus and windows and code. A lot of things have to happen before it's a platform. And it's very, very far from a sure thing. Most proposed platforms don't make it. It's just a fact. It's not my fault. It's not yours."/>
			<outline text="***Entertainment"/>
			<outline text="Gasse had a sense of keeping the users entertained. He got it. Keep them coming back for new goodies. And maybe a breakthru. For that you need lots of risk-taking developers. That's how you get winners, not by hiring researchers to invent miracles for you. I'm sure he did his share of hiring, he's a good guy, but not perfect, but there was an important lesson. Don't be picky about where your software comes from. Promote what you got."/>
			<outline text="And it really is an either-or thing, developers can't compete with the platform vendor, no matter how well-intentioned the PV is. You have to leave well marked voids in the market, places where you won't play, to create markets. Apple did the opposite, invading competitive markets with void-creating white papers. "/>
			<outline text="OK."/>
			<outline text="***Let's get constructive"/>
			<outline text="Here's a new direction. Assume there are 20 million Macintosh users. Assume that one tenth of them are already on the net. Let's offer them something better. Assume that half of them want to get on the net. Let's make it easy for them. If we can give them software that makes a Mac user ten times more effective on the net than their Windows and Unix counterparts, why shouldn't we? "/>
			<outline text="Apple has always promoted the Mac as easy to use. My claim: that may have worked in the past, but we lose now if you sell Macintosh as the easy to use platform, because that negates the power of the platform. The power comes from its depth and maturity. And the profits come from longtime users who want to do new things. "/>
			<outline text="You have to catch users when they're busy inventing. Right now they're working on getting on the web as readers and writers and servers. Things that help them do that will make sense to them. Other things will seem like diversions."/>
			<outline text="Fact: all the Internet apps support the System 7 scripting standards. That technology must be commercialized before it can be used by lots of users. Commercialization. An important concept. It doesn't end with delivery. We never completed the task of commercializing System 7. Let's finish the job, and then turn it over to the developers and users."/>
			<outline text="***Criticism"/>
			<outline text="By the way, the only reason I criticize Apple is because I care about the platform, and I care about the script writing community, and I care about my software, and I care about me! "/>
			<outline text="The day that I stop criticizing Apple, you can assume it's because I've become a Windows developer or a Be developer, or have chosen to go sailing around the world, or to make pottery. "/>
			<outline text="I am not a quiet person. If I'm in a room, it's likely that you'll know I'm there."/>

			<outline text="Steve Jobs comes up with great marketing slogans."/>
			<outline text="Back in the heyday of the Apple II, he touted personal computers as the equivalent of fractional-horsepower motors. In the industrial age you had big motors to power steamships and railroads, and small motors to drive lawnmowers and to accurately position antennas. Jobs reasoned that if it made sense to scale motors down, it would also make sense to scale down computers."/>
			<outline text="Short term, it was a great idea. Of course personal computers boomed, but over time they became much more powerful than the factory-sized computers they replaced. The computer on my desktop today is vastly more powerful than the mainframe computer I learned to program on in the 1970s."/>
			<outline text="So computers got small and then got big."/>
			<outline text="The same thing can happen with web servers."/>
			<outline text="***My scanner"/>
			<outline text="Last week I bought a really cheap scanner. I can't get the damned thing to work. It plugs into the SCSI chain on my computer, but it's very picky -- it has to be the first one. After rearranging things I finally got the computer to recognize the scanner and all my older devices. "/>
			<outline text="That was just the beginning. I needed to install several layers of software, and I have no idea what they all do, or how to use them. I poked and poked, got the scanner to turn on, but after several hours of fussing with it, I still haven't gotten any GIFs on my desktop."/>
			<outline text="***What if?"/>
			<outline text="Then it hit me that scanners could be much simpler if you made them just a little more complex."/>
			<outline text="I'd like to buy a scanner that has a standard Ethernet jack on its back, just like the one that plugs into the Ethernet hub in my office. I'd plug this new scanner into the wall, for power, and then plug it into my hub for connections. Run a bit of software (off a floppy please!) that allows me to set the TCP address for the scanner from a Mac or a Wintel box."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/15/97; 6:55:45 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Last week I went to Microsoft's Foster City office for a demo of a new Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 feature: Scriptlets. "/>
			<outline text="To understand Scriptlets, first you have to understand how Java applets work in a web browser such as Netscape Navigator or MSIE."/>
			<outline text="***Java in web browsers"/>
			<outline text="Here's an example from JavaSoft's website:"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;applet codebase=&quot;java.sun.com/applets/NervousText/1.1&quot; code=&quot;NervousText.class&quot; width=400 height=75&gt;&amp;lt;param name=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;Whistle While You Work&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;This feature requires Java.&amp;lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;/applet&gt;"/>
			<outline text="When this code appears in a web page, you'll see a jiggling slogan in a rectangle that's 400 pixels wide and 75 pixels high."/>
			<outline text="There's a piece of software, written in Java, called NervousText.class on a server at Sun. This program is loaded into your machine and it runs. The web page tells it what text to jiggle. That bit of information is called a parameter."/>
			<outline text="Code that takes parameters and displays something in a box. This is how the web browsers from Netscape and Microsoft load Java code from a server and run it on a client. "/>
			<outline text="***Scriptlets -- same thing for scripts"/>
			<outline text="Today Microsoft has released a spec that, when implemented in MSIE, will allow scripts to have exactly the same power as Java."/>
			<outline text="A familiar pattern:"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;object id=&quot;Calendar&quot; width=400 height=270 type=&quot;text/x-scriptlet&quot; data=&quot;Calendar.htm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;This feature requires MSIE 4.0.&amp;lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;/object&gt;"/>
			<outline text="When this code appears in a web page, you'll see a calendar in a rectangle that's 400 pixels wide and 270 pixels high. You can move a cursor thru the calendar and change some of the colors used to display the calendar. "/>
			<outline text="It's just a demo, as the Java text jiggler is."/>
			<outline text="***Details"/>
			<outline text="I've posted details on the www.scripting.com website, including a Microsoft-supplied sample scriptlet and a page that builds on the scriptlet."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/specials/scriptlets/ "/>
			<outline text="It's deep and powerful and mysterious. I'm not kidding!"/>
			<outline text="***Scripting"/>
			<outline text="What makes scripting different than programming? It's higher level. The verbs do more. There's usually a database close by. The developer tools are easier and more highly leveraged and in some cases more complete than than those for Java."/>
			<outline text="Java is lower-level, like C or Pascal. Scripting languages like JavaScript, tcl, PERL, AppleScript and our own UserTalk have powerful syntax, comparable to Java. The simplicity of scripting is in the power of the environment and the leverage of the development tools."/>
			<outline text="***A chance to dig"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is opening a door, allowing equal access to script writers. We've asked Java to work with us, but they've stayed closed. As often is the case, we never asked Microsoft, and they come knocking on the door. And it's a challenge, of course. We understand that they make scripting software too. "/>
			<outline text="To my company, UserLand, it means that Frontier's object database, native verb set, development tools, and threaded runtime can now be applied to web content on the client side. It'll make smart scriptable sandboxes possible. We've been ready for this since last spring. We get a chance now to dig in this direction."/>
			<outline text="Thanks Microsoft. We're still going to focus on the content development side, but it'll be interesting to experiment with this new client-side functionality. "/>
			<outline text="We also think it'll be important for our users, people who develop Intranet and publishing applications. There's no doubt that Scriplets change the economics and structure of application development for the net."/>
			<outline text="***What's next?"/>
			<outline text="Now, more than ever, I want vector graphics in the web browser."/>
			<outline text="I wrote about this in &quot;LineTo MoveTo&quot;, 6/24/97."/>

			<outline text="One more story (a brief one) before I head off to Crested Butte and the Digital Storytelling conference. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.dstory.com/ "/>
			<outline text="I expect to totally be blown away by the beauty. We're going to tell some great stories. Let's start now."/>
			<outline text="***Wedding vows"/>
			<outline text="From www.bible.org, a beautiful statement of love and commitment. "/>
			<outline text="I take you to be my wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish till death do us part."/>
			<outline text="***To the court"/>
			<outline text="I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."/>
			<outline text="***What about kids?"/>
			<outline text="We pledge our commitment to each other and to our government, but what about kids? "/>
			<outline text="What if there were a ceremony on the birth of a child, in which the parent pledged, in spoken and written words, to love, honor and respect the child, in sickness and in health, till death do us part?"/>
			<outline text="Why don't we do this? Even if the vows were broken, as they so often are, at least the children would know they deserve love and respect. It would never be a question for kids to struggle with. So many kids don't know that they were born with the right to be heard. We could fix that."/>
			<outline text="It's never too late to tell your children that you love them and to commit to listening to them and really hearing. And commit to telling the truth."/>
			<outline text="And in speaking and writing these words to our children, we have the opportunity to heal the wounds given to us by our parents. "/>
			<outline text="Perhaps if more adults understood that children require commitment, they wouldn't be so casual about having them."/>
			<outline text="Children owe their parents nothing other than being who they are. Parents owe children so much more -- protection, nurturing, feeding, support, encouragement. "/>
			<outline text="So many parents, when their children are born, are still children themselves, and try to flip the equation around and get the support and nurturing from their children that their parents didn't give them. This is wrong! At birth, the child is a screaming, cold, love-seeking being. It can give nothing but his or her presence."/>
			<outline text="As the child grows she can give more of herself. She can create. She can discover and learn. But the only gift the child can give is herself. To ask more from the child is to lose the child."/>
			<outline text="***A new set of vows"/>
			<outline text="So I propose a new set of vows, from parent to child, on the birth of the child."/>
			<outline text="I promise to love, honor and respect you. To protect you from harm, to feed you well. To teach you to live in this world, to the best of my ability. To always speak the truth, directly, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. "/>
			<outline text="I promise to listen to you. I acknowledge that you're a separate being from me who the universe has trusted me to care for. I didn't create you any more than you created me. "/>
			<outline text="I forgive you now, and always, unconditionally."/>
			<outline text="You are my son (or daughter). You are not me, you are not my mother or father, you are not who I think you are. I expect to be surprised! "/>
			<outline text="I celebrate your existence every day of my life, with my entire being. "/>
			<outline text="What a great adventure we're sharing."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***Lennon"/>
			<outline text="John Lennon wrote a great song about fatherhood, Beautiful Boy. "/>
			<outline text="To his son, he said &quot;Before you cross the street, take my hand.&quot; He promises to be with his child on his trip thru life. That's what it's all about. "/>
			<outline text="So many variations are possible! "/>

			<outline text="When I first heard Digital Storytelling I heard Internet Storytelling. That's what I do. The festival turns out to be something else -- many of the people who go are doing multi-year projects to bring movie-like storytelling to computer screens using tools like Adobe Premiere and Macromedia Director."/>

			<outline text="Hey we took a trip to the top of the mountain, but we stayed in the auditorium. Movies! Yeah. We went to ancient San Francisco and to photo vaults in the midwest. We we went deep into the imaginations of some incredible artists. They invoke our imaginations. That's art."/>

			<outline text="***Microserfs"/>
			<outline text="I read Douglas Coupland's Microserfs in the evenings and early mornings in Crested Butte. What a great book! The best part -- a new application for Vladimir Ilich Lenin, who's now an embalmed corpse lying in state in Moscow. I laughed out loud when I read that part. "/>
			<outline text="Microserfs is a beautiful book of friendship and love and confusion set in Redmond, Palo Alto and Las Vegas and in the board rooms of Sand Hill Road. Everyone in the software industry should read this book. Oh man. I wish I had written it. It has already added color to my life. Lots! I feel like I'm living in Microserfs. I bet you will too."/>

			<outline text="Next week, the Seybold Conference in San Francisco. "/>
			<outline text="The publishing world meets the world of computer technology. "/>
			<outline text="Organizations that create magazines, books, advertising and now websites. "/>
			<outline text="Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and John Warnock are the announced keynoters. Microsoft will roll out MSIE 4.0 at the show. "/>
			<outline text="Seybold is a big, historically significant venue. Macs are dominant among the Seybold crowd. It's very important that Jobs is speaking. It's been a long time since a person of Jobs's stature and confidence has spoken on behalf of Apple at Seybold. "/>
			<outline text="Attention from Apple, especially if it comes with listening, is much needed. If Jobs were to miss it, he loses, but his customers lose too. That's where the Seybold people are coming from. They don't want Mac users to lose. That's where the interests are aligned and that's why the CEO of Apple should be there, to speak, to listen, to win."/>
			<outline text="***Cornelius Willis"/>
			<outline text="On Tuesday night at 7:30PM at Moscone we're doing a DaveNet Live session. There was a problem with the timing, we resolved it. The session coincides with the Microsoft rollout event for MSIE. I wrote about this in &quot;Competing with Bill&quot;, 9/9/97."/>
			<outline text="As I imagined they would, the Microsoft people have risen to the challenge, and even though Bill Gates won't be present (he sent me email saying he wished he could be) we will have an exciting and opinionated Microsoft rep at the event, Cornelius Willis. "/>
			<outline text="I appreciate this, no doubt he wanted to be at the Microsoft launch event. Pam Kahle of Waggoner-Edstrom, Microsoft's PR firm, kept me insulated from what was a difficult situation among Microsoft execs, and I'm totally pleased with the outcome. "/>
			<outline text="I will help Willis state his point of view, and of course will encourage others to speak, respectfully, in opposition. I think Willis is a perfect choice for a DaveNet event because he speaks so clearly. The Microsoft point of view that he states is unabashed and direct."/>
			<outline text="That's what I'm into. Exposing ideas, helping people think for themselves, not being fearful of opposing or dissonant viewpoints."/>
			<outline text="***Everyone is welcome!"/>
			<outline text="We know Microsoft will be represented on Tuesday. I hope people from Adobe, Apple, Be, Netscape, Quark, Sun, the development community, and people from the publishing world will be there."/>
			<outline text="Everyone is welcome at DaveNet! When we open the door, we open it wide. We don't control what people say, but we insist they they speak for themselves only, concisely, and don't attempt to invalidate any point of view. There's no support for censorship here. Free speech may not be the rule everywhere, but when it's a DaveNet stage, it's totally the rule."/>
			<outline text="We'll do some puzzles! "/>
			<outline text="See what we can learn, look for ways to work with each other. "/>
			<outline text="And I'll talk a bit about where I see my world going."/>
			<outline text="***I'm confident"/>
			<outline text="For Mac publishing users right now, the key feature is safety, a path forward, solid ground over the horizon. It's been a rough road. I expect to hear a lot of that next week at Seybold. As a user, I want to be able to invest in Mac systems, knowing that it's going to get easier and easier to switch to Windows if the switch becomes necessary."/>
			<outline text="I've tried to align my software with the interests of people who run publishing operations based on Macs. In mid-1996 I made the decision that a Mac strategy without a Windows fallback was hopeless. So we got busy porting. Now the payoff is pretty close to reality. "/>
			<outline text="I feel confident about the bet we made last year. I didn't know Steve Jobs was coming back to run Apple. I didn't know that NextStep would become an Apple OS. I didn't know that Apple would kill licensing and put a regulator on performance enhancements to the Mac platform."/>
			<outline text="But I did see that Apple was not tuning in to what was working in the Mac Internet apps market; and as I've learned, when Apple tunes out, chaos is the result. And in that, my bet was right on the money."/>
			<outline text="Steve Jobs and I are in agreement on one important thing -- Apple has been a strategic disaster area for the last ten years. We may or may not agree about how to go forward. There's been very little communication. I hope to improve on that."/>
			<outline text="***Where do I want to go?"/>
			<outline text="We're a few weeks from delivering the first public alphas of Frontier 5 for Windows. We'll release the Mac software first, probably later this week or early next week. I plan to briefly demo Frontier 5/Win at the DaveNet event on Tuesday."/>
			<outline text="Frontier 5 is cross-platform, so any software that runs in our environment has an automatic transition path to Windows. Websites that build on the Mac will build on Windows with minor modifications (file path syntax is different on Windows, but even there we have a cross-platform alternate syntax, file URL strings)."/>
			<outline text="Both versions support TCP apps. You can write daemons and clients that run in the Frontier environment and are cross-platform, running on both the Mac OS and Windows. When performance permits, we'll promote Frontier as a cross-platform platform for building Internet apps. Eventually we'll get the performance equation right. We need this functionality to make our editorial workflow software work cross-platform."/>
			<outline text="***WebSTAR Day"/>
			<outline text="Shifting gears, yesterday was WebSTAR Day on Scripting News."/>
			<outline text="I chose this day to focus on WebSTAR because the first official word on Apple's network computer strategy had been spoken, at the Oracle conference in Los Angeles."/>
			<outline text="Now the tea leaves are in the open. I thought I understood where Apple was going, and the reports confirmed that my understanding was (mostly) correct."/>
			<outline text="The key message: Mac OS for the client, and Rhapsody for the server."/>
			<outline text="OK, so what do I think of this?"/>
			<outline text="***Nature abhors a vacuum"/>
			<outline text="I think that an Apple/Oracle alliance has a lot of potential. "/>
			<outline text="Oracle is a vast and effective sales force, lots of customers and profits, and probably a lot of influence over what kind of server systems their customers install. I don't understand their market, but I see profits and growth; and that's a sure sign of power. "/>
			<outline text="But they leave behind them, in the wake, a large group of powerful users and developers, people who built around the Macintosh OS as a server operating system. I know, we weren't supposed to do this, according to the Unix geeks it's not possible. But that didn't stop some talented people from doing it anyway."/>
			<outline text="Nature abhors a vacuum. People had old Macs lying around. They wanted to run web servers on them when the web server market was booming and Apple was asleep at the wheel on the Internet. Ask former Apple CEOs Gil Amelio or Mike Spindler to talk about the server market to see what I mean."/>
			<outline text="Various efforts to quantify the size of this market all say one thing, it's large. There are lots of Mac OS servers out there. Makes sense. Shops that do production work on Macs tend to have a bunch of Macs lying around. The system managers are comfortable with the Mac file system and utility apps. "/>
			<outline text="If you asked for a show of hands at Seybold, I bet lots of publishing organizations are running Mac web servers. You use what you have. A strength in content translates into a strength in servers. Unix geeks may feel they'd be better off with Apache, but these people chose WebSTAR or a WebSTAR-compatible server."/>
			<outline text="These are powerful people. Publishers with full-time net connections. I covet them as users! Who wouldn't?"/>
			<outline text="The message from Apple is that people who run Mac web servers should transition to Rhapsody. I wouldn't do this if I were Apple because it creates a vacuum, a transition point. When you tell a user it's time to switch, they might not go where you want them to. It works better if you keep them supplied with new features and bug fixes. As they say in mainframe circles, keep it simple. Right on."/>
			<outline text="***I run three Mac OS servers"/>
			<outline text="At UserLand we have three Mac web servers and one Windows NT server. "/>
			<outline text="All of the Macs run System 7. We almost never rip up the wires and start over with a new server. Once it's running and debugged, I want to move forward not backward. "/>
			<outline text="I'm interested in well-tested enhancements to these servers. I don't even want to install System 8 on these machines. I'm a busy guy. I like servers that work. I hate it when things stop working and users are hitting the site and we're not responding."/>
			<outline text="***OracleWare"/>
			<outline text="I'm interested in commerce systems. "/>
			<outline text="I'd like my ISP to run Rhapsody and WebObjects software, if it's the best way to go."/>
			<outline text="Maybe Apple can set up a server to sell my software? I'd be happy to share revenue they can generate this way. "/>
			<outline text="But I really don't think I'm going to learn OracleWare, or invest in developing for it. I think we have our hands full with our ContentWare."/>
			<outline text="***Improving the Mac OS"/>
			<outline text="OK, I've asked Apple to free the Mac OS. Clearly that isn't happening. Let's incorporate Apple ownership into the plan and go on from there."/>
			<outline text="There are encouraging sounds coming from Apple on the Mac OS. I heard an Apple person say that they're refitting the Copland kernel into the Mac OS. It's pretty clear that the bugs can be fixed, and that preemptive multitasking and protected memory can be added to the creaky old OS that gets so much bad press, without breaking apps (too much). "/>
			<outline text="If Apple fitted the current OS to the needs of the existing base of server apps, that would probably please the largest number of customers. We'd be happy to work with them on this, engineer-to-engineer. "/>
			<outline text="When we can't get our act together on this side of the supply line, customers get confused. Customers who are confused don't buy new stuff. The money dries up. Bad news for businesses that depend on their money."/>
			<outline text="It's OK if Apple wants to pursue new business with OracleWare, but please let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Learn to say the words that make users feel safe. Speeches about new networking strategies should include references to the software that the users currently use. Learn a lesson from Microsoft here, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Embrace and extend. Discontinuities suck. Improve performance and fix bugs and work with developers and users instead of dictating to them."/>
			<outline text="***Big wakes"/>
			<outline text="Unless they start talking about the existing base soon, it's over. I've been down this path many times. No need to repeat the lessons. Apple PR creates big wakes. It doesn't matter how wounded Apple is. Jobs is a big draw. If he's talking about Oracle and network computers, no one sees WebSTAR or Quid Pro Quo or NetPresenz, etc."/>
			<outline text="Net-effect, Apple doesn't talk to the people who run WebSTAR and compatible server software. They appear to think that it's just a http daemon. That it is, for sure, but it's also a multi-threaded architecture for network applications running on the Mac OS."/>
			<outline text="It would be convenient for the architects of Rhapsody if WebSTAR was just a daemon, that would make the transition easy for the sysops who have built systems around compatible servers. But that isn't the way it is. Much expensive infrastructure has been built. Transitions work, discontinuities don't."/>
			<outline text="So I look at this as an opportunity. That's where I come from. Nature abhors a vacuum. Software developers, like me, love them."/>
			<outline text="Apple can compete for the hearts of Mac sysops. They can win if they want to, because they own the high ground. We can market together. If they come in and learn how we work, who we are, what tools we use, what words we use, they can have the users. "/>
			<outline text="I could sing the song Apple wants me to sing. Or I could sing the song I know so well, and hope they listen. Either way, I believe I'm on solid ground, connecting with people who use the stuff, on their terms, because I use what they use. "/>
			<outline text="That's where I want to be. "/>
			<outline text="***Dear Steve"/>
			<outline text="Can we find a way to both win? "/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Bill Gates on Privacy&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/29/97; 8:58:48 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Privacy should be as big an issue on the net today as free speech was in early 1996. I haven't written about it yet, because like many people, I'm confused. The core of my confusion comes from the difficulty of it. "/>
			<outline text="After getting an email last week from Bill Gates (following) I decided to do whatever it took to get into the signed messages world, to learn about encryption, to catch up on the history, to understand the issues, and to have an informed opinion on where we should go."/>
			<outline text="First, the email from Gates."/>
			<outline text="***Bill Gates on Privacy"/>
			<outline text="From Bill Gates, billg@microsoft.com:"/>
			<outline text="Since I last sent you email on this topic things have gotten a lot worse."/>
			<outline text="The FBI and the Administration have bills in both the Congress and the Senate that would force all software sold in the United States by 1999 to allow the government to get at the keys without the user knowing. "/>
			<outline text="Besides the issues of this making it very difficult for us to sell software to countries like Germany and Canada who want strong encryption without any backdoor and the issue of how to have the old software work with the new, there is a huge issue of privacy here. The backdoors that the government is requiring would create a huge security hole that could be misused."/>
			<outline text="I am spending a lot of time on this - calling Congressmen and Senators. However the FBI and the administration are suggesting that restricting the software industry is key to fighting criminals. Of course they don't say that criminals will still find it very easy to pre-encrypt the information they send."/>
			<outline text="For some reason the public isn't hearing about this issue at all. I can't believe there isn't more of an outcry. When it went from an export restriction to a restriction on sofware in the US there should have been a lot of headlines."/>
			<outline text="***Signing messages"/>
			<outline text="I got an email from Bill Gates! That's exciting. Now..."/>
			<outline text="Did it really come from him?"/>
			<outline text="How can I tell?"/>
			<outline text="***Why sign? "/>
			<outline text="Let's say you're sending an email to your stock broker, ordering the sale of 100,000 shares of Microsoft to be invested in a new high tech IPO. "/>
			<outline text="Would you want your broker to accept the order from anyone? And, if the broker executed a bogus order, and you lost a lot of money, who would pay for the loss? "/>
			<outline text="It's pretty clear that both the client and the broker have a strong interest in authentic communication."/>
			<outline text="***Secrecy"/>
			<outline text="OK -- let's say I'm selling a company. This is something I can relate to, because in 1987 I sold a company to Symantec. Microsoft was in the loop too. Their offer to buy my company was the trigger-pull that put our company, Living Videotext, into play. "/>
			<outline text="Email goes back and forth between board members and the prospective buyers and their board members and execs. Accountants, lawyers, all kinds of consultants, are in the loop too. "/>
			<outline text="Without thinking, we don't wonder who could be listening in to our conversation, and how damaging it could be to our interests if the negotiations weren't private."/>
			<outline text="We assume our electronic conversations are private, but what if they aren't?"/>
			<outline text="***Find me six million people"/>
			<outline text="Right now, in the US, we have a government that's legally commited to free speech, guaranteed by courts and protected by the Constitution. But we could have a revolution or a coup, a totalitarian government comes in, and decides to cleanse society of its opposition. It's happened before, it could happen here, it's certain to happen somewhere in the world, sometime soon."/>
			<outline text="Before the coup, a group in the FBI, with powerful surveillance software, captures the email streams of everyone they want to discredit after the revolt. With electronic technologies that exist today their net could be very broad. And with database and natural language software they could query huge amounts of email. Or they could archive messages, awaiting technology that would allow computers to really understand what people are saying in their emails."/>
			<outline text="Even dictatorships depend on the support of the people. Hitler went on campaign against Jews. Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. A new cyberdictator could ask his MIS department to do a query against the email database. Find me six million people to kill, and give me a reason to kill them."/>
			<outline text="We like computers, but please understand that they could be used to hurt or kill people too. Perhaps we live in a benevolent society, but that could change."/>
			<outline text="***Upgrade!"/>
			<outline text="What to do? It's really simple. Upgrade! It's confusing, but it's legal. If you're a US citizen, you have the right to sign your messages and make them private."/>
			<outline text="Once the software is installed you can use Eudora or Claris Emailer to send signed or private email by clicking on an icon in an email window and entering a password into a dialog box after you send the message."/>
			<outline text="***Make it easy"/>
			<outline text="To Bill Gates, and other software developers, let's embrace the expense of producing different versions of the software for the US and outside. Let's invest in making it trivially simple for people to send secure messages, with the absolute minimum of setup and maintenence. "/>
			<outline text="Let's behave as if the laws that are under consideration in the US Congress won't pass. Set a direction now, while we still have our rights. Build an installed base that's educated and informed."/>
			<outline text="It's in all our interests to work together. The software industry, at its best, is about creativity and free expression. A bit of money, some extra effort, will pay off in goodwill and future profits."/>
			<outline text="Key point: today, both digital signing and encryption are legal and except for international rules imposed by the US government, unregulated. Once we've bootstrapped a large installed base of secure communicators, it will be more difficult for the goverment to interfere."/>
			<outline text="Bill, the anti-CDA effort was easier to organize because the issues were clearer. Millions of people were using the web when the government invaded. If millions of people used secure email, the issues would be clearer to more people."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/30/97; 7:37:54 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I've gotten lots of really great mail in reply to &quot;Bill Gates on Privacy&quot;. Almost everyone is positive about it. "/>
			<outline text="I'm still confused about how it works, but I've had success in sending and reading signed and encrypted messages. "/>
			<outline text="Now I want *everyone* to have a PGP-aware mail program."/>
			<outline text="Ever the evangelist..."/>
			<outline text="***Get a buddy"/>
			<outline text="I've learned one important thing, you need a friend to help you get up to speed, so you have someone to try it out with, someone you can send a signed message to, so you can tell if it's working, or not. It's best if your buddy already is using PGP, but it's not necessary.  You can learn together."/>
			<outline text="If everyone who gets up to speed then takes responsibility for getting two more people up the curve it won't take long before everyone is PGPable."/>
			<outline text="***A pointer"/>
			<outline text="The pointer to the MIT site with the privacy software got wiped in a crash (alpha software!) yesterday, so here it is, in today's piece:"/>
			<outline text="http://bs.mit.edu:8001/pgp-form.html "/>
			<outline text="Sorry for the omission! "/>
			<outline text="***Sam Nunn states the problem"/>
			<outline text="Charles Fitzgerald, charlesf@microsoft.com, tells a story. &quot;We need a way to get exposure beyond Web denizens into the world the politicos inhabit. Sam Nunn was at a conference last week where he told one of our people 'I'd love to talk more to you computer types, but all you ever want to talk about is crypto.'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Interesting."/>
			<outline text="***Get Bill Clinton on Email"/>
			<outline text="It's a marketing problem. "/>
			<outline text="Susan A. Kitchens, susan@auntialias.com, describes the solution."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The other day, as I was perusing all the 'Chelsea moves in to Stanford' stories that have been surrounding the event, one thing caught my eye -- a statment that Bill Clinton, Chelsea's dad, has been promising to figure out how to use email to correspond with her. I hope he does."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Naturally, in the wake of the debate on privacy and paparazzi with the death of the Princess of Wales, and the implication for the normal upbringing and college education of a daughter of note, I can see it happen this way:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Mr. Clinton figures out how to send email to his daughter. Someone starts packet-sniffing for the correspondence. Letters from Dad end up being front page news. Mr. Clinton gets encryption religion.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Ms. Kitchens has a website at http://www.auntialias.com/. "/>
			<outline text="***John Doerr"/>
			<outline text="Key point, political celebrities are probably already tuned into the privacy issue, just say the word paparazzi, but we keep talking about cryptography. "/>
			<outline text="This is not a technical issue, it's a human issue. Visions of hackers on virtual motorcycles, prying into Clinton's private email will drive the point home. Stories about bit streams and encryption algorithms make non-technical eyes glaze over."/>
			<outline text="John Doerr, a longtime DaveNetter, is also friends with Bill Clinton. John, please help Bill get on email. It's worth it."/>
			<outline text="***Denise Caruso"/>
			<outline text="Finally, from Denise Caruso, dc@technomedia.com, a visiting scholar at Interval Research, and a columnist at the New York Times:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;I'm very happy to hear that Bill Gates (or someone with access to his email address, at least) has gotten a wee tad of religion about privacy. I'm also really glad that he has written to you about it."/>
			<outline text="&quot;I'm a little less happy about the sentence, 'Besides the issues of this making it very difficult for us to sell software ... there is a huge issue of privacy here.'  The sentence is perhaps more revelatory than he knows."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Gates goes on to say, 'For some reason the public isn't hearing about this issue at all. I can't believe there isn't more of an outcry.' Perhaps this is because virtually every corporate executive who speaks out about the encryption debate -- Gates and Barksdale at Netscape are the two that come most immediately to mind  -- approaches it from the perspective of 'weak encryption is bad for our business.'  Privacy issues, if mentioned at all, are always an afterthought."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The public at large really couldn't care less about whether companies can sell their software overseas. Why should they care whether Bill Gates or any other executive can increase their net worth?  Although the industry's inability to sell encryption products abroad will certainly have an effect on the U.S. population at some point in time, for the majority of us this is a second-order effect. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;As someone who in fact has been trying to bring the encryption debate into the public eye -- most recently in the New York Times, but really in every single publication and in every type of media I've touched for the past 10 years -- I have always found it sadly revealing that protecting corporate self-interest has consistently been more important than protecting civil liberties."/>
			<outline text="&quot;If Gates wants to put Microsoft's formidable marketing and advertising machine to work and raise public awareness about just how precarious our rights to privacy and security have become under the present U.S. administration, he would be providing a great and critical service not just to our citizenry, but to the rest of the world as well. I know a number of people who would line up to help in any way they can.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;I Liked The Ad&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/2/97; 12:26:01 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="One of the things we talked about at the DaveNet Live session on Tuesday is Apple's latest &quot;Think Different&quot; TV ad and the print and billboard campaign behind it. "/>
			<outline text="If you have QuickTime, you can watch the movie right now."/>
			<outline text="http://www.apple.com/thinkdifferent/ad1.mov "/>
			<outline text="I liked the ad because Apple told us that they remember who they are. "/>
			<outline text="This is important because they totally forgot."/>
			<outline text="***Advertising is not merchandising "/>
			<outline text="How much do you cost? "/>
			<outline text="Who are you? "/>
			<outline text="Which is the more interesting question?"/>
			<outline text="Advertising is not merchandising.  It can be, but advertising at its best and its most interesting can simply tell you who they are. "/>
			<outline text="***My reaction"/>
			<outline text="I had an emotional reaction. I could feel it in my body. "/>
			<outline text="It represented my values. I don't know if it's possible for those values to be owned by an inanimate object such as a computer. Once it was. I remember my first view of a Macintosh. What a charmer! I remember that it was once possible for a computer to have a philosophy and to make a statement."/>
			<outline text="Today most computers are like the Macintosh and I've long since incorporated the magic of the machine into my workflow. It feels like a tool now. I have set up my NT 4.0 machine to work like a Mac, so I feel more at home there now too."/>
			<outline text="Does my use of a Mac make me different? In some sense yes, but maybe this kind of difference isn't so positive. See &quot;Another Offer to Apple&quot;, when I tried being a Mac zealot for a day last summer, and see where it got me. You pay a price in this world for being different."/>
			<outline text="But if their ads can make us look brilliant for being different, it's just the kind of air cover I've been asking for in DaveNet for almost three years."/>
			<outline text="***Who I am"/>
			<outline text="Think Different does actually say who I am.  I believe in creativity and I believe in being different. I'm the kind of person who would be likely to use Netscape over Microsoft Internet Explorer. Or PGP over S/MIME. I'm the kind of person who would be likely to use the Macintosh over the PC. I will often choose to do something different from what everyone else does."/>
			<outline text="In that sense the ad actually did a pretty good job of identifying what it is about the Macintosh that is different -- it appeals to people who want to be different."/>
			<outline text="***Softening on Steve"/>
			<outline text="I went back and re-read &quot;He Was Beautiful&quot;, written on August 1, just as Steve Jobs was taking over at Apple. I thought he couldn't turn the clock back. I thought I'd agree with what I said just two months ago, but the road has twisted in ways I didn't forsee."/>
			<outline text="I find the place I had in my heart for Apple is still there. I find this surprising, but believe it or not, it feels good!"/>
			<outline text="***On the other hand"/>
			<outline text="Apple tells us what's good about them, but don't forget, it's just an advertisement. The philosophy of difference, of empowerment of the individual, must be practiced, not just presented in advertising."/>
			<outline text="Apple's record of empowerment of individuals is weak. Jobs and his agency tell a beautiful story, but behind the scenes it's not really that pretty. Inside Apple, it's about regimentation, following the party line. I imagine that in the Jobsian pecking order developers are even further down the feeding chain. Jobs has a history of trying to control developers, always with disastrous results. "/>
			<outline text="Developers, at their best, are creative different people like the people portrayed in the ad. Apple has had low tolerance of developers blazing their own trails, even when history has proven that they were on the right trail and Apple was barking up the wrong tree."/>
			<outline text="Maybe there's room for change. If so, Steve, make the story consistent. Practice what you speak. If genius shows up in Apple's backyard, don't silence it, trust it."/>

			<outline text="Namaste y'all! "/>
			<outline text="Today is the three-year anniversary of DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="The divinity in my being acknowledges the divinity in yours."/>
			<outline text="With a Texas drawwwwwl."/>
			<outline text="Yeah, here we are starting the fourth year of DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="Could the web be that old?"/>
			<outline text="Yes it could."/>
			<outline text="***451 pieces, 2.2MB"/>
			<outline text="This is the 452nd piece. "/>
			<outline text="A total of 2.2 megabytes of all-electronic text. "/>
			<outline text="No trees died making DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="But we did lots of diggin!"/>
			<outline text="***Three years ago"/>
			<outline text="DaveNet started as an exercise in volunteerism. My friend Marc Canter was launching a new product called Meet the Media Band. I was idle, having retired from the software business in December 1993. I had some scripts that could do mass emailing, I had lots of email addresses of important people I had met at various conferences over the years. So I did Marc a favor, three years ago today and unbeknownst to him, I sent a notice of his press conference to about 300 people."/>
			<outline text="I attended the event on 10/11/94 in San Francisco. It was fun! At the conference Marc handed out a folder that included an opinionated list of ten things that the multimedia press doesn't get about multimedia. A distillation of Marc's standard rap about media. He was frustrated and expressed it well. I was already thinking in terms of readers and what they might find interesting, so the morning after the press conference I sent &quot;Marc's 10 Things&quot; to the 300 people."/>
			<outline text="I imagined that people must have been puzzled, and maybe even upset with me, for sending them this stuff. But I went thru that and sent the email anyway. I still feel this trepidation, but it's lighter now. When I send out each DaveNet piece there's a negative voice inside me that's sure that finally everyone will be fed up with me and ask to be removed from the mailing list. A universal judgement! I worry about this, yes I do. But that's just who I am and what I worry about. No big deal."/>
			<outline text="Occasionally someone does resign from DaveNet, it's rare these days, and when it happens I get a little zing, a bit of negative energy. Then I breathe and go on. Whew! Close call."/>
			<outline text="One more thing, re-reading these pieces in October 1997, the editor in me winces, I want to fix the problems I see. I've become a fussier editor over the years. I've developed more of a style. But I respect the dude who wrote them, the younger version of Dave the writer. He had so much to learn, and he learned it! Onward."/>
			<outline text="***I could do it too!"/>
			<outline text="The first two DaveNets were a bootstrap. I used Marc's ideas to show me something about myself. If I could publish Marc's ideas, why couldn't I publish my own?"/>
			<outline text="I remember clearly where I was when this idea came to me. I was driving up 280 from the valley to San Francisco. I had a BMW 750IL then, the top of the line, I called this car my Corporate Jet. It drove like an airplane! A long long car with a 12-cylinder engine. I'm a German cop on the Autobahn! Whoooosh. There goes Dave, in his jet. Hey, the car is gone now, I drive a Nissan pickup, by choice. Interesting, now I lust after BMWs, BTW."/>
			<outline text="In the fast lane on 280, thinking about the emails I sent on Marc's behalf, I realized that I could put my ideas out there too. A solution to a problem -- I get lots of ideas. I want to get the ideas out of my body and hope that other good ideas come back. I know I can't implement most of the ideas I come up with. I've compromised with this over the years -- I share what I discover in all but a few areas where I'm active. It occurred to me, driving north on 280, that email could be a good channel for these ideas."/>
			<outline text="So the next day, Thursday, I sent out an email that I had written to Jim Cannavino, then the top strategy guy at IBM. And the day after that I sent out a survey of the PDA market, which was the big software industry hype issue of the moment in late 1994. I got a response from Randy Battat, Motorola's top PDA exec, and I ran that too. In the first few days, the most basic elements of DaveNet had been designed. "/>
			<outline text="Things were moving very quickly!"/>
			<outline text="***Two pieces"/>
			<outline text="One final thing needed to happen before the full DaveNet formula would be established. I needed to be free, and then I needed to remember what it's like to not be free. I wrote about the Internet, freedom; and the opposite, Apple; in two pieces that, to me, define what DaveNet is about."/>
			<outline text="Understand that these are symbols. There is no such thing as the Internet, nor is there an Apple. These are abstractions that we use to work out our personal issues. Me too!"/>
			<outline text="On 10/18/94, eleven days into it, I wrote &quot;Bill Gates vs The Internet&quot; which was a rallying cry against the VCs and Bill Gates, and the cycle of fear that had developed around them. I saw the Internet as a way around that. "/>
			<outline text="Then on 10/29/94 I wrote the other hell-raiser, &quot;Platform is Chinese Household&quot;, explaining what being a developer meant to me. A lot of energy was released in this piece. "/>
			<outline text="See the problem, we expect developers to stay quiet. Apple still, to this day, acts as if every piece is written for them. What I say and do are heavily judged. They try to punish me for talking. It's always been this way, for every developer. You learn to keep your mouth shut. "/>
			<outline text="But get this, I'm an artist. When have you met an artist that can stay quiet? So the most creative developers have a problem. There are no rewards for staying silent. But if you speak, the platform vendor will kill you. Ooops."/>
			<outline text="There's the reason why the Mac platform was collapsing in late 1994. It was a dysfunctional family, pain being traded against the fear of letting go and moving foward. "/>
			<outline text="And following the Chinese Household formula, life goes on even though husband is very sick and near death."/>
			<outline text="***Fast forward thru three years"/>
			<outline text="Lots of stuff happened on DaveNet between then and now. "/>
			<outline text="In late 1994. I was lucky, I was free. I had my eyes open. I saw something gorgeous, the open standards of the web, in their last period of innocence, ruled by academics and engineers, not much FUD. A quiet and deep playground. A cause for optimism!"/>
			<outline text="Simply put, DaveNet chronicles of the development of the web. Breathless excitement in 1994 and 1995. Fear in 1996. The loop closes in 1997, we're back in fear, just like 1993. "/>
			<outline text="Now there are niches of creativity with little FUD, competitive markets, places for hope and excitement, even if the big headline-grabbers keep bumping into each other painfully."/>
			<outline text="Along the way, over the three years, I learned about respect, blue sky, digging holes and filling them, bodies, men and women, web energy, invasive email (flames), love and fear, the scientific method and space. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape booms, Microsoft invades. A government threatens free speech. Java makes promises it can't keep. The software industry swirls in its cycle of control and defeat. "/>
			<outline text="I was a software developer thru all three years. We invested in web content management software for the Mac. Just as we were delivering, Apple announced its Internet strategy, based on Quicktime and some now-defunct system software. Web content development wasn't part of the story. I decided to heed my own advice, and to not argue with the platform vendor."/>
			<outline text="That's when we decided that a Mac-only strategy couldn't be commercial, so we reinvested in our code base and ported to Windows. The first public release happened last week. Four people on the team, Doug Baron, Bob Bierman, Brent Simmons and myself. We're hiring more people. Diggin in, in shipping mode, having fun, doing it again, all that stuff. We're older too, more mature, we listen better, and ship more powerful stuff that's easier to use. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="A lesson is revealed -- to go forward you have to let go. We used to make boxes of software and put them on retailer's shelves. We used to compete with the platform vendor. Then the web became our platform. We gave our software away. Now we're getting ready to sell software once again, but a major portion of what we do will still be given away freely."/>
			<outline text="***Making money with websites"/>
			<outline text="I thought the Internet was an end-run around the venture capitalists, but that didn't turn out to be true. Instead it became the playground of the VCs! Huge amounts of money flowed into the search engine companies and other schemes to capture web flow. IPOs happened. Some ideas worked, gained flow, and others didn't. "/>
			<outline text="Are the websites that worked making money? The answer depends on what you mean by a website. I think of Netscape as a website. They generate money because they sell software thru the site. In other words, the combination of a high flow site and software that sells is a money-maker. "/>
			<outline text="That's how I think it will shake out. The PE ratios of online companies will be determined by the value of their software, reflected in unique, valuable features, multiplied by the number of people using the software. The more a company influences the direction of the net, the more valuable the company will be. "/>
			<outline text="***Website style"/>
			<outline text="Nowadays a website is about business. Get me to the new stuff quickly. Don't put a lot of gratuitous tricks in my way. If you keep it interesting, I'll reward you by returning. "/>
			<outline text="The early idea of the web as a virtual world is disappearing. Gone are the spatial metaphors, websites with front doors and kitchens and living rooms. These ideas sound great in keynote speeches and newsletters, but don't translate well on cathode ray tubes. Even if interface designers knew how to recreate the physical world on a CRT (they don't), the reader's patience wears thin waiting for all the imagery to download."/>
			<outline text="The web browser makers, Netscape and Microsoft have mistakenly been promoting the flash. Instead they should be focusing on making text look really great, make it easy for us to design dialogs with the user, and look for ways to work around bandwidth limitations. The technology isn't rocket science, we've been down this road before, two or three or four times, depending what you count."/>
			<outline text="Where do we go from here? We'll find the answer in the cacaphony of the design world, the writing world, and the surfer world. "/>
			<outline text="***John Gage on Scripting"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to close another loop. John Gage, Sun's chief scientist, gave a speech at Seybold last week where he said something that I've been saying all along. Even so, I think very few people believed me. Maybe you'll believe Gage."/>
			<outline text="He said that Java isn't the only programming environment that makes sense in the world of the Internet, that scripting will play an important role too. "/>
			<outline text="I obviously agree. When I first saw Java, I saw it aimed at generating graphic apps, not glue that connects servers and content workstations. In other words, Java is not a scripting environment. "/>
			<outline text="I felt then, and I still do, that when people really look at scripting, they'll see much deeper and appropriate solutions for content development."/>
			<outline text="I don't know why we get so obsessed with prognosticators and their visions, I wish we didn't. Look at what's been delivered. We could have skipped a lot of hysteria over Java. What it could be and what it is were two very different things."/>
			<outline text="Thanks to John Gage for having the guts to focus part of the attention away from Java. It'll be easier to do some interesting stuff now."/>
			<outline text="***A song"/>
			<outline text="A brief interlude. If this is going to be a classic DaveNet piece, we have to have a song. Hey, it's Sheryl Crow! A change. A change. A change would do you good!"/>
			<outline text="Right on..."/>
			<outline text="***What is DaveNet?"/>
			<outline text="You might think that after three years of writing these pieces. I'd know what's going on, but I'm still learning. The rate of learning is accelerating because I'd like to turn the story into a printed book. This has brought me closer to the why and what of it. Why do I do it, and what is it?"/>
			<outline text="First, I have a contribution to make, and until I started doing DaveNet I was frustrated. I was able to make money, and was also able to add to the state of the art of software, but I wasn't able to get credit for it, or have people be willing to bet on my track record. After three years of building a reputation as a writer and thinker, that's changed. I no longer have the same issues with the industry."/>
			<outline text="After writing a recent piece, a correspondent asked a deep question -- how does my role in the industry compare to the role I played in my family? Of course it's exactly the same role! I see a solution to a puzzle, people should just work together, but in the end my efforts are futile. "/>
			<outline text="I'm very comfortable with this loop, but lately the loop has been breaking, not due to anything I'm doing, as far as I can tell. Several people who I respect in the industry have asked me to help them with projects because they think people care about what I say. These people are changing, not viewing me the same way or viewing themselves the same way. And I'm growing too, I'm getting what I've always said I wanted. I get to find out what it's like on the other side. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="Bigger picture, writing DaveNet helps me heal. The most recent example is the &quot;I Do&quot; piece, which is a response to my unloved inner child. It was the result of a phone conversation with a close friend who had two alchoholic parents. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;You deserved better than you got,&quot; I said. I kept talking, and the piece formed. After that it was a few days before the story went out to the readers. It took a while for me to muster the courage!"/>
			<outline text="When I'm ready, I share my lessons, and what comes back makes it even better. It's amazing how beautiful emails can be when you reach inside people and find the loving inner kids. It's an incredible reward."/>
			<outline text="Finally, I'd like my legacy to be that I helped people be kinder to each other, to find more fun in other people, not to be so threatened by the differences between people."/>
			<outline text="***Will Rodgers and Sylvia"/>
			<outline text="I saw a television biography of Will Rodgers, a famous American personality from the early 20th century. I learned something that offended me -- his entire life was on the record, everything he did was a publicity event. It resonated with me, because I fear that my life will be this way."/>
			<outline text="Last Tuesday my friend Sylvia asked why I was so interested in privacy software when all aspects of my life are discussed in DaveNet. My response is that it's not true. I have friendships that influence what I write that are not disclosed or written about. "/>
			<outline text="I do this for a very practical reason, I want to have friends! If every handshake or kiss or caress or confidence were a press conference, I'd be sharing no love, having no fun, and there would be nothing in life worth living!"/>
			<outline text="So there's a line I don't cross. I don't tell everything. "/>
			<outline text="I just tell what I want you to know."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Thanks to the thousands of people who read DaveNet!"/>

			<outline text="In fact I have been doing DaveNet-like things for a lot longer than three years. It started when I was a grad student at UW-Madison in the mid-late 70s. We had Unix and email, and daemons that sent BEL messages to all the terminals connected to the machine. Push technology! (With no security model.)"/>
			<outline text="Late at night we'd write scripts that traveled around the building. You could audibly hear the performance of the PDP-11/45 that was running the script. I loved those days. What a time of discovery! By the way, sometimes we would run those scripts in the middle of the day. Oooops!"/>
			<outline text="***The DaveNet Book"/>
			<outline text="I've been thinking about creating a printed book from the three years of DaveNet. "/>
			<outline text="One possible approach: carefully pick 30 pieces out of the 451 that had impact, or said something unique, or revealed something that turned out to be important."/>
			<outline text="But I want to be more creative as we move to print. There's an opportunity here, a puzzle. Perhaps the last piece, &quot;Three Years of DaveNet&quot;, could be the intro for the book? Or perhaps the following story, extended to 1994?"/>

			<outline text="Sadly, it's not there yet, that's why they couldn't find it!"/>
			<outline text="Why? Our code base on the Mac is more mature, and since all Frontier 4 users are Mac users, we wanted to start out on the right foot by bringing them up to the 5.0 level before starting a new installed base of Windows 95 and Windows NT users."/>
			<outline text="How do I feel about this? I totally ache to get the Windows software out! It actually hurts... So the first task for my four-person team, from now until its release, is to ship a version that can build automated websites on Windows. That's when the doors open for us. "/>
			<outline text="So what are we waiting for? We want to get the most visible glitches out before releasing. First impressions count a lot. This is a new piece of software. We want to get it right. Still diggin here. Coming sooooon!"/>
			<outline text="***Miko"/>
			<outline text="Java's chief evangelist, Miko Matsumura, miko@miko.com, sent a response to Microsoft's response to Sun's lawsuit. Miko's message is at:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/MikoEvangelizes.html "/>
			<outline text="This is the first time Sun has used Scripting News to communicate with "/>
			<outline text="the industry. I like it! "/>
			<outline text="***A heads-up"/>
			<outline text="Switching gears..."/>
			<outline text="Something to think about if you send email thru your company's mail server. It's easy for your company to install a script on the server that saves a copy of every message that's going to a specific domain such as scripting.com or well.com.  "/>
			<outline text="I believe some organizations already have systems like this. A human looks at the folder every day, reads each message, and if it's too revealing, forwards it to the personnel people and the company's lawyer. "/>
			<outline text="So if you send the email thru your employer's mail server, they may hear what you say, if you say it to me. "/>
			<outline text="A word to the wise!"/>
			<outline text="***Some philosophy"/>
			<outline text="I wear both hats here. I run a website but I also am an employer. "/>
			<outline text="I insist on the right to speak for my company. I must trust my employees, and they must not betray that trust. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, some people want outlets for their ideas without having them filtered up a chain of command. I depend on that kind of flow of information. The hearts and brains of the products I'm interested in are in the lower levels of the management structures at most companies. "/>
			<outline text="I get a lot from hearing from CEOs and other execs, but I also get a lot from hearing from the people who write and manage products. Most often, that kind of communication must be protected in order for people to keep their jobs. It seems fair to me."/>
			<outline text="So I'm right on the fence on this one. I experience both sides of the issue. As an editor I favor stories that are interesting, timely, opinionated and truthful. As an employer I must be able to trust my team."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: UserLand Software, at this time, does not have any way to capture email messages from its employees or contractors."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Here's a relatively safe way to send sensitive messages. Keep a mail account at a public service provider like aol.com, hotmail.com, best.com or pacbell.net. Send messages from your home computer, using the public mail server."/>

			<outline text="I had a wierd dream last night. Bill Gates and Scott McNealy were members of a reggae band. Dancing and weaving just like Toots and the Maytalls. Diddly diddly diddly Rasta Man! They were happy! What makes McNealy and Gates happy? That's what this piece is about."/>
			<outline text="***Java Java Java"/>
			<outline text="I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/JavaStories.html&quot;&gt;written so much&lt;/a&gt; about Java. More than a dozen pieces. Most of them deal with confusion -- what is Java? In the end, I decided that Java is a brand and nothing more. It could be anything Sun wants it to be. It's not even a product yet. The excitement, which I never really understood, is wearing thin."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="The Microsoft generals are speaking this week. The Sun lawsuit gave them something to talk about. The CNET &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.com/SpecialFeatures/0,5,14704,00.html &quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Bill Gates was the rollout. What a revealing piece. The gloves come off!"/>
			<outline text="All along I imagined that there was a philospohy at Microsoft that separated apps from system software. Now we hear that it's just economics. Given the proper financial motivation, Microsoft will bundle anything. Ouch!"/>
			<outline text="***Money Money Money"/>
			<outline text="How much money does Bill Gates want and why does he want so much? "/>
			<outline text="In my own life, I used to like to play SimCity, but I've totally mastered it. I can make cities as big and rich as I want. Where's the fun? "/>
			<outline text="Gates can have as much money as he wants. All his talk about competition is PR and not much more. Let's get real. Microsoft can have any  market it wants, because it can hire the best people, and it has so much money it can wait indefinitely. They can outlast any competitor. They have enough money to make that happen. "/>
			<outline text="But I wonder, why does Gates want more money when he already has so much? I asked this question in &quot;Bill Gates's Money&quot;, 7/3/97. I still don't get it. It's a totally foreign thing to me. I'm being honest. His money is such an issue in the software business, it comes up all the time, but we know so little about it. We know he has a lot. Why?"/>
			<outline text="***Sun's fear"/>
			<outline text="Sun just won't let Java go. One school says that there should be an ANSI standard for Java. There should be a GNU version of Java. Instead, we've learned that a minimal Java license costs $250K to start, $300K per year, $5 per copy. Could someone legally implement a clean-room version of Java? That's not clear. Some say no, but some say otherwise."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's greed and Sun's fear (and greed too) balance each other perfectly. We can argue about it indefinitely, the headlines are fun, for a while, but they're all air because we don't know what the deal is. "/>
			<outline text="How much did Microsoft pay to Sun? One number I've heard is $15 million. But then I heard from inside Sun that Microsoft agreed to pay that amount, but never actually paid."/>
			<outline text="***A nasty soup of politics"/>
			<outline text="Is Java just a programming language? This may surprise some people, but my answer is no, it's become much more than a programming language."/>
			<outline text="It's turned into a perfect capsule for software industry BS and manipulation at its worst. Scott McNealy and Bill Gates appear to be working out their personal issues in public, using developers as pawns; at least developers who were foolish enough to get in the middle of this fray."/>
			<outline text="Gates is rich, but McNealy also has more money than any human could spend in a lifetime. They're playing a disgusting game with the livelihoods and creativity of developers, and are crowding out other possible headline grabbing software. They've turned the Internet into a nasty soup of politics. I'm sick of the greed and personal ambition. Do they know why they're making such a mess? Let's hear it."/>
			<outline text="My opinion is that neither Sun or Microsoft is qualified to lead the software industry. A leader has to have a philosophy, be responsible, have a place for partners, be open to competition, not try to control markets, to believe in other people's power, not try to neutralize it. Microsoft, there are other people out here. Sun might want to check that out too. See &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;, 10/24/96, for details."/>
			<outline text="But Sun's position in my world is new. We can attribute some of their gaffes to inexperience. Microsoft is a different story. If they got a bit more mature it would be clear that the opportunity to move beyond business as usual is right here right now. "/>
			<outline text="The stalemate is keeping Microsoft from being respected in the larger world. I'm sorry I just can't get behind the Poor Microsoft theory. Who's Bill Gates? He's the man with all the money. He can't lose. Convince me otherwise. I read the CNET interview."/>
			<outline text="Finally, who cares what Scott McNealy thinks? Microsoft clearly cares about that a lot. I don't."/>
			<outline text="***Where's the contract?"/>
			<outline text="We haven't seen the contract between Microsoft and Sun re Java. What's the deal? How much of a cash cow is Java for Sun? How hard did they stick it to Microsoft? How much is this Bill Gates lashing out at Sun for playing hardball with him? We won't have a clue until the agreement comes out officially, or if it's leaked. "/>
			<outline text="Every technology reporter on the planet should be digging for this document. Let's get it, let's read it, and see what's really going on."/>
			<outline text="***Mediation"/>
			<outline text="Taking this to court is the low road."/>
			<outline text="We could come up with a compromise that radically alters the structure of the software industry, takes the focus off Microsoft, and lets Sun return to its roots making servers and database hardware."/>
			<outline text="If both Gates and McNealy had a true desire to get out of the stalemate, it would be easy to do. With their resources, options, they could clear the way for a great new generation of software. Instead, they've made themselves the issue, and until we learn more, they just aren't that interesting."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/17/97; 12:55:35 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Gooood afternoooon!"/>
			<outline text="I'm back from New Orleans, I totally fell in love, again, with the city I lived in during college. The weather was hot, then it rained, then it got cold and wintry, and then on Wednesday a crisp fall-like day with not a cloud in the sky. "/>
			<outline text="I went walking all three days. Morning and evening, rain and shine, in the French Quarter and uptown. "/>
			<outline text="I lived in many houses in New Orleans. On the first day I walked past the house I lived in the longest. A gorgeous neighborhood, Joseph Street and Prytania, uptown, across from a Jewish graveyard and one block from Langenstein's grocery store. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was living in a Jewish neighborhood! Maybe, coming from New York, being in a Jewish neighborhood wasn't so impressive? "/>
			<outline text="I went back to days when I was very confused by life. I felt the pain of being 18 years old, having uprooted myself from comfortable confusion in the northeast and relocating in the foreign confusion of the Old South; where boys and girls my age screwed with a system I didn't understand. "/>
			<outline text="Some things are gone. In the old days black people used to ride on the back of the streetcar, now it's integrated. Some things haven't changed, white people are still afraid of the blacks, maybe blacks of whites (I couldn't tell). I was afraid then too, but since then I've been to Jamaica four times; you get over it, eventually."/>
			<outline text="A couple of days later, my buddy Chuck and I boarded a streetcar heading uptown. The streetcar driver sings (really I didn't imagine this, Chuck can verify it). He sings, &quot;I been working on the railroad.&quot; Repeat it many times, with a New Orleans accent. He's giddy. Get this -- I think he's happy! And that's what makes New Orleans so special, it's an American city, but by default people smile and sing and say hello. It's a happy place. I think I didn't understand this when I was younger."/>
			<outline text="***Making noise"/>
			<outline text="Honestly I thought the Web Builder conference, sponsored by CNET, was going to be much smaller and less interesting than it was. I went because Dan Shafer, the leader of the conference is a longtime friend, and I wanted to support him; and also because I was curious about New Orleans, my college days, and how it would look now that I'm more mature."/>
			<outline text="But the conference was fan-tas-tic! Almost a thousand people from all over the world. All of them accomplished web masters, designers, writers, business people. There was clearly a need for this conference. That there was such a big need, surprised me."/>
			<outline text="I led four sessions, DaveNet style, I hold the mike and travel through the audience. No panel of experts, no Q&amp;A, no sarcasm or unanswered power trips. If you want to know more about this style of conference, check out &quot;Sept 30 in SF&quot;, 8/28/97."/>
			<outline text="The CNET folks added a twist -- every attendee got a clicker, a simple device, non-electronic, that makes a loud clicking sound when you squeeze it, and one when you let go. Click-clack. It's a way for a member of the audience to provide somewhat anonymous instant feedback to a speaker, expressing displeasure or boredom. "/>
			<outline text="On Tuesday night at 9:30PM, after a walk thru the French Quarter (no I didn't drink!) I led an open mike session of people showing off their websites. We discovered new uses of the clickers. "/>
			<outline text="At one point Shafer asked if we all really disliked what the presenter was saying. I offered a suggestion. &quot;Dan, maybe we just like to make noise?&quot; Everyone laughed."/>
			<outline text="Yeah, I think that's it."/>
			<outline text="***Beautiful places"/>
			<outline text="Industry conferences are held in places with great food and music, or in big interesting cities like Boston, New York, San Francisco and New Orleans; or places that are inspiring in some other way like Crested Butte, Colorado. Warm places in winter; scenic beauty in spring and fall."/>
			<outline text="But the conferences are all the same, held in dark rooms with a brightly lit stage, speakers (often) droning on and on, audiences falling asleep, disconnections, questions going unanswered, people with ideas that don't get heard. The interesting stuff, the personal experiences, happen in the hallway and outdoors."/>
			<outline text="I wonder how to get the outdoor and hallway energy to enter the conference-room. Could you hold sessions on location, on top of a mountain or in a great jazz club? Or could send the attendees on a mission to experience the location, and then come back to a room to talk about it?"/>
			<outline text="Aside from simply being pleasurable, bringing the locale into a conference could help steer the discussion in a positive direction. If you've just been on a hike up the mountain, or dancing on Bourbon Street, you can't help but see the big picture, the forest *and* the trees. More chances to make new friends and learn new tricks."/>
			<outline text="***Living in New Orleans"/>
			<outline text="A bit of evangelism. While in New Orleans I checked out the real estate ads for houses in the uptown section of the city and then took a walking tour of some of the neighborhoods. "/>
			<outline text="Conclusion -- housing costs much less than in New York or California, the neighborhoods and the houses are stunningly beautiful, and the quality of life appears to be higher. On the other hand, it's hot and it rains a lot, racial issues are important and the crime rate is high."/>
			<outline text="Even so, it struck me as a town with a culture and lifestyle that could support a vibrant web developer community, fors not-too-rich people who want to live in a stimulating, interesting and happy place."/>
			<outline text="Anyone interested? Anyone already there?"/>
			<outline text="***Two books"/>
			<outline text="I read Jim Carlton's new book on Apple during the trip to New Orleans. I didn't like it. Carlton's theory, that big executive and engineering egos played a big role in the demise of Apple, is probably true. "/>
			<outline text="But the only screwup worth mentioning, in my opinion, is that they never understood that the interesting stuff was mostly happening outside of Apple. In other words, Carlton made the same mistake that the Apple execs made. "/>
			<outline text="An exciting book would track the migration of Mac users and developers, their ideas and creations, including the people who did various versions of the OS, starting in the late 80s and continuing thru the late 90s. "/>
			<outline text="Coming home I started reading Cadillac Desert by Marc Reisner. A sweeping tale of greed, of a fall yet to be taken, the story of many millions of lives, including mine! "/>
			<outline text="Reisner has the perspective that Carlton can't have, the cities in the US desert, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, to name a few; are already built, and have been growing for almost 100 years. "/>
			<outline text="The Mac platform that Carlton writes about may just be a chapter or two in the more interesting story of what was happening in communication technology since the founding of Apple. "/>
			<outline text="Carlton misses the innovations of graphic productivity apps, desktop publishing, and even email and the web, because these innovations didn't happen at Apple. To miss that is to miss the only interesting story about Apple Computer, Inc. -- that they were so focused on themselves that they missed opportunities all around them."/>
			<outline text="***Java, Microsoft, Sun and Everyone Else"/>
			<outline text="I'm working with Chuck Shotton on a Java piece, but we keep seeing new angles that we want to explore before writing it. Some of the theories are on the Scripting News home page today. We may have something over the weekend or on Monday. "/>

			<outline text="We talked mostly about Java and cross-platform programming; a little about the Macintosh, and focused on the future, not Microsoft's current legal dispute with Sun. "/>
			<outline text="The conversation came about thru a DaveNet piece, &quot;Money Money Money&quot; (MMM) and a semi-public hallway conversation with Eric Rudder, a member of Gates's staff, in New Orleans at the Web Builder conference; which was followed up with a phone conversation with Charles Fitzgerald on Thursday. The Gates conversation was heated and opinionated (at times) but friendly and respectful at all times."/>

			<outline text="Speaking for myself only, I'm looking for a way to turn the current dispute between Sun and Microsoft over Java into something positive for independent developers, especially those interested in cross-platform solutions and programming the Internet at the client, content production and server levels.

			<outline text="Microsoft scored big with its investment in Apple (Gates agrees). More deals like this can happen. In MMM I said &quot;We could come up with a compromise that radically alters the structure of the software industry.&quot; The Microsoft-Apple deal is the prototype for that restructuring, and I hope we took a positive step in that direction today."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's view of the world and Sun's cannot come into agreement. Sun has clearly stated that they want to compete with Windows, and as I've said before it's unreasonable to expect Microsoft to support this. "/>
			<outline text="Like many developers, I can't afford to get caught in the middle of the conflicts between Sun and Microsoft. I encouraged Gates to look beyond this faceoff, and see a chance to add to the momentum of his APIs, without standing in the way of the protocols that Sun et al are promoting."/>
			<outline text="Sun has made it clear that they want to continue to call the shots on the evolution of Java. This could limit Java's future; but I believe it's Sun's call. "/>
			<outline text="Things are happening too quickly now for me to write up every step of the process. I wish I had two bodies so I could do it all. Maybe when the dust settles I'll get a chance to do that."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/20/97; 5:50:16 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Who is the man behind the curtain and what does he want? "/>
			<outline text="All the money in the world, if anyone has it, Bill Gates does. But he can't erase the problem many of us try to solve -- to get the world to understand and appreciate us for who we are, on our terms. "/>
			<outline text="I get it. I'm the same way."/>
			<outline text="***Listening"/>
			<outline text="Talking with Microsoft people over the last week, I think I see the story. I don't think they can coordinate their confusion and our confusion. If you believe they can, go for it. I think these people are frustrated! That's what I hear. I would be frustrated if I were in their shoes. "/>
			<outline text="It took me a long time to get this -- Microsoft wasn't trying to kill Java, they were trying to make it fit into their world. Microsoft sees it as a way to program COM objects. They want Java to fit into their platform the same way we harnessed Frontier to control AppleScript objects. Same story, different platform, different times."/>
			<outline text="Sun doesn't want to allow Microsoft to pervert Java for their purposes, and they limit me too. (I'm not pure!) I want Java to run seamlessly in my world, to have my development tools edit Java source code, to allow Java code to easily access information stored in our object database. Gates had a strong reaction to this story. His immediate impulse was to break thru this wall. Right on! (That's the best way for a platform vendor's mind to work, IMHO.)"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft didn't buy into the Sun positioning of Java; think about it, if you were Bill Gates, would you? He said that they intend to obey the letter of the Sun contract. Everyone's watching, we have the contract now; we can independently decide if they're living up to the agreement. Many people who know Java are on the web now, we don't need Sun to determine if Microsoft is in compliance."/>
			<outline text="After the release of the contract, the lawsuit seems pretty obsolete now. Sun could drop the suit, the market is educated, we can take care of it from here."/>
			<outline text="***CORBA or COM?"/>
			<outline text="The largest issue between Sun and Microsoft appears to be over the Remote Method Invocation APIs in Java, or RMI. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft wants developers to build on COM. Sun wants developers to do CORBA. It's not a big deal. Serious commercial developers will support both. In-house developers can pick the one they like. We supported different scripting models on the Mac. Put a layer in to insulate users from the differences. It's worth the effort."/>
			<outline text="To say Java can only be used to implement CORBA is a self-serving limitation for Sun to try to impose. It's a dead-end because the market will support what it wants to support. It's a ouija board, not a controlled economy. The RMI issue is about plumbing protocols, a boring argument. Instead of asking the court to decide, let the market decide."/>
			<outline text="***Write Once Run Anywhere"/>
			<outline text="Gates doesn't believe Write Once Run Anywhere will yield useful software. But he can't know for sure if it will or won't. "/>
			<outline text="Other developers do believe in WORA, and maybe they're right. Microsoft shouldn't stand in the way. By the way, I don't believe they are standing in the way."/>
			<outline text="***Zig where Sun zags"/>
			<outline text="I asked Gates to think bigger. How did it happen that Sun, Oracle, IBM, Netscape et al, got a say in the future of the Windows operating system? Do they have that power if Gates doesn't give it to them?"/>
			<outline text="The problem is mostly public relations. In the PR leading up to the IE 4.0 launch, Microsoft's message wasn't very warm and fuzzy. I got confused, so did a lot of other people. So, like a programmer testing a new piece of software, I hope Microsoft looks at what worked, and what didn't."/>
			<outline text="I asked him to look at the wave of goodwill created by the $150 million investment in Apple. He could blow everyone's minds by doing more deals like that. That kind of air cover allows Microsoft to speak more softly. Microsoft is *much* bigger with developers than Sun, IBM, Netscape or Oracle. Their stature can elevate them above the noise. But I think they must like the noise, since they seek it out. Makes for good theater, good radio, but it doesn't make them feel appreciated, and I really think they want to be appreciated."/>
			<outline text="Java sucked up developer energy from the Mac platform, OS/2 and various flavors of Unix. What do these developers want? Independence. Give them what they want. Empower a community. Do it again, broaden it, don't require purity. Zig where Sun zags. Be more inclusive. Be a meeting place, where software of all flavors can work together. Does it have to be written in Java? Of course not."/>
			<outline text="What do developers want? At the core of every good software company are a bunch of risk-taking wizards who love to create new games and Rube Goldbergisms, who want to say &quot;Watch This!&quot; and kick back and enjoy the rewards. That's the dream."/>
			<outline text="By investing in Apple, Microsoft became bigger. Every time they make an investment outside of Windows they further isolate Sun and their partners. Sun is trying to concentrate power. Microsoft can disperse power, zig where Sun zags, knowing that they'll be able to gather it thru their developer program and distribution power. Microsoft has the best view of the developer world. A few tweaks, some new 2.0-developer relations features would ice it."/>
			<outline text="***The smart people will figure it out"/>
			<outline text="When they turn the corner it will be about looking outside, beyond the industry faceoffs and PC WEEK headlines. Microsoft's next challenge is to accept and support the cacophony. That's what Sun is forcing them to do, and for that I'm very thankful to Sun!"/>
			<outline text="A friend said, a year ago, when he heard we were porting Frontier to Windows said &quot;God help them!&quot; He was making a joke, of course, but in every joke there's an element of truth. I said to Gates that I wondered if we could build a better relationship with Microsoft than we've been able to get with Apple. There's the challenge, to take what we've learned, both of us, and overcome the public relations fiascos."/>
			<outline text="I told Gates that I had been painted as a villain too. I hated it because I know I'm a good person. I offered my way of working with that, I said just go ahead and do what you would have done if you had everyone's approval. The smart people will figure it out. "/>
			<outline text="Applied to Gates's situation, don't wait for Scott McNealy to get on stage and say he admires you. It may happen, but I wouldn't hold my breath."/>
			<outline text="I think there's no great victory you can have in this life. I used to dream about universal accolades. Now I just hope to have fun and make new friends and laugh a lot. "/>
			<outline text="***Closing words"/>
			<outline text="Before switching to other topics, a note of appreciation for Bill Gates. "/>
			<outline text="It's not uncommon for me to harshly review the actions of powerful people, or ask questions that they don't want to answer. I'm thinking of a broader audience, what do they need to know, it's part of my philosophy of working with other people, having fun. "/>
			<outline text="I often take a personal hit for asking these questions, but not with Bill Gates. Go back and read some of the pieces I've written, like &quot;Bill Gates vs the Internet&quot;, where I asked if Microsoft was obsolete, or &quot;Stalin Go Home!&quot; when I realized it wasn't. "/>
			<outline text="Pretend you're Gates, reading that kind of stuff. Other luminaries ask why they should work with me when I'm so critical of them. I imagine that Gates looks at the world differently. &quot;Is there a way for me to win here?&quot; he asks. If so, he's parses it correctly. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is here to stay. So a win-win pretty much means they win too. Life is too short and Microsoft is too big for me to invest in them losing. It would not be a good bet, even for a huge company like Sun, the odds aren't good!"/>
			<outline text="Some people think Gates lies, but I don't. I think he pays the big price for telling his truth, and he doesn't try to interfere with me telling my truth, unlike some other people. The people who accuse him, generally also accuse me, so there's a clue. "/>
			<outline text="Last night, for example, I posted informal performance results of our not-yet-released Windows software as compared to our Mac software. Under some circumstances the Windows software is much faster. A frequent correspondent writes saying that I'm biased and that something insidious is going on. Jeez! No way. Sure I want the Windows software to be faster. The Mac is too slow. Macs may not get faster. Frontier/Win is my new thing. I want it to be great and I want people to love it. Is that insidious? No way."/>
			<outline text="I think Gates is in a similar place. He points out that he could have faced off with Sun at the start, and refused to sign a Java agreement. It's true. He thought he was doing something good for others in the industry by signing on. No doubt there was a self-serving side to that deal for him. But he's a businessperson, and to expect him to not serve his own interests is to disrespect Gates the busnessman. "/>
			<outline text="It ain't black and white. It's not The Borg or the Evil Empire. Look closer, there's a more interesting story. And Microsoft is making it possible for me to look closer."/>
			<outline text="So, thanks Bill Gates. This may not make me popular with some people, so be it. You're unique in this business. With all possible humility, I hope we can work together. That's my highest praise. Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***Junk email"/>
			<outline text="Shifting gears..."/>
			<outline text="One of the discussions I led in New Orleans was a working session to figure out what to do about junk email. We came up with a bunch of creative solutions. Chris Barr from CNET was taking notes and may write it up, if he does I'll point to his piece from the Scripting News home page."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, here's a technique you can use if a spammer puts an 800-number in email advertising. Give them a call! Learn what they do. Chat for a while. Listen to the pitch. 800-number calls are free for  you! What's your hurry?"/>
			<outline text="The weakness of spam mail is that they need some way to receive a qualified response. They usually don't use email because it's so easy to reverse the flow. A million messages going out might yield a million messages coming back. Ooops."/>
			<outline text="But if they put an 800-number in the ad, there's your opportunity to help them better target their email spam. And whatever you do, never call a 900-number from an email promotion. That would cost *you* money!"/>
			<outline text="***What happened at Agenda?"/>
			<outline text="The Agenda 98 conference starts today in Phoenix, Arizona. I could have participated at Agenda, as I have in the past, by speaking from the audience, asking questions of the people on stage, but after last year's experience, I decided I didn't want to do that, for a variety of reasons, which I want to briefly explain here."/>
			<outline text="First, read &quot;Sept 30 in SF&quot; to see how I feel about microphones and Q&amp;A sessions at conferences. When I line up to speak at a microphone I get nervous, get into my head, the spontaneity is gone, and so is much of the fun, for me."/>
			<outline text="Second, being in the audience makes it hard to do my job. Inevitably the speaker talks down to me (why not, they're on stage, they can't even see me). Larry Ellison was rude and disrespectful last year the one time I spoke. I can shrug it off, but I'm only human, and I prefer not to be put in embarassing situations."/>
			<outline text="Third, I look for ways to earn my presence at conferences by facilitating and performing. Agenda is expensive. I also have a much richer hallway experience if some of my ideas have been aired from the stage. So, while this rule isn't cast in concrete, I prefer to go to conferences that I speak at."/>
			<outline text="To my friends who I will miss, I'm sorry I won't be at Agenda this year! What happened? Send me email. If you want to tell my readers, I'd be happy to carry the message. Send email to dave@scripting.com."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/21/97; 7:36:39 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I was in meetings much of yesterday, but managed to break away several times to read the stories on the web about the Department of Justice action against Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="I've had a chance to talk it over with some friends, and before the meetings start today I want to write down some thoughts about the DoJ action, and also about some of the responses to yesterday's DaveNet piece, &quot;The Man Behind the Curtain&quot;."/>
			<outline text="***The Sun position"/>
			<outline text="Sun's position re Java reminds me of the kind of position an Apple exec (e.g. Sculley or Gasse) might have taken re Microsoft in the late 80s or early 90s, only it's less likely to work now because Microsoft is much more powerful now than they were then; and Sun is much less powerful than Apple was back then."/>
			<outline text="One correspondent asks how I would feel if I had licensed software to Microsoft and they had chosen to leave a crucial suite out of the distribution. Good question! If they had paid me $15 million for the license, I would treat them like a customer, and see how I could work better with them. I remember that the customer is always right. It would take me a very long time, a lot of phone calls and meetings one-one before I would file a lawsuit against a customer."/>
			<outline text="Another email correspondent, a Unix person, considers Microsoft the enemy. By implication, an enemy we share. I don't see it that way. All of a sudden they think we're brothers. Hah! Last year I wrote several open emails to the Sun community, asking them to work with us in the Mac world, to really deliver a great cross-platform Java, and also to make Sun iron and Mac LANs work really well together. You wouldn't have believed the immaturity of some of the responses I got. In trying to get their attention, I warned that if we didn't work together with mutual respect, we would meet up eventually, on Windows."/>
			<outline text="That day has come. The Mac is a shadow of its former market presence. Apple is in disarray. The Mac developer community is in even more disarray. Not wanting to go down with the ship, my company and users, we moved our software Windows. Now I don't care about Sun's cross-platform pitch, or the Unix community's continued unrealistic arrogance. They were never very good at listening. Learn the lesson, guys and gals. What happens when you don't respond to bona fide offers to work with others? You end up isolated."/>
			<outline text="I have no sympathy for the leaders of the Unix crowd. What a wasted opportunity."/>
			<outline text="***The DoJ position"/>
			<outline text="I do sympathize with the US Department of Justice position. I want Netscape to be a continued market presence, if only for the induction step -- if they can do it, it can be done again. Netscape has done a fair-poor job of marshalling a developer community around it, they have wasted a lot of their advantage, but there are sounds coming from Netscape that they want to do better. I support them in this."/>
			<outline text="But the DoJ position is an implementation of something that I don't believe in . There is no line that defines system software. We've been having this argument, in my world, since Apple bundled HyperCard in 1986. HyperCard was an application. They said it was system software, and few people argued, certainly not the DoJ. Disconnect. It killed quite of bit of independent development, just the kind of thing the DoJ should have been interested in, but they didn't protest then so how can they protest now?"/>
			<outline text="Could a web browser be part of Windows? Maybe. Microsoft certainly has integrated it with IE 4.0. I'm leaving it turned on on my Windows machine. At first I thought it was an awful idea, but I'm going to let it stay installed their way for a while, let it sink in and see if I like the idea and how usable that idea is."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft &amp; Restraint"/>
			<outline text="I urge Microsoft to learn restraint."/>
			<outline text="It's going to be a new way of doing business for them."/>
			<outline text="The software industry is precious. It's a free speech area. Yes, Microsoft has the right to bundle whatever they want, in my opinion. Their free speech matters too. In other words, I don't think, on philosophic terms, the DoJ position has much to stand on. "/>
			<outline text="But unless Microsoft shows some restraint on how it expands its system software into areas that others are exploring, and allows something remotely like a level playing field, it's in all our interests that the government attempt to force them to be restrained."/>

			<outline text="The subject of the show was the controversy swirling around the US Department of Justice action against Microsoft on Monday."/>
			<outline text="Here's something I think Rose and the other experts didn't get. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is making a bet that users want the web experience deeply integrated with all aspects of their computer use."/>
			<outline text="Maybe they're wrong?"/>
			<outline text="***Vulnerability"/>

			<outline text="It's been proven that web browsers are great for displaying newspaper and magazine articles, but they are totally unproven as the basic user interface of desktop computers. "/>
			<outline text="Every time the market leader moves there's opportunity in its wake. I wonder if the lawyers understand this?"/>
			<outline text="***History"/>

			<outline text="The switch from the IBM PC to the Mac knocked out 1-2-3 and begat Excel."/>
			<outline text="The switch from MS-DOS to Windows knocked out WordPerfect, and made Microsoft Word the default word processor."/>
			<outline text="The switch from MS-DOS to Windows created an opportunity for Apple, that Apple ignored. (One of the great gaffes of all time. What if the courts had interfered and locked PC users into a character-based interface?)"/>
			<outline text="It hasn't shaken out yet. Microsoft hasn't beaten Netscape. They're still here, it's still true that more people use Netscape's browser than Microsoft's."/>
			<outline text="***OEMs are distributors"/>
			<outline text="DOJ has focused on the OEM agreements that Microsoft has with Dell, Compaq, Gateway, IBM, etc. "/>
			<outline text="A more interesting place to look is the desktop of a user buying a PC or a Mac in mid-late 1998. Microsoft software will be running the desktops of all new PCs and Macs. "/>
			<outline text="Remember the deal that Microsoft did with Apple in August making MSIE the default browser for the Mac. I understand, from sources, that the integration on the Mac desktop will be just as deep on the Mac as on Windows 98."/>
			<outline text="The OEMs, and now Apple, are just distributors. The only interface that matters here is Microsoft's interface with people buying new computers in 1998 and beyond."/>
			<outline text="I say let Microsoft try its grand experiment, and keep your eyes open for new opportunities. They've got to be there! It always works that way."/>
			<outline text="***A message to Washington"/>
			<outline text="Is the DOJ lawsuit the result of lobbying by Netscape and Kleiner Perkins? It seems that way. I don't hear them protesting. "/>
			<outline text="If so, I would much prefer to see them get their butts in gear and start shipping new products on Mac and Windows that deeply excite content developers and web users and people who use desktop systems in homes and offices. "/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Moral Arguments&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/23/97; 6:25:34 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday the earth shook a little. My point of view shifts. The Reuters &lt;a href=&quot;http://biz.yahoo.com/finance/97/10/22/cpq_msft_1.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; quoting a Compaq exec's testimony with the US Department of Justice was a little quake. Then ZDNet had a detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/news/1020/22eoems.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; about Gateway 2000 and Micron. The Microsoft OEMs are talking, they aren't entirely happy with the relationship."/>
			<outline text="A common theme in the email I received yesterday: Microsoft wants it both ways. They want to be able to completely specify the &quot;Windows experience&quot;, to not allow their OEMs to remove or modify the Microsoft web browser and replace it with Netscape's. People say this is a moral contradiction because Microsoft wants exactly that right with Sun's software; they want to edit the &quot;Java Experience&quot; on Windows."/>
			<outline text="There are apparent contradictions elsewhere. If MSIE is part of the operating system, why is it available as an app for Macintosh? Not that I'm complaining, I like MSIE on the Mac, I even use it (it's my default browser). But trying to parse their position to find a consistency, it's something I can't understand, I'm lost. I don't get it."/>
			<outline text="***It's a rough business"/>
			<outline text="When Windows 3.0 shipped in 1990 it wasn't the dominant OS, it wasn't even on the map, and it wasn't even much of an OS, it was a shell on top of MS-DOS with some APIs. Microsoft wanted IBM's support back then, but they had to go it alone because IBM was going with OS/2. Microsoft won, now the world has to deal with their struggle to remain on top. In other words Microsoft had to claw its way to the top and they must continue to claw to stay there."/>
			<outline text="In the Mac world, we learned how rough a business it is this summer when Apple took back licenses from Power Computing, Motorola and IBM. It was good preparation for parsing the controversies in the Windows world this fall. "/>
			<outline text="A sidebar, Steve Jobs may have maneuvered Apple into a more powerful position by regaining exclusive distribution rights to the Mac OS. Since Compaq et al are more vocal and independent now, this may create opportunities for the Mac OS, if Apple is willing to do win-win deals with others."/>
			<outline text="***It's about power"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft doesn't want to hand the keys over to Sun. In yesterday's San Jose Mercury, Gates explains: &quot;Their agenda is anti-PC, ours is pro-PC.&quot; A beautifully concise statement. Since they don't (believe they) have to bend to Sun for economic reasons, they don't. "/>
			<outline text="And they don't want to turn the keys over to Compaq either. The web browser is part of Windows, Microsoft says. If you want to ship a Windows machine, you have to ship it the way we want you to. Compaq could license or create another OS and get out of the Windows business. But as long as they're building Windows machines, they have to do what Microsoft tells them to do, at least until the Justice Department steps in."/>
			<outline text="If you try to parse these events on moral terms, you start spinning way too soon, before you reach a conclusion. The best you can do, I think, is to observe what's changed, and look for opportunities to help change happen in ways that work for you."/>
			<outline text="Further, Microsoft isn't revealing a contradiction, they're clarifying. We're seeing their power more clearly because the licenses and contracts and depositions are becoming public. The history we're seeing goes back quite a few years. The power was always there, it's just being exposed now, and it's stunning."/>
			<outline text="I don't think you can morally judge this, I can't -- I just try to understand, for now."/>
			<outline text="***I wish"/>
			<outline text="But I wish the world worked differently."/>
			<outline text="I wish Compaq could sell whatever they wanted, I wish they could change the software on their hard disks on a daily basis, depending on what customers want, or what they thought customers wanted."/>
			<outline text="But the industry is structured differently. Before Microsoft there was IBM and then DEC, both enormous concentrations of power. For some reason that maybe I'll understand someday, the computer business tends to concentrate power in a single company. It used to revolve around hardware, but now it revolves around software. "/>
			<outline text="Someday maybe the computer world will be driven by personalities and personal reputations as the entertainment world is. People make software and people use it. Someday maybe it will be that simple."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>

			<outline text="In &quot;A Message to Washington&quot;, 10/22/97, among many other things, I asked: &quot;Is the DOJ lawsuit the result of lobbying by Netscape and Kleiner Perkins? It seems that way. I don't hear them protesting.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="From John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins: &quot;It's absolutely, positively not true that Kleiner Perkins has lobbied regarding Microsoft anti-trust issues.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Well I guess that clears it up!"/>
			<outline text="***Apology"/>
			<outline text="First, to John and his partners, I wish I had asked the question more carefully. Some people read that excerpt and assumed the answer to the question was Yes. I didn't know the answer, that's why it was a question, not a statement of fact. "/>
			<outline text="Further, I apologize for going down the &quot;seems&quot; path. I don't like it when people do that to me. It was unfair. "/>
			<outline text="However, at the time, I felt the question deserved asking because KP and the KP companies are becoming more active in Washington, hosting dinners, parties and press events for Senators, members of Congress, the President and Vice-President, often behind closed doors and off the record. What do they talk about? I don't know."/>
			<outline text="Later that day the depositions of execs at Compaq, Micron and Gateway became public, offering a more likely theory as to why the DOJ filed their suit. If the piece had come out later I probably wouldn't have asked the question at all."/>
			<outline text="***Party!"/>
			<outline text="I spoke with Doerr, who lives just three houses down the street, late last night after returning from a Silicon Valley party hosted by Upside magazine. It was a great party,  so elegant, so much food, so many happy people!"/>
			<outline text="The party invite said we had to kiss David Bunnell, the publisher of Upside, so I did! I did it in front of the San Jose Mercury gossip columnist, Chris Nolan; who was stunningly radiant in a boa feather black dress and bright red lipstick."/>
			<outline text="Marney Morris looked like a Kennedy, she's so beautiful. The world is loving her new Sprocketworks encyclopedia for kids, and you can see the glow. She was on ABC Nightline last week!"/>
			<outline text="I met Gary Reback, the crusading attorney who's been working on Washington for years, and now is gaining traction. And I met David Bank, the Wall Street Journal reporter who covers Microsoft (from San Francisco, of all places)."/>
			<outline text="I talked with Elm Yeh, the Taiwan moneyman who was thinking about Apple in the spring, and Karen Katz, who just raised $9 million for her website, thirdage.com. She says she's going to live to be 100! She's only 47 now. What a baby!"/>
			<outline text="Jodi Mardesich, the investigative reporter from the San Jose Mercury, was coy and doing it reallly well, looking like the cat that just ate the canary!"/>
			<outline text="I kissed Lori Fena, the executive director of EFF, I did it publicly! (It was authentic but not encrypted.) We talked about privacy and I suggested we do a live event with interviews and demos and really get the issues out there in a focused way."/>
			<outline text="Oh I know this sounds drippy, but what the heck. It was such a happy party! Everyone seemed to be in love with me. I just spooned it out in huge scoops, and it was delicious!"/>
			<outline text="Thank you Upside for such a colorful experience and a wonderful evening."/>
			<outline text="***One final clarification"/>
			<outline text="At the end of yesterday's &quot;Moral Arguments&quot; I said: &quot;Someday maybe the computer world will be driven by personalities and personal reputations as the entertainment world is. People make software and people use it. Someday maybe it will be that simple.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Ron Lachman, ron@lachman.org, said: &quot;Huh? Steve Jobs. Bill Gates. Larry Ellison, John Doerr. What are you saying here? It already is dominated by personalities.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good point! But how can I respond to this and still be respectful to the men he mentions?"/>
			<outline text="Let's put it this way -- variety is the spice of life. "/>
			<outline text="You're right, personalities do drive the industry (I don't like &quot;dominate&quot;). But most of these guys are singing the same tune. After a bunch of years, breast-beating and fear get pretty boring. I'm hoping for more creativity and fun-having among the personalities of the software biz."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/25/97; 7:18:52 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday, with Microsoft's help, I dropped a juicy tidbit on the web, a copy of a memo from Bill Gates to John Sculley, from the summer of 1985, over twelve years ago."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/specials/gatesLetter/text.html "/>
			<outline text="I wanted it to be on the web. It had already been made public in a book and a magazine. I felt that web journalists could do something interesting with the document, that's why I asked for it. "/>
			<outline text="Some people have speculated that this was a Microsoft-orchestrated posting. It was not. I asked for it, in public, in a DaveNet piece, released on Thursday."/>
			<outline text="Now I'm going to turn the jets in another direction. Here's an invitation to other people who write about computers on the web to take it from here. It would be great if other people would dig into the story and look at the questions it raises."/>
			<outline text="***1985"/>
			<outline text="In 1985 Microsoft had a substantial investment in Mac software. Word and Excel were out. They had shipped a BASIC for the Mac. I think there was a Flight Simulator for the Mac."/>
			<outline text="But the Mac was in trouble. The top of the line was a 512K machine with no easy or reliable expansion. The Mac market was choking with limited memory. The limits wouldn't open until early 1986 when Apple shipped the Mac Plus. It was expandable, you could add a hard disk and you could add several megabytes of RAM. In 1987 the Mac II shipped, opening the Mac to larger screens and color. "/>
			<outline text="As Gates says in the memo, they had lobbied Apple for compatibility at a disk level, with the 3.5 inch format that was just coming out for the PC. I saw it the same way. I wrote a memo to Apple execs in late 1983, before the Mac shipped, asking them to get in synch with the new disk format for the Data General/One, the first PC laptop."/>
			<outline text="According to Gates's memo, the Macintosh XL (Lisa) had just been cancelled. Apple was promoting Lotus Jazz heavily, but Jazz was a dud. This must have frustrated Gates, Lotus was competing with Excel, which (as we know now) would go on to be the market leader in spreadsheets. Lotus was the leader in spreadsheets in 1985. "/>
			<outline text="1985 was the year of the Macintosh Office. Apple was in deep trouble. Jobs was forced out. Sales of the Mac had reduced to a trickle. Apple was surviving on Apple II sales. Mac-only developers were going out of business in 1985. Gates must have seen that in the sales of Word and Excel."/>
			<outline text="Things looked grimmer in the summer of 1985 than they actually were. The Mac Plus was in the pipe. When it shipped, the market would boom. It wasn't clear to me at the time, nor is it clear now, that Apple would have done as well if it had licensed the OS. "/>
			<outline text="As Carlton's book makes agonizingly clear, at the top level Apple was a bozo company. I wonder if the tables had been turned, if Gates had been the CEO of Apple in 1985, if the Mac OS would have been licensed. I believe Apple could have taken and held control of the OS world if someone more aggressive and winning-oriented had been running Apple, instead of Sculley. "/>
			<outline text="Licensing was the small picture, a tactic. The big problem was there was no one home at the top level of Apple, no one who had the Gatesian drive to win, no one with the commitment to help Apple's engineers create products that customers wanted. Any strategy would have been preferable to the no-strategy flip-flops of Apple of the mid-late 80s."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft was a much smaller company than Apple in 1985, it was smaller than Lotus too. Even so, Gates was thinking big. No doubt if Apple had followed the plan in the letter, Microsoft would have prospered. But it was also generous of Gates to make this offer. &quot;You be the platform vendor,&quot; he said to Apple. &quot;I'll make apps.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It was also a brave memo. Gates disses IBM, the technology leader that was losing its way. IBM was Microsoft's most important customer. What else did Gates know at that time? Did he know that IBM was going to try to break the clone business with the Micro-Channel Architecture? "/>

			<outline text="It's very early Tuesday morning. I'm thinking about the stock market. Will it crash today? I hope not!"/>
			<outline text="I'm also thinking about web browsers and platforms and the Department of Justice and Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="***What's just?"/>
			<outline text="In August 1995 I wrote a piece after meeting with Microsoft's lead developer for Internet Explorer. The report from that interview is here:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/95/08/applenetscapeshouldmerge.html "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft clearly stated their intentions over two years ago. In an upcoming version of Windows, web browsing would be integrated into the OS."/>
			<outline text="That left Netscape one option, as I saw it in 1995, buy its own operating system and loyal user base, and build from there. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape's stock was high, Apple's was low. They could have absorbed Apple, kept the good stuff, fixed the bugs, and created a wonderful Internet browsing and content development experience. "/>
			<outline text="I kid you not, the opportunity to unseat Microsoft really was there a couple of years ago."/>
			<outline text="But Netscape pursued another strategy. What was it? I never understood how they could sit by and let the Mac OS wither, when it was their best shot at co-existing with high level Internet services integrated into Windows."/>
			<outline text="***Does Windows require innovation?"/>
			<outline text="Look at the Bookmark Editor in Microsoft Internet Explorer -- it's one of the most awkward outliners I've ever seen. I can hear the Microsoft evangelists saying with glee -- write your own! "/>
			<outline text="That's the idea of Windows 98. HTML rendering is ubiquitous. Every app can become a web browser. If there's some piece of MSIE you think you can do better, offer your own shell."/>
			<outline text="Is this a good thing? Yes it is."/>
			<outline text="***Competing with Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="I wouldn't go into direct competition with Microsoft. I wouldn't try to replace the primary web browser, at least not at this time. But I do site development software, and being able to preview a page as it will look in a web browser is an essential part of using my software. Of course it makes sense to build on the new HTML rendering features in Windows 98."/>
			<outline text="Maybe Microsoft will steal my ideas, so could anyone else, so you keep moving, gather users, earn their loyalty, and hope for the best. Risk is everywhere in business. You can't avoid it, you have to embrace it."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape had options"/>
			<outline text="The Mac OS was much stronger two years ago. Since then, two billion dollars in Apple losses, a radical change in management and direction, and disappearing confidence among users and developers. There's probably still a good reason for Netscape to add emphasis to their Mac direction, but they'll find there are fewer people to work with in the Mac world now, two years later."/>
			<outline text="I want to make this point clearly -- Netscape had options. It was clear two years ago that Microsoft was going to deeply integrate HTML in the OS. You have to think like your competitor to be successful in a software world containing Microsoft. That's good! There was a way to zig to their zag. A win-win could have happened. You can't stand by while your competitor moves forward, you have to move too."/>
			<outline text="The Department of Justice is not acting in our interests by trying to undo thru government muscle what has already been settled in the market. Netscape has no right to access the Windows desktop unless Microsoft wants them to. It's Microsoft's product. Netscape had to earn that right thru the market. "/>
			<outline text="***Competing with Gates"/>
			<outline text="To compete with Gates you have to be super-sharp. Users and developers must demand the same. The cause isn't lost. Web developers may not be universally anti-Microsoft, but there is a lot of energy that's pro-independence. If Netscape crafts an interesting position, they will have support. There must be a hill for Netscape to head for, where they can win and grow outside of the Windows desktop. It's time to think creatively."/>

			<outline text="John Denver sang Thank God I'm a Country Boy."/>
			<outline text="I've been living in Silicon Valley for 18 years. I've been part of two startups, was a developer at one of the earliest software companies, and participated in an IPO."/>
			<outline text="I'm a Silicon Valley Boy, but I'm not sure who to thank!"/>
			<outline text="***Silicon Valley vs Bill Gates"/>
			<outline text="Every few years, since the late 80s when Bill Gates became the largest personality in the business, Silicon Valley has gone to war with him. "/>
			<outline text="Think about Bill Gates. He'll probably be fighting government regulators for the rest of his career. If for no other reason than this, I think diversity matters to him."/>
			<outline text="Then think about us. We want diversity too, but how well organized are we? What are we offering? We're sending a coordinated message to Washington, but how powerful (and empowering) are our messages to each other?"/>
			<outline text="Thru Netscape, yes, we have offered diversity, but on unacceptable terms to Microsoft. Navigator was aimed directly at the heart of Windows, Netscape execs said so in public statements about Windows two years ago. Microsoft heard them. Netscape was doing an end-run around Windows. Microsoft blocked the move, I think effectively. "/>
			<outline text="Every time he's approached this way, you'll get a crushing response from Gates. Frontal assaults don't scare him. It happened with Go and now with Sun and Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="You have to build on his stuff, not incite the press to write &quot;The End of Microsoft&quot; pieces, and develop a loyal and happy following among users, and then maybe he won't attempt a crush. "/>
			<outline text="(Examples: Adobe, Cisco, Intel, Intuit.)"/>
			<outline text="***Netscape vs Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="To the Silicon Valley VCs, the next time you start a company to stand alongside Microsoft, make that position clear from the start. "/>
			<outline text="If Netscape had done this, they would have emphasized that Navigator is a Windows application, not a new desktop. "/>
			<outline text="The odd thing is that Netscape *did* build on Microsoft's stuff, but the public hype didn't emphasize that."/>
			<outline text="***Silicon Valley vs Nobody"/>
			<outline text="We've been effective at creating IPOs here in Silicon Valley. We probably create as many millionaires here as they do at Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="But Microsoft programmers have something we don't have in the valley -- leverage. Connections between products. A browser that can also be a help system or a user interface. A content tool that can invoke a runtime. "/>
			<outline text="At Microsoft programmers can work together because they all work at the same company. But Silicon Valley programmers often don't work together, for reasons I don't fully understand."/>
			<outline text="In Silicon Valley we have something that they don't have inside Microsoft -- competition. We already have diversity, we just have to let different approaches have a chance. Its been a closed, exclusive club here. Let's open it up, let the technology and the users drive us, just like it drives people at Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="Silicon Valley has gotten a reputation for being anti-Microsoft. That doesn't serve our interests. To win, we must be good at diversity. We can't make it work without respecting Microsoft. And it can't work until we respect each other."/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="I posted an early draft of this piece on the Scripting News website mid-day Sunday, but I took it down because I wanted to think a little before sending it out. "/>
			<outline text="I'm glad I did that, because it'll work better if I introduce it."/>
			<outline text="***To Frontier/Mac users"/>
			<outline text="First, we're fully committed to producing a Mac version of Frontier 5. The public alpha for the Mac has already been released. We've been using it for about a month to produce our websites, with few glitches or problems."/>
			<outline text="Further, the development of the Windows software is making the Mac software better. One of the major complaints has been that Frontier is too difficult. Both versions are getting simpler because of the experience we're getting with Windows. "/>
			<outline text="***Working on Windows"/>
			<outline text="I've become a full-time Windows user. I'm getting most of my mail here, doing most of my writing, and web browsing too. It's strange but wonderful. New neural pathways. All my cards in the air. Wheee! I can feel myself getting smarter. I like it."/>
			<outline text="Frontier on Windows is really fast and it's simple! It's allowing me to see the essence of what Frontier is, in a way that I've never been able to see before. Back when the Mac version was this lean, I didn't know Frontier that well. Now I live and breathe it."/>
			<outline text="I get a chance to refocus it. A new formula, powerful cross-platform web scripting. Automated site management is what we do. The user interface reforms around a different mission from the one we launched on the Mac in the early 90s, before the web happened."/>
			<outline text="My software feels new again! Most of the mouse actions are the same but the ones that are different are incredibly annoying. The keystrokes are all wrong. The Alt-keys feel good, the Control-keys don't, and the mixture of the two feels worse."/>
			<outline text="***Old pathways never die"/>
			<outline text="New neural pathways are forming, and old ones are falling into the background. But I learned that the old pathways never die. The base of my spine knows how to use the outliner in Frontier/Win. Why? I used to use a PC as my primary computer, and we kept keystroke-compatible every step along the way as we moved to the Mac, and now back to the PC. Alt-UDRL. Ten years later, my brain remembers how to work Frontier, as if it were the PC version of ThinkTank or Ready! Wow."/>
			<outline text="But problems that used to fade into the background are right in my face. I see why people are confused when they first look at Frontier. I'm motivated to fix the problems. "/>
			<outline text="***More experiments"/>
			<outline text="And while Windows is a bit frustrating, it's also got some things that I really like. With IE 4.0 installed, each folder displays in a web browser window. This makes previewing a website really interesting. Click on the file in the &quot;Explorer&quot; and it displays as a mini-web page."/>
			<outline text="But networking is slow on Windows! I have two NT machines, one a server, one a workstation. Just opening a folder can take 15 seconds, and the delay is unpredictable. Since my Mac can access the same server, I often use it to browse the other NT machine, it's a lot faster as a client, for some reason that I don't understand and didn't expect."/>
			<outline text="There are some deal-stoppers in the Windows version that keep me from doing work on the scripting.com website from the Windows machine. I'm writing this on the Windows machine, but it will go out thru the Mac, where I have the best connection to the website for authoring. "/>
			<outline text="I've written a script that's designed to run on either machine. Cross-platform scripts are no longer a dream, I'm doing it. I start giggling sometimes. I'll probably read this two months from now and think it was silly to say that."/>
			<outline text="***Losing the label"/>
			<outline text="The biggest bit of liberation comes from leaving the loser's world behind. I'm not calling names, I own that label as much as any other Mac user, and I received it as a gift from some scared people who didn't want to look into the Mac community. "/>
			<outline text="But the barriers are on both sides. Now I really retch when I see &quot;Windoze&quot; in people's emails. What are they holding onto? Why aren't they willing to try a new way of doing things? If the Explorer is confusing compared to the Finder, why isn't some software entrepreneur taking advantage of that?"/>
			<outline text="These are serious questions. Is it really because Microsoft wants it that way, or do we? I was talking to a VP at Netscape last week; he said that the largest group of Navigator users are on Windows 3.1. If that's true, Microsoft isn't all-powerful in this market. It's now over two years since the shipment of Windows 95. A lot of those 3.1 users upgraded to Netscape's browser before they upgraded to Microsoft's new user interface and Win32 compatibility."/>
			<outline text="What's really going on?"/>
			<outline text="***Myths and fear"/>
			<outline text="For the last few weeks in DaveNet I've made a point of looking into some of the myths of the software world, specifically the belief of many people that Microsoft is responsible for all the problems. "/>
			<outline text="But Bill Gates isn't who everyone thinks he is. Just listen to what he says and read his email, and take him at face value. I have long believed that his reputation doesn't explain who he is, that his actions are different from what many people predict."/>
			<outline text="***Neural pathways"/>
			<outline text="Try an experiment. The next time you're standing at a curb waiting for a light to change, notice which foot you step out with . You'll probably see that it's always the same foot. With me it's my right foot."/>
			<outline text="OK, take a deep breath. Next time lead with the other foot. It may be hard to do, it was for me. Keep doing it the wrong way. It hurts! The pain comes from breaking a well-ingrained habit. "/>
			<outline text="These are called neural pathways. Psychologists say that breaking these habits makes you smarter! Want more evidence of how powerful neural pathways are? Try Don's Amazing Puzzle again:"/>

			<outline text="She said Then that's exactly what we're going to do! "/>
			<outline text="Friends can support other friend's fears, but that isn't being much of a friend. So, to the extent that you consider me a friend, please consider this. If you've been holding out on giving Windows a chance, go ahead and do it."/>
			<outline text="If I can, so can you!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>

			<outline text="If you talk to them, two or three sentences later they will try to sell you something. A trip down a river to a waterfall. Or ganga, the local marijuana, or sex with their girlfriend; or maybe some fruit or meat. Sell sell sell. They have something they want you to buy."/>
			<outline text="The beach rastas in Jamaica are hustlers, they're a little charming at first, until you realize that they aren't really being friendly, they just want to sell you something."/>
			<outline text="***Back to software!"/>

			<outline text="What conclusion are we supposed to draw? That they have some secret sauce at Sun that makes their Java run faster? Could it be true? Well, no. In the real world, Java apps won't run any faster on Sun hardware than on others, even if the tests say they will."/>
			<outline text="***Fudge"/>
			<outline text="Here's how Sun fudged the test. A user asks Java to do something. Instead of just doing it, Sun's Java asks who's asking. If the answer is Pendragon, they don't bother doing the work, they just return the correct answer. It's not surprising that they can do this fifty percent faster than if they had actually done the work. "/>
			<outline text="Surely the tests could be more rigorous, I'm sure they will be, but here's another point of view: Sun could be honest."/>
			<outline text="***Analogy"/>
			<outline text="Here's a reasonably close analogy from education. Imagine a teacher asking a student to do a homework assignment. The student wants to get the assignment finished as quickly as possible, and doesn't care about being honest. "/>
			<outline text="The teacher doesn't really care what the answer is, presumably the teacher could do the calculations without asking the student. The teacher wants the student to do the work. The student wants to get a good grade without doing the work."/>
			<outline text="***The importance of testing"/>
			<outline text="As we advance technologically, we depend on testing to keep us safe. "/>
			<outline text="New drugs have to go thru long expensive tedious trials. Cars have to be crash-tested. We don't tolerate fraud in product testing in drugs and cars, should we tolerate it in software? No we shouldn't, if only because someday a car or a drug might rely on software as part of a testing process. Or a moon mission, or your tax return."/>
			<outline text="Computers are everywhere. We need to trust the people who make computers to have a high level of integrity. We want meaningful comparisons, and if a bit of software is slow or unreliable, we want to know before we bet our money or careers or safety on it."/>
			<outline text="Caught in the act, Sun says this is just the way business works. "/>
			<outline text="They want to run the benchmarks well, they say. "/>

			<outline text="***Quiet on Scripting News"/>
			<outline text="It's been pretty quiet on my home page for a week or so. There are a couple of reasons for this."/>
			<outline text="First, there's not that much that interests me happening on other websites. I get my stimulation, much of the time, from outside. On TV, Saddam Hussein is grabbing the cursor, again, and I tune out when that happens. Let me know if anything important happens there."/>
			<outline text="It's raining in California, but it does that every year. I put in a new office roof this summer, a radical departure from past roofs. This one is peaked. It's a rational design. The old roof was flat, the gutters would get clogged, and the roof would leak, all over my servers! This morning, it's raining cats and dogs outside, but we're dry! I like it."/>
			<outline text="The second reason for the quiet is that I'm deep in the Frontier 5 cleanup. We have a new piece of software, the Windows version, and I'm totally delighted and intrigued. It's a new thing. It's fast! It seems like CISC had some advantages over RISC. Our scripts run as fast as C code ran just a couple of years ago. Scripts that used to do 1000 loops in a second, now do 10,000 loops. Page rendering happens virtually instantaneously. "/>
			<outline text="The scripts run fast, but my brain has to slow down because new neural pathways are forming. So instead of gliding at a super high level, I'm seeing more of the work, and less of the picture. Luckily this hiatus is coming at a time when the industry is a little slower. "/>
			<outline text="It's part of the digging process. We're building a big jet (this is how I visualize it) that can fly 500 people from New York to London. But first we have to fly from Houston to Austin with a small crew. One step at a time, diggin all the way. At the end of the trip we fly a little higher, maybe much higher."/>
			<outline text="***Flat roofs"/>
			<outline text="My old flat roof had a skylight. Now I have a skylight into my attic. A friend laughed, probably thought it was stupid, until I told him how it came to be. "/>
			<outline text="My old software, Frontier 4, has skylights too! How did they come to be? It doesn't matter because we're editing them out. I'm not in the house business, but I take software seriously. "/>
			<outline text="So we're taking the time to get many braincell burners out before we release the Windows software publicly. "/>
			<outline text="***Windows peeves"/>
			<outline text="A peeve about Windows. I wish there was an menu command to close all windows belonging to an app without bringing each one to the front and clicking on the close box. "/>
			<outline text="A random thought, there are advantages to the much-maligned &quot;MDI&quot; interface style on Windows. It's the way apps like Word, Excel and Eudora manage their windows, inside one big window. MDI makes it possible to easily move all the windows of a single app out of the way. "/>
			<outline text="And if all apps were MDI, the task bar at the bottom of the screen would actually work. As it stands now, the non-MDI apps clutter the task bar at the bottom of the screen. Nine out of ten items in the list are windows that I wished I could get rid of! Ooops. The UI doesn't work."/>
			<outline text="(The two biggest offenders on my system are the file system Explorer and the Internet Explorer, both from Microsoft.)"/>
			<outline text="Another big complaint of this Windows newbie is Where is the Apps menu? No, the task manager isn't what I want. I want an icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Pull it down, see a list of each of the apps. Choose the app and all its windows come to the front. "/>
			<outline text="Like a mature person who just lost a limb, I still reach out for the Apps menu, even though on Windows it's not there."/>
			<outline text="Oh well."/>
			<outline text="***Opportunity missed"/>
			<outline text="If Mac System 8 hadn't used the Control key for popup menus, which many people seem to like, I would have suggested mapping the Control right on to the Cmd key."/>
			<outline text="That way the keystrokes for managing the clipboard and windows would be identical on both platforms, and people could be cross-platform more easily. "/>
			<outline text="For example, I find myself typing Control-V on my Mac to paste. "/>
			<outline text="It would have delighted me if it worked. "/>
			<outline text="***Windows newbies"/>
			<outline text="We're thinking of starting a new mailing list called Windows-Newbies. It would be for Mac users who are learning to use Windows. "/>
			<outline text="Is there enough interest to support such a mailing list? "/>
			<outline text="Send email to webmaster@scripting.com if you would subscribe and/or contribute. Brent Simmons, our webmaster, will read this mail."/>
			<outline text="***An industry event later today"/>
			<outline text="I'm attending today's Apple event at Flint Center in Cupertino and will be at the press lunch."/>
			<outline text="There are lots of rumors, I believe some and wonder about others. Apple is definitely starting a new process for selling hardware. Look at their home page today for a great teaser."/>
			<outline text="Will they be merging with Oracle? Honestly, I believe that eventually they will. If not today, next time or the time after that. "/>
			<outline text="I'll keep my eyes and ears open today, maybe ask a couple of questions, and let you know what was interesting about the announcements."/>

			<outline text="PPS: I would have asked Jobs these questions, but he didn't show up at the press conference. There were a lot of heavy hitters there, probably like me, expecting something more exciting. Next time he predicts an earth-shaking event, it will be worth a grain of salt. Boring news may make Apple healthy, but it doesn't keep reporters in business."/>

			<outline text="What happens when two columnists go to dinner?"/>
			<outline text="Two columns, of course!"/>
			<outline text="***Chris Nolan"/>
			<outline text="On Wednesday evening I had dinner with Chris Nolan, the gossip columnist at the San Jose Mercury-News; at Siam Garden, in Menlo Park, CA."/>
			<outline text="We talked about lots of things, including an odd phenomenon -- there are lots of programmers who think the US Department of Justice (DOJ) action against Microsoft isn't the right thing to do."/>
			<outline text="I talked with Chris, thinking I wouldn't do a column on this subject at this time, but this morning, working on my Windows machine, I had some new thoughts that I wanted to add to the discussion."/>
			<outline text="***How platforms work"/>
			<outline text="First, let's talk philosophy. There's no actual line between system and application software. No rule to allow one to determine if a bit of code is system code or application code. "/>
			<outline text="Also, with history as a guide, it's inevitable that an OS will assume features of its most popular applications. What once was a third party opportunity becomes a feature of the system. If you look at history, you'll see clearly that that's how it always goes. "/>
			<outline text="It happens with applications too. Look at PageMaker and Quark XPress, PhotoShop and Director. They all have become platforms. They have developers of plug-ins, add-ons, filters and extras. They all have philosophies for dealing with thorny issue of moving the platform forward and preserving the investment of developers. "/>
			<outline text="The idea of a single level of platform is naive. Read &quot;What is a Platform?&quot; 8/22/95, for details."/>
			<outline text="It's actually a hierarchy of platforms. Microsoft must support all the other platforms that are built on their platform. Why? They must try to get them to move forward with them. If they fail to get them to move, they're screwed! Microsoft gets this. I wish the DOJ got it too."/>
			<outline text="***A new point of view for me"/>
			<outline text="Now I'm learning the point of view of a developer for a Microsoft platform. "/>
			<outline text="In twenty years of programming, this is the first time for me. (In the 80s when I developed for PCs, Microsoft shared the platform vendor position with IBM.)"/>
			<outline text="I have a reasonably fresh point of view on this. "/>
			<outline text="***We want it"/>
			<outline text="Here's a restatement of the question Chris and I were dealing with..."/>
			<outline text="Why do (some) developers think the DOJ is off the wall in trying to keep Microsoft from shipping HTML rendering in the next release of Windows?"/>
			<outline text="Because we want the feature. "/>
			<outline text="HTML display windows belong in all apps. HTML is very important. Having it implemented underneath the apps, so they can call it thru a system API, will allow us to move our products where customers want them to move."/>
			<outline text="We create work environments for web developers. In some sense, so does everyone else these days. Right now the connection between our environment and the HTML display is klunky. By building it into the OS, Microsoft gives us the power to go around the klunky connection, and make our own vision render itself in HTML."/>
			<outline text="Movement is what our business is about. Somehow the DOJ wants Microsoft to stop moving, but if they do that, we have to stop moving too. "/>
			<outline text="Not good!"/>
			<outline text="***We're flexible"/>
			<outline text="We understand that a lot of web developers prefer using Netscape's browser."/>
			<outline text="So we will support their APIs too."/>
			<outline text="In a sense this makes Netscape an OS vendor too."/>
			<outline text="And that's OK with me!"/>
			<outline text="(In fact I like it.)"/>
			<outline text="***A jihad?"/>
			<outline text="Instead of trying to stop Microsoft from moving forward, couldn't Netscape, IBM, Sun, Oracle etc. make a more attractive proposition to developers than Microsoft makes?"/>
			<outline text="Couldn't we have diversity? If Microsoft is so strong, it seems that the other actual or would-be OS vendors could make different, perhaps more generous, offers to smaller developers."/>
			<outline text="So far the propositions have been clumsy, and not respectful. McNealy asks us to sign up for a jihad against Microsoft. No! Try again?"/>

			<outline text="It's been quiet on Scripting News, as we take apart our Mac web development system and put it back together as a cross-platform system. "/>
			<outline text="In October we started using the Windows software to manage the home page and mail pages on the scripting.com site. In November we smoothed things out so we're almost ready to release a public beta. "/>
			<outline text="Almost! I keep wondering how close to perfection it will have to get before I'm willing to let it be judged. All I can say is now we're close. A little more pushing and a public beta will ship. "/>
			<outline text="On Saturday we got somewhere we've wanted to be for about a year and a half. We produced a new test release of Frontier, version 5.0a18, that runs on both Mac and Windows. That was a major milestone!"/>
			<outline text="***Write once run anywhere"/>
			<outline text="Write once run anywhere is not our marketing slogan (it's Java's), but it could be. We have a large body of scripts, ones that manage the file system and local area network, ones that produce web content and manage sites, that don't care what operating system they're running on. "/>
			<outline text="They can do deeply powerful things on Macs, and while it's more limited on Windows, if you have a high-end machine, we run incredibly fast on relatively inexpensive desktop or notebook hardware. "/>
			<outline text="You can build Mac-only LANS with our software, or Windows-only LANs, or you can mix and match. You can do your base work on a Mac desktop but take it on the road with a ThinkPad. "/>
			<outline text="We think this reflects where the creative geek community will be in early 1998. We can make it safe to work on a Mac, because any day  you can move your site to Windows, learn how the keyboard works, and move on from there, with nary a glitch."/>
			<outline text="Or we could return the favor and offer Windows and Unix based web developers new reasons to respect the Macintosh. (I'm even more stubborn than people give me credit for!)"/>
			<outline text="***Comparing platforms"/>
			<outline text="A couple of weeks ago, when I saw how fast Frontier is on my 200Mhz Dell box, knowing that 300Mhz machines are now available, I thought I would never use my PowerMac 9500 again, the performance difference is that great, it's so stunning."/>
			<outline text="One tester said that launching Frontier on Windows is so fast, it's like doing a Get Info in the Finder on the Mac. He's so right! "/>
			<outline text="But Saturday, doing work on the Mac, I understood in a new way, how much deeper the web scripting culture is on the Mac. I included three menus, one for the Finder and one for MSIE and Netscape, filled with scripts that have no counterparts on Windows. "/>
			<outline text="I could have included glue for Eudora and a shared menu there too. The connection to web servers is there on the Mac, not yet on Windows. Today, websites are still LANs, so the Macs will continue to play a significant role in our websites for some time."/>
			<outline text="***I use both systems without fear"/>
			<outline text="We're quieter than Java, but we share the same cross-platform religion. "/>
			<outline text="I've come up with a new tagline in the footnote at the bottom of each of our web pages: &quot;At the moment we're using {platformLink ()} to work on this website.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="The stuff inside the curly braces is a macro. If the page is generated on a Mac, it links to macos.apple.com. If it's generated on a PC, it links to an appropriate page on www.microsoft.com. "/>
			<outline text="I use both systems without fear. I've made the investment in Windows, both in paying for the port of the base software, and in mastering the Control key and MDI and other Windowsisms. "/>
			<outline text="It's a bit of a pain, being bi-platform, but at this time, it's worth it."/>
			<outline text="***Adam Bosworth"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I met with Adam Bosworth, adamb@microsoft.com. "/>
			<outline text="I've known Adam for many years, since he developed the beautiful Reflex database at a startup he founded in the mid 80s; as he moved to Borland to work on Quattro and Paradox; and then to Microsoft to do Access and lead the development of Dynamic HTML."/>
			<outline text="Now he's working on XML. At the beginning of the meeting I said I was unimpressed with XML. But I wondered if someone could do an application with XML that was interesting and exciting. "/>
			<outline text="Carefully and slowly Adam sketched his vision of big databases communicating with modestly powerful clients, allowing users to access and update information thru a web browser interface. In his picture, data flows from server to client and back to the server, thru text files in XML syntax to represent the data being transmitted."/>
			<outline text="Adam wanted to meet because he felt our object database could be good client and mid-level server software in the system he's designing. Without a doubt, it could. "/>
			<outline text="We have an almost-perfect structure, managed by an outliner that keeps getting better, for modeling the kind of information that needs to flow thru his XML interfaces. We could perform storage and provide programming interfaces for working on his data in lots of different places. "/>
			<outline text="***Similar visions"/>
			<outline text="Our interest in this has less to do with Adam's vision, and more to do with an opportunity we see to merge the worlds of email, the web and databases. "/>
			<outline text="The need is felt right here on my dual (sometimes dueling!) desktops. Email is almost useless, the web is easy but the two flows don't work together. What's needed? What we got, almost. (We need to implement indexing for our database.)"/>
			<outline text="Technologists who want to catch up, I've written about this stuff in several previous DaveNet pieces, including &quot;Sandboxes&quot;, 4/9/97, and &quot;Fat Web Pages&quot;, 3/26/97. "/>
			<outline text="Our &quot;fat&quot; format could easily turn into XML, and if that happens, it would immediately be compatible with the data modeling schemes that Microsoft and perhaps others are contemplating. They could use our technology to solve their problems, and we could add anything they develop to enhance our system."/>
			<outline text="As stated many, many times in DaveNet, our religion includes working with others. We'll work with anyone who's doing excellent stuff and is willing to invest alongside us in compatibility and moving each other forward. In other words, I don't mind empowering Microsoft if they're willing to empower me."/>
			<outline text="***Thanksgiving 1997!"/>
			<outline text="Switching gears..."/>
			<outline text="Thanksgiving is a big holiday, a uniquely United States event, like July 4 or Memorial Day, but even bigger. People get on planes, travel across the country to be with people in their families. It's a time to put differences aside, even if only for the moment, and give thanks for what is. The expansionist spirit of the United States meets Buddhism! "/>
			<outline text="Thanksgiving is a positive holiday. The glass is half full! A fire in the fireplace, a full belly, the people who raised you, or who you grew up with, or who you're raising, close by. A chance to look them in the eye, raise a glass, and say thanks."/>
			<outline text="Did they have Thanksgivings during the Great Depression or the Civil War or two world wars? Yes, I think so. Were people any less grateful during times of strife than times of prosperity? If they were playing by the rules of Thanksgiving, not. "/>
			<outline text="No one is less deserving on Thanksgiving. Rich people serve food to homeless people. We put aside our normal hierarchy and look for the person, not the bank account, house, car, education, spouses, children."/>
			<outline text="So, whoever you really are, Happy Thanksgiving..."/>

			<outline text="***Iacobucci"/>
			<outline text="Last night I celebrated the first shipment of Frontier 5/Win with an appropriate old friend, Ed Iacobucci, the chairman and founder of Citrix. I've known Ed since he was a lead developer on OS/2 at IBM in the mid-80s, when I was a Mac-and-PC developer. "/>
			<outline text="He showed up on the very day when we shipped our first public alpha for Windows. Ed must be an angel, sent to welcome me back to my old family. It was a random event!

			<outline text="Citrix is an example of a company that has thrived in (sometimes very competive) collaboration with Microsoft. I didn't know that Citrix has a market capitalization greater than Novell's (that didn't really surprise me) or greater than Netscape's (that did)."/>
			<outline text="Ed and I agree on many things, but the biggest thing we agree on is that we both win if we empower each other.

I hope we can empower each other."/>
			<outline text="***Empowerment"/>
			<outline text="Empowerment is my big word for 1997 and maybe 1998. "/>
			<outline text="In November, at a group meeting of my five-person development team, I realized that people weren't empowered to solve problems. We all saw lots of problems in the work we were doing, and in the ways we were working together, but no one was empowered to fix the problems."/>

At one point Doug Baron, the lead developer of the Frontier kernel said &quot;It couldn't ship until you took charge.&quot; But in a similar way it couldn't ship until Doug took charge. And Brent, and Bob, and Wesley. Each of us has to own what we own, and work with and promote to the people who use our stuff. It's a simple idea, but it wasn't happening."/>
			<outline text="There are still glitches, some disconnects; but everyone will get with the program. Empowerment is how respect is implemented within the framework of a software company. Without empowerment you have nothing. With it, you can go somewhere. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;I empower you to fix that bug!&quot; I say to one of my team. We laugh. What does it mean? You are responsible for fixing the bug, I need the fix, but you can do it however you like, in your style. It's OK to have fun. Let's not do a death march. Let's be great."/>
			<outline text="That's what empowerment means to me."/>
			<outline text="***Community"/>
			<outline text="A collection almost 200 people, known as the Frontier-work list, helped us test the first cross-platform versions of Frontier 5. We started this test group just as the empowerment idea was taking hold inside UserLand. "/>
			<outline text="Almost immediately I saw that we had a problem, the requests for features were coming faster than we could process them. We didn't have enough people to understand and respond to the requests. It had been a long time since we had turned our attention in their direction, and once they had it, they weren't going to let us go without being heard."/>
			<outline text="I had enormous resistance to hearing what they were saying. Maybe what they were saying changed while we were going thru my resistance? I don't know. But I know it had a happy outcome, and not surprisingly the same concept that worked so well for the internal UserLand team worked on the mail list too -- empowerment."/>
			<outline text="We have so much at stake in empowering Phil Suh, Jim Roepcke, Preston Holmes,  Philippe Martin, Richard Clark, and the other young red meat eaters who love Frontier as much as we do. We want to learn how to give them what they ask for. We commit to listening now and continuing to listen in the future and looking for opportunities for us to move forward together."/>
			<outline text="In return, we ask for their patience. In many ways they know more about our product than we do. It's going to take some time for us to catch up with them."/>
			<outline text="One result of this new empowerment is a hierarchic attribute for Frontier-managed websites called #pageHeader. It's a simple idea, implemented in about 10 lines of UserTalk code, but it opens up our sites to DHTML, CSS, XML, and lots of other coool Internet acronyms. "/>
			<outline text="We learned that our users are persistent, courageous, seductive, polite and respectful, and they are right! Should we empower them? Of course! Why? Because their success is our success. It's simple."/>
			<outline text="***Canada Appreciation Day"/>
			<outline text="Every year I write a Thanksgiving piece, and every year I get emails from Canadians saying that they own the holiday as much as people in the US."/>
			<outline text="I understand their point of view, but being a US citizen, as I am, I see it as our holiday, and the Canadian Thanksgiving as something different. But I wondered if we could do something to empower our cousins in the north? Then I came up with this idea -- Canada Appreciation Day!"/>
			<outline text="Here's how it would work. Pick a day. On that day, we have huge rallies in US cities, with bright red Maple Leaf flags flying everywhere. We learn about and celebrate our Canadian friends."/>
			<outline text="On Canada Appreciation Day we look to the north, and thank the better half of North America for putting up with our self-centered approach for so long. We ask them how we could do better. And we listen! We try to imagine what life would be like without Canada, and be glad that we don't have to find out."/>
			<outline text="***Self-appointed cops"/>
			<outline text="Today's New York Times has a great editorial about free speech on the Internet."/>
			<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/library/review/120797internet-review.html "/>
			<outline text="After a week of hearing from people gathered around Al Gore who think that the number one issue is protecting children from sexuality, it's refreshing to hear a vote for free speech."/>
			<outline text="After free speech on the net was ratified by the US Supreme Court last summer, there's no doubt that another attack is coming, and the rallying cry, as always, is that the Internet must be made safe for adults who don't want children to learn about human sexuality."/>
			<outline text="Children are interested in sex. That will always be true. So what? Should the net be turned into a sanitized Disney interpretation of the net? No way. I prefer my coffee caffeinated, and I like my net with free speech -- for good reason. I like real things, not simulated things."/>
			<outline text="Instead of hiding from the sexuality of children, we should celebrate it. Let's have puberty parties! Let's have sexuality websites designed just for kids! Hey, kids are great. Their sexuality is great too."/>
			<outline text="***A family charter"/>
			<outline text="As a child, one adult I listened to was our family cleaning lady, Mary. I remember what she looked like and how she spoke. A thin, serious, nicely-dressed black woman, very dignified, and very respectful. And she told me something I'll never forget. "/>
			<outline text="Mary had two children. She told me about them. &quot;Be nice to your sister,&quot; she would say to her son, &quot;she's going to be your friend for your whole life. I won't be here forever.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Today I realize that she loved her children in the true way a mother loves her children -- with an exit strategy. She set it up so her children would know that she wanted them to create their own lives, together, not to live a life she designed for them. Her kids were lucky!"/>
			<outline text="***A charter for siblings"/>
			<outline text="Finally, a message from uncle Dave, to brothers and sisters everywhere. "/>
			<outline text="It's traditional in some families to wait until parents die before becoming friends with our siblings. I've seen this happen in my own family and others. My hope is that you don't have to repeat this in your lives. I want you to know that you can be free no matter what your parents do or say. You can be friends!"/>
			<outline text="Brothers and sisters, you probably know each other better than anyone else. Listen to yourselves and each other. If you're angry with your sister, tell her why. If your sister is angry with you, don't defend against it. That can be hard to do, but if you can, just listen and accept what she said, knowing that it's her point of view, not a condemnation of you as a person."/>
			<outline text="And this is the simplest, most pure empowerment possible. I empower you to be who you really are, not who I want you to be! To say what you see, not what you think I want you to see. That's what friendship is about. That's what power is about too."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/13/97; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I was the biggest XML skeptic. Now I'm not."/>
			<outline text="The press reports say that XML will make the web searchable. But, that's not what it's about! Let me explain... "/>
			<outline text="XML will clean up the HTML mess, but it will have to do this incrementally. It also will be the common transport format between databases running on all platforms. That's huge! And it will be the common, open, discoverable, file format for applications running on desktops. Once stuff is stored in XML nothing can be hidden."/>
			<outline text="Something amazing is happening here. A bunch of letting go. Hey, everyone's missing the story. Here it is!"/>
			<outline text="***Hand-coded XML"/>
			<outline text="One thing that clearly is going to happen with XML is that the browsers from Microsoft and Netscape will support an XML syntax that does the same thing as HTML."/>
			<outline text="The web developer has his or her choice. Code in HTML, that'll work; or code in XML. I expect that the current HTML syntax will be supported forever, and that new features will have to be added to both formats for quite some time."/>
			<outline text="This allows the web browser makers to fix bugs. There are some strange HTML constructs they support. Both Netscape and Microsoft should use this opportunity to tighten things up. It'll make it easier to move forward if they don't accept illegal XML constructs."/>
			<outline text="People will hand-code XML, and new hand-coding tools are possible."/>
			<outline text="***Sidebar"/>
			<outline text="This is a scalable content issue. It pays to separate content from form, so that you can render as HTML or XML depending on what kind of browser is being used. "/>
			<outline text="It's like the Year 2000 problem, something to worry about, something to think about, something to plan for. Soon the browsers are going to understand XML. Will the tools you use make the transition?"/>
			<outline text="***Machine-generated XML"/>
			<outline text="XML will also be used as a transport system for objects between databases. In this case, human beings never see the XML, it's generated by software, and on the other end, it's turned into database structures, again by software."/>
			<outline text="No doubt Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Informix, Sybase, Acius, Claris, et al are wiring up their databases to send and receive XML.This gives us a transport method between databases across platforms. That's pretty exciting!"/>
			<outline text="***XML as an interapplication format"/>
			<outline text="Last week Microsoft announced that the applications in the Office suite will be storing their files in XML in the next release. That got my interest into super high gear. "/>
			<outline text="This is going to be cleaner and faster than the object model we use on the Mac. Send a request for an object to the app and it sends back the XML code. Then we invisibly turn that into a table structure. You walk the structure, get what you want, and then send back the result, using XML, of course. Makes sense to me."/>
			<outline text="And don't miss this, Microsoft is opening up their file formats. They can't hide anything in XML, it's all there to be seen and parsed by other apps. Up till now there was no way to do an Excel-compatible spreadsheet, one that could read and write Excel files. Now there will be nothing in the way."/>

			<outline text="Everyone talks in hushed tones about XML. Shhh. It's exciting! But what does it do?"/>
			<outline text="I can't get involved with something without immediately trying to ground it with an application. How else could I know if it's worth exploring?"/>
			<outline text="Luckily, I had an application waiting for XML."/>
			<outline text="***siteChanges.xml"/>
			<outline text="Jump to this page, and if necessary, view source to see a real application of XML."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/siteChanges.xml "/>
			<outline text="A scheduled script produces that file, running every night at 12 midnight Pacific. It scans our server for new pages, or pages that were modified in the last 24 hours. "/>
			<outline text="A search engine like Alta Vista, InfoSeek, Newsbot or Excite could read this page every night at 9AM GMT. They wouldn't have to crawl the whole site to find the pages that changed, as they do now, they could just load the pages that have changed since the last time they visited."/>
			<outline text="***How was the file generated?"/>
			<outline text="It doesn't matter! "/>
			<outline text="One bit of software can talk to another, and all they need to agree about is the format of the data they want to exchange. There's nothing interesting about how the information is generated (mod dates are a common feature of all current operating systems). What matters is that there's a format that can be understood on all operating systems."/>
			<outline text="So even if we use PERL running on Solaris to create the XML-based info, you can read it on Windows 95 running Microsoft Access, or on an IBM mainframe running Oracle, or Rhapsody running Sybase, or an ancient CP/M box running dBASE II. "/>
			<outline text="It doesn't matter. That's the magic of XML."/>
			<outline text="***It's about relationships"/>
			<outline text="XML allows sites to easily establish an ongoing relationship with search engines. Each machine does what it's good at doing. Network traffic is minimized. The best picture of our site assembles itself on the search engine server."/>
			<outline text="On our LAN it's easy and fast to find all the pages that changed. Why should a search engine struggle to find this information when we can easily generate it? There's no need."/>
			<outline text="We've been waiting for an agreed-to format for this functionality. I think every webmaster will recognize the value of maintaining this information. We need agreement with the search engine companies. If you represent such a company, please send me email so you can be included in the discussion."/>
			<outline text="I think we need a practical example of real-world XML. "/>
			<outline text="This may be the first one?"/>
			<outline text="***Is XML just hype?"/>
			<outline text="No, it's not. Unlike some other industry initiatives, there are applications waiting for XML. I wouldn't be involved if that weren't true."/>
			<outline text="XML can go somewhere. First search engines, then caches running on your LAN, then sandboxes running on each machine. "/>

			<outline text="Oh man. As my body gets accustomed to the new more complicated vision interface it's making compromises. There are only so many positions that work in each situation. Maybe only one? Whatever. "/>
			<outline text="So my neck is doing work it never had to do before. To keep things in focus it has to hold my eyes in a constant position."/>
			<outline text="Maybe I should switch back to the old kind of glasses? I'm thinkin about it."/>
			<outline text="***Holiday nerding"/>
			<outline text="It's mid-way between the two big holidays. Christmas is over, I'm thankful for that, and we have New Year's to look forward to. "/>
			<outline text="In-between is a good time for reading and stretching and maybe learning about something new?"/>
			<outline text="***Scripting News"/>
			<outline text="My home page, http://www.scripting.com/ is like a bibliography for DaveNet. "/>
			<outline text="For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/12/xmasPiece.html&quot;&gt;on Christmas Eve&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about the Marx Brothers, and on Scripting News there's a link to a great biography site for four of the Marx Brothers."/>
			<outline text="DaveNet still reaches further than Scripting News, I think, but Scripting News has been growing steadily since its debut in April 1997."/>
			<outline text="***It's a content flow"/>
			<outline text="Scripting News is usually updated several times a day."/>
			<outline text="When I edit the page, it's an outline. I type in items, and render the page from the most recent seven outlines. The whole process is automatic, there's almost no hand-coding of HTML, and that's made it possible for me to create a new flow in a different format, XML."/>
			<outline text="One of the promises of XML is that it will make it possible to have different kinds of browsers, custom-built to present specialized content flows."/>
			<outline text="Scripting News is such a specialized flow, but one that's becoming more common. It's a news page, just like the home pages of all the big news websites."/>
			<outline text="So I decided to take the plunge, and take the chicken out of the chicken and egg problem. Or is it the egg? Who knows. But from now on, Scripting News, in addition to being a HTML web page, is also an XML application."/>
			<outline text="It's a nice way if you're nerdy to get a quick intro to what XML is about. And if you feel like really nerding out you could write a new kind of browser in Visual Basic or Java or Bongo or Filemaker or whatever. A great long weekend project. Let's have fun!"/>

			<outline text="And Bill Gates, one way or the other, will become the creative leader he must become, instead of the scrappy entrepreneur he used to be."/>
			<outline text="***What about Apple?"/>
			<outline text="At a party in San Francisco Saturday night I chatted with a woman who's still at Apple. She's a nice person. Under different circumstances I'm sure we'd be friends. "/>
			<outline text="I said I wished Apple the best. She smiles, and I get a raised eyebrow. Hmmm. I think I understand what this means. &quot;I was trying help Apple!&quot; I said in response, and I meant it. "/>
			<outline text="I was covering the Internet boom, I explained, as a writer and a software developer. In all the DaveNets I wrote, I was trying to show Apple how to navigate so the Mac could fully participate in the growth of the net. I was exclusively a Mac developer then, so my interest was clear. I wanted the Mac to do well, so I could do well."/>
			<outline text="I don't think any reasonable person, in hindsight, would disagree that Apple missed a big opportunity. Was I rubbing their nose in their blindness? Depends on how you look at it. They certainly didn't want to see opportunities. They must have wanted to see challenges because that's what they saw. "/>
			<outline text="It would have been easy to steer Apple to profitable growth in 1995 and 1996. It's not my fault they chose not to do it. I did the best I could."/>
			<outline text="***What about Microsoft?"/>
			<outline text="OK, so now I've navigated so that I'm no longer just a Mac developer. "/>
			<outline text="We have Windows users now. Even I am using Windows now."/>
			<outline text="So when am I going to try to help Microsoft in the same way I tried to help Apple?"/>
			<outline text="How about now?"/>
			<outline text="***It's different"/>
			<outline text="First, Microsoft and Apple are very different. Yes, there are good people at Apple, sometimes even great people, but the people who run the show, the execs, have always been disengaged from what's really happening at the company and especially outside the company. "/>
			<outline text="They didn't seem to work very hard, or be that creative, or whatever. The net-effect is that it's been over ten years since I had a conversation with an Apple exec where we see the world compatibly and can plot a win-win. There was always a disconnect, a lack of trust, an unwillingness to win."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is different. We're engaged in the same quest. We see things the same way. This XML stuff is making people incandescent, me too. I have something to contribute, and Microsoft doesn't respond with the jealousy that Apple did. "/>
			<outline text="I have excited and respectful conversations with Microsoft people every day. I don't withhold what I think. I use foul language (that's a good sign that I'm relaxed). The more I learn the more I see a hole that's filled by what we do that isn't filled by what they do."/>
			<outline text="I see Ed Iaccobucci building a huge and profitable company right in the middle of the Windows operating system! I see him doing deals with everyone but Microsoft. I don't see Microsoft crushing Citrix as Apple used to routinely crush developers who got too close to doing what they do."/>
			<outline text="Clearly, to win you have to not try to erase Microsoft. I totally understand. I'm the same way. When people try to erase me, my natural reaction is to stop them from doing it. I think all healthy human beings do that."/>
			<outline text="There seems to be a formula for co-existing with Microsoft where there was none for co-existing with Apple. But it requires depth and seductive abilities, courage, strength and resilience, and most of all, creativity. "/>
			<outline text="Novell and Borland fell to Microsoft. Intel, Cisco, IBM, Adobe and many others are thriving. If this were baseball or football we'd just say that Microsoft is a winner, we wouldn't worry about the losers. But this is business, not a sport, and we don't look at it the same way."/>
			<outline text="***How I view Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="Now I'm investing in Microsoft's platform. I'm steering users of my software to their operating system. I have to do it because it's right. The machines are fast and inexpensive and do a great job of running our software. The price-performance beats anything offered in the Macintosh world. If that changes I'll let you know."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has not threatened me as many people predict they will. Quite the opposite, Microsoft as a company, and the people at Microsoft have already helped my small company in very significant ways, and it looks like they're going to do more to help us."/>
			<outline text="To clear things up for people who see a contradiction, this is always what I asked Apple to do with us. To work for our success, so we could return the favor. I never wanted to be Apple, I am truly a software entrepreneur, not a large-company exec. I just wanted to be successful making software for the Mac. I think they completely missed my motive. I don't think Microsoft misses this."/>
			<outline text="I'm not a threat to Microsoft. That's essential for my success, and not my nature. I've been in the software business as long as Bill Gates has. If I wanted to replace him, it would have been a lot easier to do it in the late 70s, early 80s or even the early 90s. The Microsoft of the next millenium is uneraseable by anyone in the software industry. So don't try!"/>
			<outline text="***Sun's proposition"/>
			<outline text="Sun dreamed of a world without Microsoft. We took a look. But..."/>
			<outline text="Port all your code to Java, they said, if you want to be able to connect Frontier scripts to software that's written in Java. What a ridiculous proposition. "/>
			<outline text="Java isn't that important. There's PERL, Tcl, Rexx, JavaScript, VB Script and SQL, none of which require us to port our software to connect to their software. "/>
			<outline text="Java truly is a captive world unto itself. The only way to talk to it is to become part of it.  Yuck!"/>
			<outline text="***TCP and XML"/>
			<outline text="Instead we went with TCP, an open standard of the Internet. We'll talk to Java code thru TCP and use XML to send parameters and receive returned results. I'm sure someone on the Java side of the fence will wire up to this pair of protocols."/>
			<outline text="***Trust"/>
			<outline text="Developers have to be smart. We have to look at what's being offered and have the guts to say no. Success requires enormous creativity! There's no forgiveness in business. If you make a stupid decision, you always pay for it. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft could learn to trust this."/>
			<outline text="***Timing"/>
			<outline text="I think we're entering the Windows software world at exactly the right moment. "/>
			<outline text="Browsers are getting boring. The Java euphoria is almost over. Microsoft is struggling with the judicial system the same way they struggled with Sun over Java. "/>
			<outline text="Instead of struggling, I hope they take the high road and back off. In retrospect, I believe Microsoft could have given Sun the right to include unmodified Java Runtimes with Windows for five years for free, and it would have made Microsoft bigger and stronger if they had done it."/>
			<outline text="In the same way, I think they could back off in their battle with the government, and make their browser a downloadable item from their website, do it elegantly, include software in the OS that loads any browser you want. And back off and enjoy the huge growth such a framework would create."/>
			<outline text="Why? If they opened up a new channel for net access software, entrepreneurial companies like mine would rush to fill the void. We're ready to do it, our base software is ported. We could have fun here!"/>
			<outline text="***Something to think about"/>
			<outline text="Hey, HTML is not the last word in display formats. "/>
			<outline text="Let's invent some new ones. "/>
			<outline text="Does Microsoft have to do all the browsing software? No more than they have to do all the fonts. Think about it."/>
			<outline text="***Navigators"/>
			<outline text="It's time for Microsoft to navigate. I just had to do it. Everyone does it. Life forces change. "/>

			<outline text="***A story"/>
			<outline text="A couple of Saturdays ago I was filling up my truck at a local gas station. A parade of people holding candles, some dressed in costumes, is marching down the main street, singing Christmas songs. As they approach I can hear the words are different even though the melodies are familliar."/>
			<outline text="About thirty people stood in front of me while I filled the tank, singing to me and only me. A scene from a Dickens novel! I couldn't believe all this was just for me. I am touched, I'm laughing and smiling, taking it in."/>
			<outline text="A woman and a young child approach. The child hands me a red piece of paper with a candy cane attached. She smiles. I thank her."/>
			<outline text="The words really are different! The songs are about a man who runs a far-away hotel that they work in. They're very upset with him. They came to his hometown, my town, to let his neighbors know they don't like him. "/>
			<outline text="In the United States this is legal! You're allowed to visit your boss's hometown and march down main street in the hope of getting his attention."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft's struggle"/>
			<outline text="I've been talking with Microsoft people about this stuff for the last week or so. I see their side of the story and have encouraged them to tell it. "/>
			<outline text="But I also see the other side, and in fact, I am on the other side. I am looking for a change in Microsoft's relationship with the rest of the world. Why? Because the software world is too big to be dominated by one company. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft can influence the change, they can move proactively. Or they can wait and eventually the change will happen around them."/>
			<outline text="I won't join the camp that says Microsoft is evil, because I don't believe it. I believe they are struggling to understand, and that's good. I hope for an awakening, a new view, a new way forward for Microsoft that allows others to safely lead them. A view that says they don't do it all, a view that allows them to build on the work of others without swamping or crushing them or steering them into irrelevance."/>
			<outline text="They don't invent everything at Microsoft, and they don't understand everything. If more attention were focused on great things happening outside, it wouldn't appear as if everything were happening there, and the world could be happier without limiting Microsoft's power."/>
			<outline text="I think the message from the courts and the public support for it are much like the message from the people who visited my hometown to sing about their employer. I imagine the man as insulated and impenetrable. I imagine that he has a way of brushing aside their passion and self-love, explaining it as self-interested or inelegant in some way."/>
			<outline text="***The message"/>
			<outline text="No doubt the message from the courts is a clumsy one that's hard for Microsoft to hear. "/>
			<outline text="But it's unmistakable. Some people would like a kinder, more generous Microsoft; one that embraces the big picture without trying to own it, without trying to be it."/>
			<outline text="It's time for Microsoft to make a choice -- to lead, to become a great company; or continue to struggle and put off the growth."/>

			<outline text="I got new glasses today!"/>
			<outline text="I remember when I got my first pair of glasses at age eight or so."/>
			<outline text="I was happy to get them. I remember how sharp things looked. I could read street signs. Wow. It was a revelation."/>
			<outline text="Well, my eyes changed again."/>
			<outline text="I could read easily during the day, but at night, only if the type was big or the light was very bright."/>
			<outline text="My new glasses have a very advanced user interface. The top part is for distance viewing, the bottom for reading, the middle for intermediate distances. To the left and right are blurry areas, they say to train my eyes to stay in the middle."/>
			<outline text="My eyes have never had to work so hard just to see."/>
			<outline text="But everything is so sharp! I see my carpets need cleaning. I also see the sky is so blue! Much bluer than I remember."/>
			<outline text="My hearing feels sharper too."/>
			<outline text="I guess it's always a good day to get new glasses."/>
			<outline text="I'll let you know what I see!"/>

			<outline text="Good morning and welcome to the 1997 DaveNet Christmas special."/>
			<outline text="Here's my contribution to sanity or as The Marx Brothers used to say, my Sanity Clause. "/>
			<outline text="Ho ho ho!"/>
			<outline text="Or, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jurinet.com/BRhoades/JRhoades/humor/bart_moe.htm&quot;&gt;Bart Simpson&lt;/a&gt; says (approximately) &quot;This is the time of year when people of all faiths get together to worship Jesus.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The normal rules are tossed out this time of year. People are more cheerful? It's fun to watch. Oh honey, let's be cheerful today. &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://amaiman.dragonfire.net/wav.simpsons/32DOHS.WAV&quot;&gt;Doh&lt;/a&gt;! "/>
			<outline text="Let's practice good cheer 365 days a year. Hey that rhymes! "/>
			<outline text="One smile a day keeps the doctor away. More? OK!"/>
			<outline text="***The year in review"/>
			<outline text="So what happened this year? "/>
			<outline text="We cloned sheep and we drove around on Mars. This is cool stuff. "/>
			<outline text="Did the software or Internet industries produce any really exciting stuff? Uhhh!"/>
			<outline text="Oooops. "/>
			<outline text="I could have gone sailing in Greece and not really missed anything."/>
			<outline text="I could have made pottery!"/>
			<outline text="Or whatever."/>
			<outline text="Instead I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/12/newGlasses.html&quot;&gt;new glasses&lt;/a&gt;."/>
			<outline text="***My new glasses"/>
			<outline text="Only one person asked why they should be interested in my new glasses."/>
			<outline text="That's progress! "/>
			<outline text="***Sax and Violins"/>
			<outline text="Listening to music today, Sax and Violins, by the Talking Heads. "/>
			<outline text="What a beautiful song! As with most David Byrne lyrics, themes of outlawism and daddy trips and babies and little boys and girls. &quot;He looks so cute in his little red suit!&quot; OK, that's another song. But one lyric from Sax and Violins seems to be written for Bill Gates. &quot;We are criminals who never broke no laws!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Byrne imagines a post-industrial civilization, where the darkest and most basic of our rules thrive. It's a world where we work out our childhood frustrations without any inhibitions. No need to manipulate small symbols. Just take over a city and destroy it! You can do that in music, and Byrne does it really well."/>
			<outline text="My new glasses are real. They break up a lot of the trances. All of a sudden I'm aware of all my senses. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail971223.html&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; on the new glasses. One writer predicts more vivid dreams, and last night the dreams *were* sharper, the dialog more memorable, the personalities more clearly individuals instead of amalgams of lots of different people."/>
			<outline text="Do new glasses make you smarter?"/>
			<outline text="***A more serious question"/>
			<outline text="There were the sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties."/>
			<outline text="What will we call the decade between 2000 and 2009?"/>
			<outline text="***Smells and sleep"/>
			<outline text="A fire in the fireplace, a turkey in the oven. Smells of the holiday. "/>
			<outline text="Crisp winter weather. Freezing temperatures. My garden goes to sleep in whole new ways. "/>
			<outline text="***Hopes and deer"/>
			<outline text="One year ends, another begins."/>
			<outline text="What do I hope for in 1998?"/>
			<outline text="Friendship, empowerment, self-acceptance and self-love. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of new adventures, new growth, and no fear."/>
			<outline text="A happy garden with lots of beautiful roses and no friggin deer!"/>
			<outline text="Most important of all -- happy friendships grounded in reality. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of talking and listening and sharing. "/>
			<outline text="Especially between software products from different companies. {qbullet.imageref (&quot;sidesmiley&quot;)}"/>
			<outline text="***Time is on our side"/>
			<outline text="To everyone, especially old friends, there's still a bunch more time. Let's have fun!"/>
