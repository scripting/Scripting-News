			<outline text="Happy new year!"/>
			<outline text="Go get a cup of coffee before you read this one."/>
			<outline text="It's gonna be a strrrrretch!"/>
			<outline text="I've wanted to write this piece for several years, but didn't know how. The new year provides a transition point. Some truth comes out?"/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***A little boy's tears"/>
			<outline text="A few years ago, a pool party at my house, a bunch of adults and kids. "/>
			<outline text="A six year old boy runs to his father, wraps himself around his dad and starts crying. Tears rush down his face. "/>
			<outline text="I connect with myself as a boy. When I missed a catch playing baseball, or got a bad grade at school, I would start crying and it embarassed me."/>
			<outline text="Many years later, I look at my friend's son and feel pity for him for having such poor control of his feelings."/>
			<outline text="***A young woman's tears"/>
			<outline text="In the last weeks of a long relationship, lying in bed with my lover, listening to her tell a story of a friend whose young husband had died suddenly."/>
			<outline text="Sitting in the front seat of a car, it's dark, four people, all women, two in front, two in back. In the back seat her friend starts weeping loudly and uncontrollably."/>
			<outline text="How horrible to feel so deeply that you lose control, I said to myself at the time, listening to the story. I couldn't imagine how I could deal with pain so deep that it forces you to show weakness."/>
			<outline text="***Dave's tears"/>
			<outline text="A few months later, after a breakup that would be unbelievable if you saw it on a soap opera, I was in a gym exercising with my brother. After the workout, lots of heavy breathing and lifting, we went to the sauna."/>
			<outline text="It happened to me! I started weeping uncontrollably. All mixtures of feelings came pouring out. The crying was the visible sign of something much larger that was erupting. "/>
			<outline text="My brother got upset, as I had a few months earlier. &quot;You shouldn't do that here!&quot; he said. My weeping turned into laughter. I wanted him to know that it felt great! Much better than what it replaced, the act of not weeping. It takes so much energy to keep it bottled up. What a relief to let it go."/>
			<outline text="***Men must be silent"/>
			<outline text="In this age, as in previous ones, we define manhood as the ability to control one's emotions. This has gotten us in trouble, and we know it."/>
			<outline text="There are two sides to the problem. Can men express themselves and will women and other men let them?"/>
			<outline text="I have trouble listening to men. There's something weird about a man telling you how he feels, what he sees. I've learned to get over this strangeness. I listen to men as I listen to women, when they're willing to talk. "/>
			<outline text="Women speak of themselves so freely. They organize, they teach and train, they even teach boys how to be men. "/>
			<outline text="Men have lousy PR. As individuals we can shine, but we don't do anything to improve the reputation of our gender."/>
			<outline text="***Two sides, one coin"/>
			<outline text="I hear complaints from women who want men to be more expressive. I have something to say to them. "/>
			<outline text="When you're ready to hear what men have to say, men will say more. "/>
			<outline text="There's two sides to every coin. A lot of men, including me, don't feel as if we have permission to speak our truth, to say what we see. The barriers seem to be everywhere."/>
			<outline text="***Something to think about"/>
			<outline text="How do you feel about this piece?"/>
			<outline text="Does it make you scared?"/>
			<outline text="Do you wonder what's coming next?"/>
			<outline text="Do you want to unsubscribe?"/>
			<outline text="Think about it. "/>
			<outline text="I don't want to say these things. That's why I'm saying them. "/>
			<outline text="You may not want to hear them. That's why you should hear them."/>
			<outline text="***Men stay silent"/>
			<outline text="Men stay silent. We manipulate symbols to express ourselves. We bottle up who we are. We try to achieve the vision the world has for us, whether it's true or not."/>
			<outline text="Basically, we lock up lies in our bodies. People don't listen when we have something to say. So we stay quiet. Some of us explode in anger. Either way, we end up disappearing. "/>
			<outline text="Dead eyes. Lifeless lives. "/>
			<outline text="***Myths"/>
			<outline text="Men are strong."/>
			<outline text="Men have no fear."/>
			<outline text="It's a man's world!"/>
			<outline text="***Let's get real"/>
			<outline text="Every man had a mother."/>
			<outline text="We create each other and together we create the world we live in."/>
			<outline text="No one must be silent."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Male Anger&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/2/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday, a view of male emotion in &quot;Men Stay Silent&quot;."/>
			<outline text="Today a specific look at one emotion, anger, evidence of its existence, justification for it, and safe ways to release it."/>
			<outline text="***Texas to execute a woman"/>
			<outline text="On the front page of yesterday's New York Times, a story of a woman, Karla Faye Tucker. She's on death row in Texas, scheduled to be executed on February 3."/>
			<outline text="Before discussing the specifics of the case, how do you feel about this?"/>
			<outline text="In Texas they're having quite a problem. Killing a woman? Wow. In the name of justice! It doesn't fit the Texas lifestyle."/>
			<outline text="Television evangelists, her prosecuting attorney, the family of a victim all agree. It's a mistake to kill this person."/>
			<outline text="Everyone says over and over that it doesn't matter that she's a woman, but we know it totally matters. Why is it more of a tragedy for the government to kill a human being just because the person is female? "/>
			<outline text="What does this say about our attitude, in general, about each of the genders?"/>
			<outline text="One deserves forgiveness, and the other deserves vengeance?"/>
			<outline text="Here's another experiment. What is your visual image of Ms. Tucker? Is she tall or short? Ugly or beautiful? Young or old? Black or white? Does any of this make a difference? Really go in there, try the experiment."/>
			<outline text="If you can find her picture on the net you might be shocked. "/>
			<outline text="***Bobbit"/>
			<outline text="A social setting in Marin County, California. Several adults, equal numbers of men and women. A woman uses the word &quot;Bobbit&quot;, in a (mock?) threatening tone, to a man, and then laughs. Everyone, men included, except me, laughs. I turn my head so they can't see the look on my face. I am outraged."/>
			<outline text="I believe it would do no good to stop the conversation and say &quot;I find that very offensive. I thought you were a friend. How can you make fun of sexual mutilation?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="That's the calm version, after several months of reflection and processing. The words that would express what I was really feeling would have been much stronger. The anger would have been clearer, not judged, not transformed into silent frustration."/>
			<outline text="I don't want anyone to get hurt, and that includes other men. I identify with the man in the Bobbit situation. It's impossible for me to have a balanced opinion about this. It's a horrible idea. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what I want to say to men about this. Stop laughing at things that aren't funny. And the same message, with something extra for women."/>
			<outline text="First, remember the golden rule. Imagine part of you being severed from your body. Double the value of that because of differences between men and women. "/>
			<outline text="The second thing that's wrong is that you probably aren't ready to hear from men about this. This is one of those barriers I talked about yesterday. I've tried. The response is &quot;lighten up&quot; or &quot;get over it&quot;. Uh huh. Learn to listen."/>
			<outline text="A joke! If a man said something in a forest and no woman heard him, would he still be wrong?"/>
			<outline text="It's so true!"/>
			<outline text="***Women creating men"/>
			<outline text="I heard a report on National Public Radio a few weeks back, talking about an educational program in an inner city to teach boys not to abuse women when they grow up. "/>
			<outline text="It was a long report, with interviews and tapes of the classroom sessions. The teachers don't pull any punches, they explain what abuse looks like, in detail, say why it's wrong, and explain what the penalties are for doing it."/>
			<outline text="The premise of the program is that the boys don't have healthy role models. Their fathers, uncles and brothers all abuse women, so they will become abusive when they have wives, girlfriends and children. The cycle continues."/>
			<outline text="OK, it seems reasonable at first, they're trying to stop the cycle, but I don't think it can work because the teachers are women. I know how this feels, the strongest personalities when I was growing up were women. They taught me what it means to be a man, from their perspective. Yeah, but they didn't have a very positive view of men! Oh boy. That left me with lots of old tricks to unlearn as an adult."/>
			<outline text="Boys are boys, but they have a sense of justice, I did when I was a child. The basic premise of childhood is innocence. Start with a clean slate. These boys are hearing that they're bad before they even get a chance to be good."/>
			<outline text="Instead, let's show them, by example, how to have fun and retain their masculinity. Giving them fear about themselves isn't going to get you what you want, nor is it fair. "/>
			<outline text="I strongly believe that only a man can teach a boy what manhood really means. Women taking control is one of the things that is wrong with the world."/>
			<outline text="***It's my anger"/>
			<outline text="Hopefully by now you've given me the right to have my anger."/>
			<outline text="Let me tell you about it. I get deeply angry when a government kills people in the name of justice. I think the Karla Faye Tucker case and the contradictions it reveals are the best evidence that if we look into our hearts, we're all against capital punishment. "/>
			<outline text="Yes, I am even more against killing a woman. I don't like what this says about me. I think the poor little boy inside every convicted killer deserves forgiveness. I don't think we can erase the wound, or serve justice, by killing any person, male or female. I don't think little girls are any more innocent than little boys."/>
			<outline text="It also makes me angry when anyone makes fun of violence done to another person's body. "/>
			<outline text="And it makes me angry, in a more confused way, when people insert themselves in the middle of situations that don't directly involve them."/>
			<outline text="This is me, what I believe, in some sense, who I am. The anger comes up. Emphatically, it is not a sign of weakness. I want my friends to know me, so I want to share what I see with them, but I don't want to direct the release of the anger at them. "/>
			<outline text="***What to do?"/>
			<outline text="Here are some tips."/>
			<outline text="Find a pillow and a tennis racket. Close the door. Smack the pillow as hard as you can with the racket. Scream as loudly as you can without hurting yourself or alarming others. Do it repeatedly."/>
			<outline text="Get a punching bag! "/>
			<outline text="Another one. If you have a pool or a hot tub nearby, you may not know this, but you can scream under water and no one can hear you. You can say anything you want. You can curse out anyone. Mom, Dad, anyone. "/>
			<outline text="For extra credit, after releasing your anger into the pillow or punching bag or water, get a hand mirror, look yourself in the eye, and explain how you feel, to the person in the mirror. Has the anger gone? What replaced it? Describe how your body feels. "/>
			<outline text="***Releasing anger"/>
			<outline text="Anger has to come out of your body."/>
			<outline text="It's not hard to find safe ways to let it out without hurting other people."/>
			<outline text="And if a friend is having an anger release, clean or not, don't judge it. Watch if they're willing to let you. But don't try to talk them out of it. Just listen."/>
			<outline text="As my mentor Yogi Berra said, you can observe a lot just by watching. It's so true."/>
			<outline text="Have a grrrreat day!"/>

			<outline text="Open your eyes!"/>
			<outline text="I hope I've done some of that in the last couple of pieces."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail980101.html "/>
			<outline text="And thank you for opening my eyes!"/>
			<outline text="***Happy New Year!"/>
			<outline text="Tomorrow most of us go back to work. Me too. I'm going to write some software. Some new stuff to try out with XML and remote procedure calling. It's 1998. That's what's going on. Looking forward to geeking out for a bit."/>
			<outline text="Have we reached closure on gender issues? No. But hopefully we've learned something."/>
			<outline text="***Lines and rules"/>
			<outline text="I recognize that there's a line between us that separates us into two genders. It's like a lot of other lines that separate people: skin color, height, employment status, sexual preference, marital status, financial wealth, education, religion, age, ancestry, the kind of computer you use; whether you work for government or a private company; have kids or don't have kids; were first born, or an only child, or the youngest of six; whether you're a child or an adult. "/>
			<outline text="I'm a Taurus and a type 8. What's *your* sign?"/>
			<outline text="You get the idea. The list of lines goes on and on. And the lines are real. We may wish they didn't exist, but they do. We do not have a choice. We are not empowered to erase the lines."/>
			<outline text="The lines are coool. They create friction, desire, heat, art, lust, passion! It's good stuff as long as people are fair and responsible and play by rules. "/>
			<outline text="When people accuse others of breaking the rules, especially across the lines, it gets so confusing! That's why the death penalty is such a difficult thing to parse. Make the punishment fit the crime? That says a lot about who we are."/>
			<outline text="The more empowering the rules, I think, the more responsibly people act without rules, the more joy there is in life."/>
			<outline text="***Thank you"/>
			<outline text="The first few days of 1998 have been an incredible growth period for me, and I hope for you too."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun this year!"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;MacWEEK and Frontier&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/5/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="On the opening day of MacWorld Expo in San Francisco, I'd like to make a small Mac-related announcement, certainly nothing of the magnitude that Apple will announce later today, but in our world, it's an important development."/>
			<outline text="MacWEEK, a unit of Ziff-Davis Publishing, has adopted Frontier as its content management platform for its www.macweek.com website."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/thea/MacWeek.html "/>
			<outline text="***There are so many lessons here! "/>
			<outline text="First, as we went forward, we stayed customer-driven. Since many of our users are Mac people, it made sense to continue to move the Mac version forward as we moved the Windows product forward. "/>
			<outline text="Second, as a derivative of the above, even though our team is mostly using Windows NT machines to develop, we can move sites like www.macweek.com forward because of the unique cross-platform power that comes from working in a database and scripting environment that's truly cross-platform. When we add a feature to our environment it immediately runs on both Mac and Windows. This is a powerful place to be, giving our community real leverage."/>
			<outline text="And the third lesson is that history is not predictable. Last year many people thought Apple was headed for oblivion. Now the market is restarted. A big publishing company, Ziff-Davis, is making an investment in Mac publishing technology. And it's a good investment, because, as I've been saying for so many years, there are lots of important publishing-oriented things you can do on Macs that you can't do anywhere else."/>
			<outline text="***Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="Finally, thanks to MacWEEK for trusting us with its web presence. This is an important milestone. We look forward to working with them for many years to come."/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon!"/>
			<outline text="We're moving again in a technical direction."/>
			<outline text="Coming next is XML-based remote procedure calling over TCP."/>
			<outline text="If that sounds like alphabet soup to you, wait for the next piece or the one after that."/>
			<outline text="No anger here, or tears, male or otherwise -- no other emotion other than excitement."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***Bang that Script!"/>
			<outline text="You can help by checking out this web page:"/>
			<outline text="http://206.204.24.10:81/dw.letsHaveFun.fcgi "/>
			<outline text="Every time you access that URL you will be helping to burn in new software that responds to requests over the Internet. So bang that CGI. Do it with style! Make a personal statement. Enjoy the experience."/>
			<outline text="There's nothing new and revolutionary here, until I remember that, for Windows web developers, there *is* something new happening here. We've had this stuff working on the Mac for a couple of years. But with all due respect to people who develop on Windows, you haven't got it yet. Coming soooon!"/>
			<outline text="So I hope you visit that page, and help us by reloading a few times, and read the story. I think you'll find it interesting."/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: What's the new thing? A web server with an integrated object database, HTML rendering engine, outliner, development tools, workflow, verb set, multi-threaded runtime. Put together, this is called a Content Management System. Yeah yeah, it's a new thing. Java can't do it. Perl can't either. We been diggin!"/>

		<outline text="Affirmative Action" created="1/8/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="affirmativeAction" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/8/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I was flamed yesterday, one more time, from what remains of the Mac zealots. When will they get the clue that I was never part of their cause? I don't want it. I don't think it's much of a cause. I think there are bigger more interesting causes to be part of. "/>
			<outline text="There are lessons to learn from the platform wars. Some philosophies are uncovered. This is interesting. The message from the zealots seems to echo Apple's slogan, with an addendum. Think different! they say. As long as you think as we do. Oooops. "/>
			<outline text="I have a better slogan. Think for yourself! That's meant in the positive and in the negative. In the positive, thinking for yourself says you may come to different conclusions than I do. In the negative, it means stop telling me how to think. "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, yesterday's cause for flames was a link I placed on the Scripting News home page to the CNBC &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/modules/vod/980106jobs.asp?pipe=56&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Steve Jobs on Tuesday. Jobs walked off the set, saying that the reporter, Bruce Francis, had broken an agreement not to ask questions on a certain topic. The reporter says there was no such deal. I believe him. I know that a good reporter doesn't make deals. To have the job that he has, he has to subscribe to a general journalist ethic that says no deals."/>
			<outline text="But even if Francis broke a deal, it was not astute of Jobs to walk away. My inner-journalist feels pain at the accusation. Because it's on the web, totally public, everyone can feel the chill. Imagine how he deals with employees? With developers? Stockholders? Board members? Potential CEOs? Oh man. A cold wind! It doesn't feel good."/>
			<outline text="***A Be Fund?"/>
			<outline text="I've been getting more mail lately from enthusiasts who want a Be version of our software."/>
			<outline text="I've said it before, I'll say it again, I want to see the Be OS gain traction, become a popular operating system, with lots of developers and users. The more operating systems there are, the more features we'll get in other operating systems. There's a bunch of value in starting over. And people who know good technology rave about the Be OS. "/>
			<outline text="But every operating system is a collection of leaps of faith adding up to critical mass. The Be system isn't there yet. The pump needs more priming. We can help by moving our source code to their APIs. We'd like to do that, but there's no investment capital available to fund this development. I can't move dollars from my savings account into programmer's pockets to make this happen. If I can't raise money to make the software, we can't make the software."/>
			<outline text="I've tried to explain this to my friend Jean-Louis Gassee, the president of Be, but he doesn't seem to hear me. Maybe he wants a Be Fund to exist and the VCs and investment bankers have said no? I don't know. He hasn't said."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I thought I'd raise the issue publicly. There's no shortage of talented programmers who want to make software for this OS. The VCs have so much money they can't figure out what to do with it. Maybe it's time for them make a leap of faith and do something strategic. Sooner or later the opportunities will run out; planting a few seeds now in a friendly OS could make a big difference. Think of it as a savings account for a rainy day. All that's needed is money for developers and the Be thing takes off."/>
			<outline text="***Java's lifecycle"/>
			<outline text="If you read one piece on Java this month, please read this landmark &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketingcomputers.com/january/bean.asp &quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; in Marketing Computers magazine. There are so many great soundbites. The author, Claire Tristram, totally gets it. She's been listening to developers. The promise of Java, once so bright, is not so bright now. Sun is playing a stock market game. Their developer story is full of lies and unanswered questions. "/>
			<outline text="Then check &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/review/java.html &quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out. Mirror images. I'm a developer writing about the press, Ms. Tristam is a member of the press writing about developers. Same story! Cooool."/>
			<outline text="***Remember Karla Faye"/>
			<outline text="The email exchanges resulting from the first two pieces this year, &quot;Men Stay Silent&quot; and &quot;Male Anger&quot;, provided me with more opportunities to grow than some entire years in my life! I made a decision to discuss gender issues publicly and let the chips fall where they may. These were heavily and carefully edited pieces. It took me a whole lifetime of struggling with the opposite sex to get thru it and give myself permission to say what I had to say."/>
			<outline text="There was some luck involved. I didn't know about the Karla Faye Tucker case until after the first piece was out. It was a perfect vehicle for illustrating the differences in how we view each of our genders. Here's a case where a woman committed a horrible crime, and the knee-jerk response is forgiveness, kindness, understanding, clemency. But these are things we all deserve, especially men who have never killed or physically hurt anyone."/>
			<outline text="To people in the press, the Karla Faye Tucker case deserves exposure. We may be able to save her life. And this may be the best chance we have to expose the contradictions of capital punishment. A lot of healing is possible here. If we let her die without a discussion we will have taken a major step backwards. "/>
			<outline text="February 3, her execution date, is pretty close."/>
			<outline text="***Brotherhood and friendship"/>
			<outline text="When I was a boy most of my friends were boys. It was so easy to be friends back then, there was so little in the way. Now it's more complicated, but I found out that it doesn't need to be. "/>
			<outline text="The response from men to the two pieces was overwhelming. The boys are mature now, but there's still a brotherhood. I found out that there are lots of men who want to be friends. This is a new idea, to me at least."/>
			<outline text="Some people questioned the relevance of this stuff to my usual topic, life in the software industry. But it's very relevant. With few exceptions, the companies are run by men. So despite what some people think, writing about men is exactly on-topic for the software industry. Like it or not, for better or worse, male issues are the issues of the software business."/>
			<outline text="That's the big picture. Here's the big answer. Let's empower each other to do the best we can. We can be who we are and be part of a team that accomplishes a lot. Why not? If there are people who don't want to play, that'll be their loss. We'll win! Eventually they'll want to play too. I'm sure of it."/>
			<outline text="***Affirmative action"/>
			<outline text="Now that I've spoken my male issues, amazingly I find it easier to listen to the woman's point of view!"/>
			<outline text="I've heard a bunch of stories about male limits imposed on females. "/>
			<outline text="About men who physically abuse women."/>
			<outline text="About little girls who are taught to be worthless by adult men."/>
			<outline text="About adult women who can't unlearn their worthlessness."/>
			<outline text="I admire women for reaching out to me, a man, given all the terrible things that men have given them. Imagine how much courage it takes to wonder, looking at a man's smile, if he's going to love you... or kill you? That's something men will never understand about women. Their courage. The way they are tested. It's unlike anything we have to deal with."/>
			<outline text="It takes huge courage to be a woman in a world with so many men, but so many women still believe in our goodness. There's the power in our species! We are drawn together even though there are so many reasons to be apart."/>
			<outline text="A long time ago, on MTV, I saw a profound little soundbite aimed at heartbroken people who have been wounded in love. The message went like this. "/>
			<outline text="You may not think, right now, that you'll try again (take a breath) but you will."/>
			<outline text="I think that's the lesson of the human race. Renewal. Belief. "/>
			<outline text="Trying again and again and again."/>

A polite but firm &quot;let's move on&quot; is totally OK. It would have been a stronger statement. It would have given me more confidence in him and in the future direction of Apple."/>

			<outline text="Hey it's the machine that Steve Jobs owns. Did the users take it back? No, far from it. Many months after Steve's triumphal return to Apple, followed shortly by the cancellation of the clones, I look back to the Mac community and see a black hole."/>
			<outline text="Sure, Steve gets that Microsoft, Netscape, Macromedia and Oracle (huh?) are big Mac developers. But what about Quark and Adobe? What about BBEdit and WebSTAR and Eudora and Cyberstudio and Netobjects Fusion? What about all the companies developing beautiful Mac-only software that no one has heard of? Is Apple doing anything to make them more visible?"/>
			<outline text="Is there any point trying to roll new software out thru the Mac platform?"/>
			<outline text="My belief: not unless you've kissed Steve's ring."/>
			<outline text="***I don't kiss rings"/>
			<outline text="I'm my own man. With a popular website and thousands of users, I'm dressed for success. I hope!"/>
			<outline text="Hey I actually *like* the stuff. That, and a brain, and some experience running a company are all that's required, in my humble opinion."/>
			<outline text="Yes, I want to make a lot of money from my software, but I want to do it the old fashioned way, thru a business that's engaged to marry its customers. Based on listening and responding and a product whose feature set matches the aspirations of the people who use it."/>
			<outline text="The old Silicon Valley story says you hire a suit to do your IPO roadshow, delegating the product and focusing on selling stock. That's what I don't buy. According to the San Jose Mercury-News, Netscape's CEO, Jim Barksdale, the oft-cited example for winning on Wall Street, doesn't use email. He is the CEO of a company that proposes to revolutionize the way businesses communicate. This is just plain wrong. Same old loop, a corner cut, a brief spark, a light that goes on, then off. We lose when we let Wall Street form the strategies for our technology companies."/>
			<outline text="Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/04/HailMary.html&quot;&gt;writing about Java&lt;/a&gt;, I asked &quot;When will Silicon Valley get the message that great software is created by people not companies? When will the financiers of Silicon Valley set up corporate systems that serve the products, instead of vice versa? And when will creative engineers stop selling their babies to the miserable petty agendas of small thinking corporate credit-takers?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I want to zig where everyone else zags. I want to build a smart organization, grounded in product. I think that's the way to do a solid cashout for my shareholders, not one that disappoints. It may take longer, but I believe what The Supremes used to sing, you can't hurry love. You can't cut corners, you pay for your sins, the customer is always right. There are so many slogans, so much wisdom."/>
			<outline text="I'm going to take my own advice and hold out for the smart deal. I will not become stupid just to get rich. Life is too short."/>
			<outline text="***Traveling to Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="I've been traveling to Microsoft since 1981. On my first trip they had just raised their first round of venture capital from Technology Venture Investors. The IBM PC would come out later that year. They were primarily a languages company. They were not public. I was coming from a larger company, the company that made Visicalc, one of the first companies to tube because they had a CEO who didn't use the products."/>
			<outline text="Over the years I've done one deal with Microsoft, but I've tried many times. That was before DaveNet. I used to be an Apple II developer, then a PC developer. I've written about Microsoft here, many times, but for most of the life of DaveNet I was a Mac-only developer. That changed in November 1997 when I became a Windows user. Now my company produces software for both platforms, but my job on my six-person team is to understand how our stuff fits into the culture of Windows software."/>
			<outline text="I've gone from being a Windows newbie to being an intermediate Windows user. I could now give advice to newbies, especially ones who want to continue to use their Macs. And I can do some things that no other Windows user can, because  my content management software was ported before I converted."/>
			<outline text="***My new mission"/>
			<outline text="My mission is simple, to integrate our functionality with Windows, to move that platform forward as powerfully as I can, in the same way I moved the Mac platform forward in the late 80s and early-mid 90s."/>
			<outline text="I want to see NT become everything Unix is and much more. I've chosen sides. My bet, made in mid-1996, was that Microsoft is more motivated to win than Sun is. That bet is just now coming to fruition. Like I said, you can't hurry love! So..."/>
			<outline text="With all possible humility, I know I can help Microsoft win."/>
			<outline text="Now I write from a different perspective. I've had to unlearn some old tricks -- like assuming our software was running on a platform that people didn't think would survive. I keep having to remind myself of this. Now I can suggest a Windows NT solution running our software, and know that I will not have to deal with people's paranoia about Apple's survivability."/>
			<outline text="Losing the loser attitude has been a major task for me."/>
			<outline text="Over and over I say to myself, it's over, it's over."/>
			<outline text="The nightmare is over."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="Welcome to my new nightmare!"/>
			<outline text="To people who say I have the blinders on, that I'm naive, that Microsoft will only rip off my ideas and leave me bankrupt, let me prove to you that I know better than that."/>
			<outline text="In 1981, 1985, 1986 and 1991 I tried to win with Microsoft. Only one time did it actually happen, did we get a check from Microsoft for all the effort. And each time our meetings yielded a competitive development effort inside Microsoft. It doesn't take much in the way of brains to extrapolate that in 1998 they will try to usurp our ideas once again."/>
			<outline text="In 1991, we saw them doing it, and we decided to go home. We both lost, I think, because their internal scripting, outlining and database people did not end up duplicating our effort. They did it the hard way, and came up empty. If we had fought them on it, they would have gotten it right."/>
			<outline text="I was disgusted with their self-centered we-can-do-it-all attitude. To Mike Maples, Jeff Raikes and Pete Higgins, I hope you learned something -- I did. Big company software often misses the mark. If you want to hit a bulls-eye, go with the people who live in the market. You need me to show you how my market works. And if I can't win, I pick up my chips and leave and don't look back."/>
			<outline text="But, to the skeptics, I'm not going to dwell on it. I can try again. I can move on. I recognize that the situation is different now. Do I have enough ingredients to make a win-win? Maybe. Is there a way to win? Only if I can influence Microsoft to not interfere."/>
			<outline text="Apple taught me that the platform vendor has to agree not to get in the way in order for a new market to develop on their platform. I may not like it, I may want to be fully independent of the platform vendor, but that isn't how the world works."/>
			<outline text="A seduction is needed. You have to be able to trade a little fear against optimism. I have to have a respectful fear of what the platform vendor can do to me, my product and my user base. And as arrogant as it may seem, I have to be able to evoke their fear too. Big companies only respond to threats. They hear their competitors much better than their friends. Hey they don't really have friends! Name me one company that's being honest when they say Apple is their friend? Repeat the same exercise for Microsoft. That's not how we do it in this business. (It's a shame, by the way.)"/>
			<outline text="The stronger and more valuable my user base is -- assuming they can hear them at the platform vendor (a challenge, because they create so much noise inside the companies) -- the more I can successfully chart a course around a powerful and influential platform vendor."/>
			<outline text="That's why it's taken Apple and Novell so long to succumb to the power of Microsoft, even though their technology has been matched or exceeded by Microsoft. The users built systems around Novell and Apple networks. It takes a lot to make these people move."/>
			<outline text="I have to do the same thing. Entice Windows users to build systems out of my software. Trust us to be strong and to be able to express our strength, so that if Microsoft attacks they can look at us and still see success."/>
			<outline text="***Where the attack will come from"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has Front Page. They could add an object database, a macro language, templates, link management, an object oriented hierarchy for web content, outliner and debugging tools, a multi-threaded server runtime, workflow framework and connections to other apps; and do the same on the Mac, and then we'd have a formidable competitor."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has Windows NT, which is also a web server. They could add all these high-level features to the server, moving it from merely being a file server to being a content management system that could run newsrooms like the one at News.com, or InfoWorld, or PC WEEK, PC World, etc."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft could deliver nirvana. When? If they really focus, and get some great experienced developers working in our area, it could happen in three to five years. And do I really believe they could deliver something as beautiful and simple as Frontier? It'll never happen. They're too wed to their own internal logic to be able to craft something as gorgeously integrated. It just won't happen. After all these years, I think I know that."/>
			<outline text="But they don't seem to know that. That's where my fear comes from. But our software is strong and complete. That's where my courage comes from. I hope Microsoft will take the high road, and help us develop the market without pushing us towards irrelevance. To invest in links from their server to our content system, to connect their editing and client tools to our software, to appreciate our software for the advantage it gives them over Unix and the Mac, instead of holding back Windows users while they get their software ready."/>
			<outline text="***My dream"/>
			<outline text="My dream is that a hundred people inside Microsoft start using our software and learn alongside us how to connect it up to the things Microsoft is already doing. That's how I want it to happen. The lightbulbs could go off on both sides of the fence, not just on ours."/>
			<outline text="***Palm Springs next week"/>
			<outline text="Next week at the Microsoft Tech-Ed conference in Palm Springs, I will introduce Frontier 5.0."/>
			<outline text="They've been very kind to us, we have an hour and a half to tell our story. They're carrying our message on their website. We wrote the story, not them. They've made lots of offers to continue to carry our message after the rollout. Thank you Microsoft!"/>
			<outline text="Why did I choose a Microsoft venue to roll my product out? It's simple -- I want a chance to demo my software to a hundred geekish Microsoft people at a single time. And I want to give them a chance to see how a hundred independent web developers respond to what we've developed. If all goes well, after that event we'll have a good idea how we should move forward in the coming months and years."/>
			<outline text="If it doesn't go well, we'll know that we should look elsewhere to build our new base of users."/>
			<outline text="For me, a lot will be at stake there!"/>
			<outline text="Oh well, we keep diggin, I just want to make a beautiful garden. "/>

		<outline text="Netscape to Release Source" created="1/22/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="netscapeToReleaseSource" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Netscape to Release Source&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/22/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Netscape did something remarkable today."/>
			<outline text="In all my years in the software business, never has a single move by a single vendor done more to upset my assumptions about how things would move forward."/>
			<outline text="I didn't think it could happen, but we've actually been thinking about this possibility for about a week. First, a popular developer site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/slashdot.cgi?mode=article&amp;artnum=425&quot;&gt;slashdot.org&lt;/a&gt;, called for Netscape to release the source code for Navigator. Then I was cc'd on an email from Tim Lundeen, tlundeen@lundeen.com, to Marc Andreessen, marca@netscape.com, suggesting that Netscape release the source code for Navigator. To me it was amazing when Andreessen replied saying that they were considering the idea."/>
			<outline text="Then this morning, along with news that Microsoft and the Department of Justice had settled the bundling issue, comes an announcement from Netscape that they will release the source code for Navigator with the 5.0 release, expected later this year."/>
			<outline text="I have a lot of comments and ideas and questions stemming from this announcement. I'm sure there will be more to say as the idea sinks in, but here's what's on the top of my mind right now."/>
			<outline text="The first thing I wonder is should I will do development in the new system? I had pretty much given up on getting features I want in web browser software. So much so, that I was looking to the next generation of content, XML, to provide the opportunity to play with smart sandboxes with scripted firewalls and stronger connections to content management software, all of which would require new features in the browser. "/>
			<outline text="There are also tags that would open up new power, things that would be easy to implement, but that we haven't been able to convince either Netscape or Microsoft to implement. In the new scheme, we won't need their permission. We can start a new browser using their source code, try the ideas out and then lobby them to include it in their next distribution. If they say no, and the ideas are compelling enough, we can release the software on our own."/>
			<outline text="It also may mean a lot for the education of engineers. Think of it as an investment in the next generation of software developers. I learned a lot in the 70s reading the source code of the Unix OS. I'm sure programmers still do that. Adding a complex multi-threaded graphic program like Navigator to the mix will be very interesting from this standpoint!"/>
			<outline text="Will Microsoft match Netscape and release the source code for Explorer? What a trip that would be! "/>
			<outline text="Will venture capitalists invest in teams of browser developers? That would be interesting. And surprising! It could happen."/>
			<outline text="Will Sun follow suit and drop the source for Java?"/>
			<outline text="Could we move beyond the page metaphor? Could entire new structures be built on HTML-based content? How about implementing Microsoft's version of Dynamic HTML in Netscape's browser? With the source code available this wouldn't have to wait for Netscape to do it."/>
			<outline text="Further, this is a case of a company not buckling under the threat of Microsoft's competition. Unlike Novell and Apple who failed to zig to Microsoft's zag, Netscape is doing something different. Bravo! I've said it before, Netscape had options, they didn't have to drive into the Microsoft brick wall at full speed. This new twist shows that if you think creatively, you can find other options. I never would have been so bold as to ask them to release their source code. Now that they've done it, I'm very thankful. It's a high road move. Good deal."/>
			<outline text="It's also good for the Internet. It's a vote of faith in capaphony and the creativity of the random programmer &quot;out there&quot;. It totally levels the playing field, gives everyone a chance at breaking out of the browser wars. "/>
			<outline text="On the whole a nice way to shake the earth."/>
			<outline text="Thanks Netscape!"/>
			<outline text="***Mail"/>
			<outline text="There's already a lot of mail on this."/>

			<outline text="***Addicted to Noise?"/>
			<outline text="I've become addicted to the Senate impeachment trial, the way many people became fascinated with the OJ Simpson trial. I lament the day it ends. I find it frustrating and enticing at the same time. It's frustrating when they miss a key point, and enticing because every once in a while they show me a new way of looking at things that I had never considered."/>
			<outline text="I know that most of my fellow Americans aren't tuning in, and I find that remarkable. There's so much to learn here! It's a crash course in the Constitution, a great structure for organizing a government. It reminds me that I don't live in an intellectually curious country. What to do about it? For now, nothing."/>
			<outline text="At the same time, the public opinion polls make the biggest headlines. In other words, we ask the people who know the least to make the decision for us. Wow. Takes your breath away and makes me wonder if me and this country are going to part ways sometime soon. And of course it a true appreciation for the First Amendment, a lot of people are going to tell me to shut up for excercising my right to have an opinion."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I work in my own world, letting the Senate worry about the issue of the disposal of the president, staying somewhat separated from the decision they must make. We elected them to do that, and I have no choice but to trust them to do the right thing. "/>
			<outline text="And I guess that's the word I want to spread. The US Constitution says nothing about public opinion polls, and wisely so. I think the polls are too easily manipulated by television. This is a time to think and make hard decisions, for the people we elected, for the system we all agree on. "/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, I'm writing for the Frontier community, sort of like Clinton's and his State of the Union speech, and I wanted to share some of that writing with DaveNet readers. Some of the most popular DaveNet pieces are the ones that reveal the process of our company. I am aware that there's a lot of knowledge assumed in this piece that many DaveNet readers don't have. Please allow me some leeway here. (I'm talking like Henry Hyde!) I hope I'm not an annoyance in the bosom of the Internet!"/>
			<outline text="***Venting"/>
			<outline text="Last week, an important Frontier developer posted a controversial message on the Script Meridian community list, and it started a bit of venting, and instead of getting directly involved, I decided to unsubscribe from the list and read it thru the web-interface instead. It's good because the immediate temptation to respond is removed. I can't respond, I can only read. I've used this technique in the past to gain perspective and it works, for me at least."/>
			<outline text="As I read the messages I realized that we're largely in agreement, and we've been working quietly to address the problems for quite a few months. In this memo I hope to provide a update, a status report for Frontier developers on what UserLand has been doing in the latter part of 1998 and early 1999."/>
			<outline text="***Our search engine is open"/>
			<outline text="Our new search engine supports an interface that allows anyone to send an XML-RPC message containing the title of the page, the text on the page, its URL and the name of the website that contains the page. Within an hour of receipt of the message, the search engine adds the page to to the index. So, if you want to include your website in our search engine, it's a very small amount of work. Quite a few people have already done it. The call fits into your finalFilter script neatly, except for a small delay when rendering you hardly know it's being indexed, but it is."/>
			<outline text="This was a visionary thing for us to do for a couple of reasons. First, we're the first search engine to do this! Think of the possibilities, virtually instant indexing with no crawling. I truly believe that someday all search engines will work this way. And second, since the search engine we're developing is an integral part of Frontier 6, this open architecture will be an optional part of every Frontier-hosted content management system (or CMS). So there's no lock-in happening here. As soon as we release Frontier 6, anyone will be able to operate a distributed search engine."/>
			<outline text="We see the search engine as being the key idea to create a unified web presence for all information about Frontier, regardless of what website it's stored on. And then it can branch out and be the search engine for other focused communities, or it can be a standard-bearer, leading the way for Perl or Python-based search engines to implement compatible XML-RPC interfaces."/>
			<outline text="This is what I meant when I said on the Frontier-users list that there may be pieces of the puzzle that weren't evident at the time. It still may not be evident to many people. New ideas take a while to settle in and become ordinary. At one time or another every part of Frontier was this new and hard to understand. That's the way it goes."/>
			<outline text="***It's hard to find stuff"/>
			<outline text="But only if you don't use the search engine. We're providing two primary interfaces for content on our website, time and searching. The News pages and the calendar interfaces are the time interface, and search.userland.com is the search interface. If you remember you once saw something on one of our sites, now you can find it. You don't have to worry about where things are stored. Focus on the search engine as the primary way of finding things. That's how we're developing our docs as we go forward. As a web analyst and software designer, I watch where other sites are going. This is where they're going, and rightly so, and so are we."/>
			<outline text="***The docs are incomplete"/>
			<outline text="We have a formula for working with the Support Associates to fill in the holes. A major part of that process is the question and answer cycle on Script Meridian and Frontier-users. Just by asking a question on either of these lists you're helping to improve the docs. So please keep doing that."/>
			<outline text="Emmanuel has pointed out that Perl has better printed docs than Frontier. It's true. If we want our printed docs to get better, and we do, the first step is to organize and fill in the online docs. You can only get so far by lamenting the lack of docs. You've identified the problem. Now please help us solve it. All you have to do is search and ask questions when you don't find things. Let us worry about how the printed docs come about, that's part of our job."/>
			<outline text="***The Discussion Group interface"/>
			<outline text="Some people don't like the Discussion Group interface, but I do, because I see it differently. It's not at all like a mail list. It's a web interface into our content management system. This is a very popular idea for a lot of good reasons. Web browsers are ubiquitous and convenient. I have an Edit this Page button on my pages so I can go back and forth very quickly. And we have an XML-RPC interface in the works that connects from the DG to the new Frontier 6 outliner, so you lose no fidelity in editing tools, in fact you gain quite a lot. Think of the DG as a framework for group writing for a web presence you'll get the idea of what we're doing."/>
			<outline text="To think that somehow we're trying to replace Script Meridian is to completely miss the point of the DG. We're developing new software for you and your teams. It wouldn't work without the DG. And if you don't like the interface, cook your own. Make it work thru email. Go where ever you want. We want to establish a guest-database format for storing documents while they're in development by a web team. Content stored in the DG can be displayed thru any template you want to use. Users of your site may have no idea that your team is coordinating thru a web-interface. But having a collaborative web interface is key to running a dynamic site. All our competitors are moving this way. It's the right way to move!"/>
			<outline text="Why are we using it as forum software on userland.com? To burn it in, get user feedback, and to bootstrap our own internal workflow. We've already started to use it internally to manage our own web content. This is the necessary precursor to others using it in this mode."/>
			<outline text="***No breakage"/>
			<outline text="One thing that hasn't come up in this round of email is the subject of breakage. This is a big issue here at UserLand. Where there was a lot of breakage going from 4 to 5, the transition from 5 to 6 will be relatively simple and smoothe. "/>
			<outline text="We've added a lot of features to Frontier server-side, but the new features are all implemented in a single responder that runs alongside the responders you already have. And when you decide to move a .wsf site from 5 to 6, you'll find the path is well-paved with simple instructions and a troubleshooting checklist, and the experience of twenty or thirty well-known Frontier gods and godesses to help you as you get started."/>
			<outline text="It's part of our slow-down-and-get-it-right philosophy that has been a key part of our development process since we went commercial last summer."/>
			<outline text="***Working with outside authors"/>
			<outline text="We can avoid discontinuities with book authors by slowing down and carefully specifying the software interfaces. That's exactly what we've been doing. We know that these problems are not insurmountable, in fact we know how to do it, having shipped commercial software continuously for the last twenty years. "/>
			<outline text="We've worked with a dozen book authors in that timeframe, every one is different, but they all have common needs, to know where we're working and where we're going. And vice versa, we also need to know where they're working and where they're going. "/>
			<outline text="So our process is open to anyone who has a book contract, or who knows Frontier deeply and wants us to help them sell a book. We will open our process and coordinate our work with book authors."/>
			<outline text="But I want to stress this, the number one thing we can do is to ship complete online docs for new functionality. We're doing that with Frontier 6. When we ship it, you will find that the howtos are already written, and that detailed specs are available. There won't be guesswork. You'll know how the software works if you read the docs."/>
			<outline text="***You can get in the loop if you want to"/>
			<outline text="Here's where you make a decision about how smoothe a ride you want."/>
			<outline text="If you want a really smoothe ride on Frontier 6, then wait, and we'll let you know that we're confident that it'll go smoothly for you."/>
			<outline text="However, if you want to get an idea of what we're doing, read the docs. They're on the developer's site. Start on the home page and then dive into each of the subjects. Like all new things, it may take two or more readings for the ideas to sink in, to see how everything is related, how the search engine connects to the content, as does the calendar, and guest databases, membership, profiling, etc."/>
			<outline text="But we still have some time before Frontier 6 ships. Ask questions, ask for clarification, use the search engine (all the material on the developer site is indexed), and use any communication medium that you're comfortable with, except we ask that you not use the Frontier-users list because this is outside its charter. Once this stuff ships, that will the appropriate time to discuss it on Frontier-users. That's why we started the Frontier-server list to support the initial group of testers for Frontier 6. And, as far as UserLand is concerned, you may if you want use the Script Meridian list to ask questions about Frontier 6. If the members of SM decide that's OK, then go for it, otherwise use the Frontier-server list or the Discussion group."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Java Loses Netscape&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/24/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Last week, talking with several Netscape people, they told me privately that Netscape's commitment to Java was over. "/>
			<outline text="In the future, they would provide APIs that allow operating system vendors such as Microsoft, Sun or Apple to hook Java virtual machines into their web browsing software, but Netscape will not take responsibility for porting and maintaining the Java virtual machine for all the operating systems they support."/>
			<outline text="Late last night, the San Jose Mercury-News broke the story."/>
			<outline text="http://www.sjmercury.com/business/center/netscapejava012498.htm "/>
			<outline text="***History"/>
			<outline text="We're at a juncture here. A loop is unwinding. It was Netscape's commitment to Java that put it on the map in 1995. That endorsement is over. "/>
			<outline text="Java didn't become the ubiquitous web content format that people widely predicted it would. It's no longer reasonable to argue that someday it will. "/>
			<outline text="In late 1997, in a phone conversation with Bill Gates, I asked why they didn't give Java back to Sun and take it out of Windows? Let Sun have exclusive development responsibility for Java? Wouldn't that be easier than fighting a lengthy legal battle with Sun? "/>
			<outline text="His response was that they needed Java to keep MSIE competitive with Navigator. Now that reason has gone away. Microsoft may or may not give Java back to Sun, but their primary reason to continue to invest in Java is gone."/>
			<outline text="***Balance"/>
			<outline text="Now we have to wonder, who's going to balance Microsoft? There was a short euphoric period when the Internet, and Microsoft's lack of presence in it, fed an enormous creative energy and independence. Netscape was at the center of that euphoria. "/>
			<outline text="It's the same answer it always was. The secret is working together. Win-wins. Large companies partnering with small ones, leveraging off each other's strengths. This is what Microsoft is not good at. This is the zig to Microsoft's zag. "/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates, in a BusinessWeek interview, points out that IBM has ten times the number of people as Microsoft. Sun has almost as much revenue as Microsoft. Apple has 25 million users. "/>
			<outline text="For every Microsoft-owned content format, there are competitive formats with just as much following. An example -- Microsoft has NetShow, and there's RealAudio and QuickTime, neither of which is owned by Microsoft. MacroMedia has Flash and Shockwave. What does Microsoft have?"/>
			<outline text="Further, Microsoft does not have a dominant position in content development tools, in fact, Microsoft is barely present in this market! There's so much juice there, so much unorganized balance."/>
			<outline text="But the big companies do it wrong, they don't do win-wins with smaller companies. Unfortunately for them, the really good independent thinking non-Microsoft developers work at the smaller companies. "/>
			<outline text="To counterbalance Microsoft you need an army of highly incentivized independent developers producing exciting software."/>
			<outline text="The venture capital model is weak at providing balance to Microsoft. They produce some hits, mostly misses. The CEOs they hire are not grounded in technology, they make good IPO roadshows, but in the end the companies become Microsoft roadkill. Their Act One is good, but two, three and four are weak or non-existent. This happens because the companies try to be Microsoft. You can't, there already is a Microsoft, and they're very good at being that."/>
			<outline text="Let's learn from the Netscape experience. Their natural grounding was in the content developer world. The leader of Netscape should have been someone skilled in building websites, someone who loves the medium, who speaks the language and understands the issues of content people: writers, artists, designers and geeks. That person would have known how to zig to Microsoft's zag. It's testimony to the weakness of the VC model that Microsoft could capture the hill in web browsers even though their technologists don't do websites."/>
			<outline text="***Armies of unpaid developers"/>
			<outline text="The most common analyst quote in response to the Netscape release of source code says that an &quot;army of unpaid developers&quot; will now be available to Navigator, an army that won't be available to Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="I'm sure Microsoft can come up with an answer to that and it's not even the issue. Individual programmers may have artistic reasons to want to improve Navigator, but most great programmers insist on getting paid for their work. I wouldn't bet too heavily on an army of unpaid developers. "/>
			<outline text="But who has the money to support a bunch of competitive efforts to improve the browser world, and to provide realistic balance to Microsoft's strength?"/>
			<outline text="The answer is IBM or Intel or Cisco or TCI or any cash rich media company that thinks the Internet is an important part of their future. Or even the Silicon Valley venture capitalists could invest in a company with a non-traditional spreadsheet, for strategic reasons."/>
			<outline text="Let's work out the economics, build another brand name that people can respect, an alternative to Microsoft, built out of brains and passion for art and choice and competition."/>
			<outline text="We, the software industry, can solve this problem. "/>
			<outline text="***Let's do something"/>
			<outline text="The Netscape people could see the writing on the wall. "/>
			<outline text="They didn't want to take the source code for Navigator down with their corporate ship. "/>
			<outline text="Their choice, to release the source for Navigator, was an act of unusual generosity. "/>
			<outline text="Let's do something with that. "/>
			<outline text="***Off to Palm Springs"/>
			<outline text="Tomorrow I'm off to Palm Springs for Microsoft's Web Tech Ed conference."/>
			<outline text="I'm going to spend a lot of time hanging out with Microsoft people in the next few days. No doubt we have interesting stuff to talk about. "/>
			<outline text="So this is probably the last DaveNet piece till Wednesday or Thursday. I'll take good notes and let you know what happened in Palm Springs and in this incredible world we live in."/>
			<outline text="***Frontier 5"/>
			<outline text="A final note."/>

			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail980124.html "/>
			<outline text="Many people view Netscape's decision as good news for Java, not bad. Developers weren't happy with Netscape's Java. Many people prefer Microsoft's approach, in MSIE, of giving the user the choice of which Java virtual machine to run. I understand this point of view, and agree with it. "/>
			<outline text="That's one of the reasons it's gratifying to run DaveNet and Scripting News. We get to the root of technical issues very quicky. I provide a point of view, people respond -- learning happens, mistakes can be avoided and loops can be shortened."/>

			<outline text="A quick DaveNet, a trip report on Palm Springs, some news about the Frontier 5 release, and an email exchange with Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems about Java."/>
			<outline text="***Palm Springs"/>
			<outline text="I had a great time. Lots of meetings, and web energy is back in the developer community thanks to Netscape's decision to release the source to Navigator. Developers are paying attention. The next few steps they make will be crucial. More on that later. "/>
			<outline text="I took three walks in Palm Springs. It's a fairly poor town. I was surprised. The growth in the area has been in the Arizona-like towns of Indian Wells and Palm Desert. They're rich towns, Palm Springs got left behind, and that gives the place a great deal of charm, I think."/>
			<outline text="I stayed at the Racquet Club and rented a big car, a Mercury Marquis. The days were warm, but not quite hot. When the sun was out it was blazing and strong, and the air was clear, and very dry. I liked my walks, I felt like I was in an exotic place. Such big mountains. Such easy air to breathe."/>
			<outline text="***As Good As It Gets"/>
			<outline text="On Sunday night I went to the movies with a friend. The movie was 'As Good as it Gets' starring Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson. It's a guy's chick movie! The first one I've ever seen. Luckily I went to see it with a woman, so the discussion afterward gave me a chance to talk about the movie from a male perspective, to say what I wanted women to see in this story."/>
			<outline text="Most chick movies end with the guy being a jerk and the woman being good, and either putting up with it (happy ending) or giving up (not happy). In this one, the man has something to say, does the usual thing (shuts up) and the woman still gives him grief. At one point Nicholson says &quot;This is exhausting!&quot; (I agree) and Hunt comes closer and hassles him. Oh geez."/>
			<outline text="In the end she sort of accepts his right to have a point of view. The neat thing about it is that the movie leaves us unsettled about the woman and leaves us loving the man! I like that, an unusual story, one that makes me feel optimistic about the future, if women (and men) get the message that it's great for us to simply be ourselves with our friends and lovers."/>
			<outline text="I've read a bunch of reviews of the movie, and no one seems to get this. Hunt is a great actor! She played the role usually reserved for the male lead in a love story. And Nicholson was stunning as an extremely opinionated man who we learn to love."/>
			<outline text="***The Frontier 5 presentation"/>
			<outline text="I did a presentation and demo at the Microsoft show, as planned."/>
			<outline text="It was far from the best demo I ever did. Oh well. The product performed flawlessly and I think people came away understanding what it does. So that makes it a success. I usually do much better. But... onward!"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/slideshows/palmSprings/slide01.html "/>
			<outline text="The slide show looks best if you can zoom your browser full screen."/>
			<outline text="***New shipdate "/>
			<outline text="We've decided to push the Frontier 5.0 shipdate back to Friday, January 30. We believe the software we have now is solid, and that it will be the actual shipping 5.0. However, we made some last-minute changes, and feel it's prudent to wait a couple of days to determine if we've broken anything essential in the last few builds."/>
			<outline text="***Email with Bill Joy"/>
			<outline text="When I got home from Palm Springs an interesting email from Sun founder Bill Joy was waiting; apparently in response to &quot;Good News for Java?&quot; An exchange followed. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/98/01/stories/emailWithBillJoyAtSun.html  "/>
			<outline text="Conclusions? I didn't say Sun should free Java. But the fact that it is not free determines a lot about where Java can go. It's clear that Sun is serious about Write Once Run Anywhere. That imposes restrictions on what the licensees can do. We'll see if the market rewards them for this strategy or not. "/>

			<outline text="Now is a really good time to discuss capital punishment."/>
			<outline text="On Tuesday Karla Faye Tucker, a cruel murderer who is also a woman, is set to be executed by the state of Texas, presumably with the approval or acquiesence of the US Supreme Court. Her gender forces us to look at state-administered killing in a different way. "/>
			<outline text="I'm sorry to use Ms. Tucker in this way, but anything that gets us to look more closely at the justice of a government killing its own people, is useful. Listening to her talk on TV I imagine that she wouldn't mind. And it's better to talk about it while she's still alive and can add to the discussion. After she's dead, after next Tuesday, she won't be able to talk to us at all."/>
			<outline text="I've written about capital punishment many times before. I'm not sure I've made the point clearly enough. Here's my problem. In the United States, since I am a citizen, I am part of the government. That's how it works here. Goverment of the people, by the people, for the people. "/>
			<outline text="The government is killing Ms. Tucker. That means that I am killing Ms. Tucker. It's as if I'm pulling the switch that will start the poison flowing thru her veins. I am responsible for her death under the moral code of the United States of America."/>
			<outline text="Like many other citizens, I believe that a higher force determines when it's time for us to die. By participating in the killing of a human being, I am being forced to cross a sacred line, to break one of the most important tenets of my personal philosophy. "/>
			<outline text="The death penalty *is* cruel and unusual punishment. For me. What crime did I commit to deserve this punishment? This makes me angry! Very deeply angry."/>
			<outline text="The bottom-line for me, when the government kills someone, we all have the blood on our hands. Speaking for myself only, I don't want that."/>

			<outline text="I only knew my uncle Sam as a child. He was a distant man, very dark, but when I was a kid, we were friends. He showed me how to cook. He painted for me. I think he liked me. "/>
			<outline text="If he hadn't been murdered, it's possible that he would be alive now, and my life might be richer. Regardless, he's part of my family, and his death was wrong! "/>
			<outline text="I feel deeply sad for poor Sam Winer, to leave this life in such an awful way. There was no mercy or forgiveness for Sam in his final moment. No kindness or love. The last face he saw was someone who was going to kill him."/>
			<outline text="They never caught Sam's killers. "/>
			<outline text="But if they had, I would want to see them punished."/>
			<outline text="But there's no way I would want them killed."/>
			<outline text="There's no way we can bring Sam back, but maybe his death can help save another human life, and at the same time preserve the dignity of people like me, who believe killing is a sin, no matter who's doing it, no matter what the reason."/>

			<outline text="What if we really listened to her? Would we learn something? You bet we would."/>
			<outline text="An important point -- we can hate what she did, and still forgive her. It's in the teachings of many religions. The power of redemption. Rising above our nature. Overcoming our past, and then becoming greater, cleaner, more free, more human."/>
			<outline text="If listening to this makes you want to shut me up, consider that I never killed anyone and I don't support what she did. Look deep into this, because it says something about your fear. "/>
			<outline text="***The Larry King interview"/>
			<outline text="I believe we have the most to learn from the people we want to listen to the least."/>
			<outline text="It's so hard to listen to someone who did such a horrible thing, and has such a horrible, unimaginable, future. At one point, watching the Larry King interview, I became sure she was going to be executed. I could feel my skin become electric, because I was sure she realized it too. "/>
			<outline text="It's OK if you didn't want to hear her life story, if you want to dehumanize her (so you could kill her?), but the TV camera betrays you. She *was* a human being, she sought our forgiveness, which we never had the time to give her, because we were too busy debating whether we would kill her. "/>
			<outline text="No, it wasn't about her gender or her looks, it was about her courage. She kept her cool. She had the guts to ask for our forgiveness, for our mercy, for our clemency. "/>
			<outline text="If we could have let her live, even considering the horror of what she did, it would have made us greater. I feel deep shame at being part of a country with such a shallow collective heart, with such a brutal response to brutality, with no sense of forgiveness."/>
			<outline text="I have friends, some who I love very much, who favor the death penalty. This doesn't stop me from loving them, and wanting to understand. But as I respect their right to their point of view, I ask them to consider where I'm coming from. "/>

			<outline text="Yes, murder with an axe is a terrible thing. Hopefully we can all agree with that."/>

Do you wake up with a smile on your face knowing that a violent criminal got the punishment you felt she deserved? Do you forgive her now that she's paid the price?"/>

I find this meditative, even after all these years, it's calming to watch people and robots from all over the world crawling my site."/>
			<outline text="Very quietly, no loud bang, all the lights went out, except for the servers and routers, which are battery-powered. The monitors went out. It became quiet as fans powered down. I could hear the drops of rain on the roof. The power didn't flicker. There was no indecision. It's as if my electricity went off just as my personal electricity went off."/>
			<outline text="When I came back this morning, the lights were on. I rebooted my servers, checked my email, got some coffee, turned on the music and started working."/>
			<outline text="***Reasoning with me"/>
			<outline text="Of course yesterday's piece got quite a bit of mail. There were two popular themes. One was the gender issue, why pay any particular attention to this case just because the condemned person was a woman? "/>
			<outline text="I dealt with that part of it in &quot;Male Anger&quot;, in early January. No, it's not cool that we offer protection to women, and vengeance to men. Nonetheless I wanted to write about this because it was getting a lot of attention in the US. It was a chance to talk, when people are more open, more likely to listen."/>
			<outline text="The second popular response was about &quot;you can't reason with me&quot;. I stand by it. Reasoning gets me one percent to my answer. Listening to my heart gets me the other 99 percent. Some issues in life are so complex that reasoning doesn't work. The answer is still available, but it requires that I let my intellect take a back seat. Sometimes it can be hard to hear what a heart is saying. But strong emotional situations make it much easier. Something is revealed. You can't reason with my experience, neither can I."/>
			<outline text="It's like saying it's raining outside here. It is. You can't argue with it. You may be able to reason with it at some level (why is it raining? when will it stop?) but you can't change it. Emotions and intuition work the same way. My opinions, of course."/>
			<outline text="***The Cathedral and the Bazaar"/>

			<outline text="http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html "/>
			<outline text="I wrote a brief off-the-top-of-the-head response to the piece and posted it on my site on Monday. I got enough email to learn some more."/>
			<outline text="First, Raymond is a great writer, and thinks clearly. His rules are worth studying by everyone who hopes to make software, either as an individual effort or as part of a commercial team."/>
			<outline text="He does his development for free, with other people who work for free. I agree with part of his argument, in my experience, great programmers are great whether or not they are paid for their work. Lots of programmers say they want to get rich, but the really good ones do it for the juice of creating something wonderful to play with and to express themselves. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/05/Programmers.html "/>
			<outline text="I think programmers are truth seekers, scientists who know how to ask questions and solve problems. Money doesn't make them tick. But read on, money *is* part of the programming world."/>
			<outline text="***No panacea"/>
			<outline text="I've lived in a world of public collaborative programming for eight years, not a lifetime, but enough time to have learned some about it. In many ways our world is quite similar to the one Raymond describes."/>
			<outline text="From my point of view, it's no panacea. People come and go, as Raymond explains in his piece. If they decide to pass off, then progress might continue, depending on the quality of the work, and the commitment of the new owner of the code. "/>
			<outline text="But the pass-off point can be a difficult time. Big pieces of functionality freeze while you wait to find out if the author is coming back into the loop. Sometimes when you ask for custody, they yell at you! I often back off when that happens. Or if you ask people to stay out of your way, they don't. And sometimes they ask me to back off, and I forget. Collisions. Flames. Anger! Human nature..."/>
			<outline text="Also being the leader of a development community can be a mixed experience. People tend to give you a lot of their angst. The failings of the team or community are sometimes passed up the hierarchy. It gets old quickly, especially when you've already learned the lessons from the last generation, and a new one wants to take you thru it all over again. Sometimes I wish the superstars would just stick around to coach the new superstars on how to deal with me. [Mason, are you listening? Meet Preston, Seth, Matt, Jim, Bijan, Phil, and...]"/>
			<outline text="Eventually, we learned it's our responsibility to make sure we can move forward. If we want our software to be used, we have to invest in usability. Software design issues become more complex when user interfaces appear. Matters of taste matter less, and the judgement of a designer must take over. Community is a very weak environment for tweaking a user interface to make it more accessible to new users. The community is already up the learning curve. The things you give to new users often break the systems built by the established users."/>
			<outline text="But I'm not giving up on collaborative programming. No way! I feel in many ways we're just getting started."/>
			<outline text="***The role of money"/>
			<outline text="I've learned that people I've been able to rely most on are the ones I pay salaries to. I don't think this should come as a surprise. The net is wonderful, but it didn't change the economy. People still have to eat, and programmers in Silicon Valley can eat well if they shop for jobs. In other words, programmers can do work they love *and* make good money. Why should they work for free? "/>
			<outline text="Sometimes teamwork is required to make something happen. That means people have to accept the judgement of someone else. This works better when the person making the call is paying the person implementing the decision. It may work other ways, your mileage may vary, I know at times it can be incredibly difficult to get people on a payroll to move. Just ask anyone who managed at Apple. Read Jim Carlton's book. No matter what, teamwork is hard to attain in the software world of the late 1990s. It's just easier if people are being paid. Maybe not all people, maybe not at all times."/>
			<outline text="***User interfaces"/>
			<outline text="As far as I can tell, all the software that's been developed in the Linux world which Raymond describes, is pretty faceless stuff. My experience is that the expensive part of software development is the user interface. Editors, browsers, dialogs, even runtimes, in the commercial world are deeper, more useful, more tuned, than the ones gathered around Linux. Maybe I missed something? If so, please send me pointers to bazaar-model software with complex, highly effective user interfaces. I want to understand how this really works."/>
			<outline text="***The high road"/>
			<outline text="My first reaction to Cathedral and Bazaar was pretty negative. I left it on the web, as-is, so you can see how my point of view shifted over a few days."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/98/02/stories/commentsOnCathedralsAndBaz.html "/>
			<outline text="The people from the bazaar community can sound threatening to the ears of a commercial developer like myself, who has invested a lot of time and money in developing a big piece of software. That's just feedback. Now that I've had a chance to reflect (the power outages helped!) I see things a bit differently."/>
			<outline text="I'd like to see if we can get our interests aligned, so that our power can connect to their power and vice versa. We share an interest in having a platform without a platform vendor. To the extent that they have set up a system that operates differently from Apple's, Microsoft's and Sun's (and Macromedia, Oracle and AOL too), I wish them more power. "/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, if a requirement to being friends is that I adopt their philosophy in total, the answer is no. That was Java's message. I'd rather take my chances with Windows, where the market is proven and the platform vendor will talk and listen to me, without forcing me to change my model, and (important!) where my software already works."/>
			<outline text="***Community"/>
			<outline text="Part of what we do belongs in the world that Raymond describes, and part of it belongs in the commercial world. Where are the lines? With Frontier it's pretty simple, I think. Everything that ships with Frontier is on our side of the line. Everything that's available thru other servers and mail lists follows the rules established by their authors. They can choose to use any model they like."/>
			<outline text="In other words, we make our product, and we do the best we can to say what that is. There are huge places where we don't develop, where we don't have the people or money to develop. Those places are relatively safe. Then there are areas where we focus, like content management systems, and anything that relates to those areas being worked on by salaried people who are responsible to a company's management for producing results."/>
			<outline text="Our community is an incubator for defining these lines. We're at another transition point, it's an interesting time. I'd like to extend an offer to people to work with us not only as a software company, but as a community of users, of peers. People making products."/>
			<outline text="***Compatibility"/>
			<outline text="Even if we don't port to Linux, we can still acknowledge Linux by building compatibility bridges to software that runs on Linux. For example, we could partner with people who are working on content systems on Linux to build ways to connect to our software running on Windows and Mac."/>
			<outline text="I believe websites are LANs, not operating systems. If you can use a database on Linux that connects to our database on Windows or Mac, that's almost as good as having our software on Linux. We're looking for projects we can collaborate on to build and document these kinds of compatibilities."/>
			<outline text="Further, I've heard about a compatibility layer in Linux called WINE that allows Windows apps to run on Linux. Can we connect our communities to find out where the problems are in running Frontier 5/Win on WINE? Once we know where the problems are, we can try to work around them. WINE will get better too, because Frontier is a good test case for Windows compatibility, and it will get better at this over time. It's still early in the process so the task is probably not huge right now. And the sooner we get started, the sooner we'll deliver results."/>
			<outline text="This is a perfect community-to-community project. UserLand would be happy to support it in any way we can."/>
			<outline text="I guess what I'm saying is that even though we're not in position to produce a version of our software for Linux right now, we can start creating a friendship, and learn how our stuff can play better with their stuff, and keep looking at new ways to empower each other."/>
			<outline text="How does this sound?"/>
			<outline text="***A mixture"/>
			<outline text="I think it makes sense for the Linux platform to host a mixture of different kinds of development efforts. "/>
			<outline text="Certainly Apache has been a huge success as a free development project. But I believe to make it to the next level, there has to be some really friendly colorful software that works reliably and that's easy to install. "/>
			<outline text="I believe for that to happen you need to attract people who don't work for free. And to get them to work on the platform will require investors."/>
			<outline text="***Where to look?"/>
			<outline text="IBM is still pushing OS/2."/>
			<outline text="Sun is still betting on Java OS."/>
			<outline text="I think even Microsoft, with its anti-trust troubles could support a competitive OS. I think their support of the Mac OS has a lot to do with that."/>
			<outline text="Linux seems to have what other OSes don't. A committment to an open playing field. No ownership of the OS. Is it worth it for the software industry to take a detour to make sure something solid happens here? "/>
			<outline text="It's not for me to decide. Look to the backers of the Kleiner-Perkins Java Fund for a clue to who might be interested in funding commercial-level development of apps that run on Linux."/>
			<outline text="http://www.kpcb.com/keiretsu/JavaFund.html "/>
			<outline text="***Netscape"/>
			<outline text="Finally, Netscape, apparently, is shopping for someone to buy them. Perhaps, instead of disappearing inside another big corporation, Netscape could leverage its reputation for leadership in open software by becoming the corporate caretaker of Linux? "/>
			<outline text="Maybe they could do this with IBM, Sun and Microsoft's support?"/>
			<outline text="It's just a wacky idea."/>

			<outline text="***Exonerated?"/>
			<outline text="On Saturday, the President's defenders used a new word. Exonerate. The spin doctors are going to have a lovely time with this word. The President is exonerated. The rest of the world wonders what the fuss was about. Perfect ammo for the President's spin doctors. We'll deal with that later. "/>
			<outline text="Meantime, the CNN scoop, reported here last week, is now the ABC News scoop. (How come no one else paid attention when Byrd said the same things on CNN on Wednesday? Interesting..)"/>
			<outline text="***Byrd on ABC"/>
			<outline text="Robert Byrd, the Democrat Senator from West Virginia said on Sunday &quot;I have no doubt that he has given false testimony under oath and that he has misled the American people. There are indications that he did indeed obstruct justice.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="He continued, &quot;It will be very difficult to stand and say 'not guilty' -- very difficult. Who's kidding whom here? I have to live with myself. I have to live with my conscience. And I have to live with the Constitution.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***The exit strategy"/>
			<outline text="Now there's the cross-party cue. The exit strategy for Republicans and Democrats. If you're tired of the debate, just get into agreement with Byrd. Who's kidding whom here? Exactly. I couldn't have said it better myself."/>
			<outline text="The beauty of the Constitution is that it forces a decision, so no matter how the Senators try to wiggle out of it, the impeachment process is a cul-de-sac, as Byrd says. Yay or nay, guilty or not, he stays or goes. There's no shade of gray possible. "/>
			<outline text="The Constitution versus the Spin Doctors. The TV generation versus a Tough Decision. Professional wrestling versus the real thing. They say the vote will come later this week. I, for one, find it fascinating, even riveting. By standing up and saying so maybe I'll give courage to others who want to participate as our elected government tears up the Constitution and reinvents our legal system."/>
			<outline text="***Unanswered questions"/>
			<outline text="Last night watching Larry King again, I wanted to ask Louisiana Democrat John Breaux a question."/>
			<outline text="He said Clinton did horrible things, a common theme repeated by many Clinton advocates. But they never elaborate. Does Larry King know his job? He's supposed to ask a tough question here. Mr. Breaux, you just said the President did horrible things. For the record, what are they?"/>
			<outline text="The Democrats want to elaborate, after they vote to acquit. That's too convenient. That's the faceoff between legal responsibility and spin. According to their plan, censure, which has no legal standing, and can be withdrawn when the Democrats control the Senate, is all that prevents future presidents from perjury and obstructing justice. Sorry, with all due respect, I don't believe it will do that. "/>
			<outline text="***So much more to say"/>
			<outline text="Our political system has changed. Instead of  three branches, executive, legislative and judicial, it's now a feedback loop implemented thru television. The spinners make the poll numbers go up by figuring out what people want to hear and saying it. What they do may have nothing to do with what they say. The poll numbers become the news story. (Meta-news, news about the news!) Anything that gets in the way is ground up. Anyone who disagrees is labeled as a crazy radical. The polls buy it. This is Al Gore's version of wisdom. &lt;i&gt;Pfui!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
			<outline text="I believed all the crap they told us in school about the strong moral ground that this country was built on. I held that belief thru Vietnam and Nixon because we ended the war and forced the President from office. The Constitution was challenged then too, Vietnam was an illegal war and the President tried to subvert the political system. We won that round. But maybe our country was always crazy, as some people believe, maybe the Constitution was always a lie. None of us can really know."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, never mind what the Constitution was in the past, what do we want it to be in the future? Here's what I believe: we can't afford to negotiate with our President on this level. Clinton, if he had any honor, if he loved our country, would have resigned last summer before the grand jury testimony. Instead he chose perjury. Anything that happened after that was the rest of us trying to rescue what's left of our honor and pride in our country from a greedy self-centered person who wants the legal system to stoop to embrace his illegal behavior. I won't stand by and let our system be turned around this way without fighting. "/>
			<outline text="***Cutting thru the noise"/>
			<outline text="Behind all the noise, here's what's really going on. One of our three branches of government, the judicial system, is undermined. That's what perjury and obstruction of justice are about. "/>
			<outline text="If you value free speech, remember, the courts were all that stood in the way of the wildly unconstitutional Communication Decency Act. "/>
			<outline text="You can still count on the judicial system, to some degree, to interpret the Constitution with courage and intelligence. Eventually they will break too, as the Presidency and Congress has, if they don't have our support."/>
			<outline text="***I want answers"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to respect the censure advocates. To do so, I need them to answer some questions."/>
			<outline text="Please state clearly the new rules of Presidential conduct after Clinton is exonerated. When are presidents allowed to lie and obstruct justice? What laws do they not have to obey? "/>
			<outline text="Before we finally restructure our government, let's think it thru and debate as intelligent respectful adults instead of sweeping it away. Has this country been good to you? Then be good to it. Ask the questions."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Learning from Newbies&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/10/98; 6:42:43 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I've been meeting with new users over the last few weeks, in several different contexts. Here's what I've learned so far."/>
			<outline text="***Marc Learns Frontier 5"/>
			<outline text="As soon as my longtime friend Marc Canter saw Frontier running on Windows, he got excited. He started coming over for demos. Every few days we'd sit down for a couple of hours and I'd take him thru a single facet of Frontier. By now we've covered pretty much everything you can do with Frontier on Windows."/>
			<outline text="Midway thru the process we installed Frontier on his system, and changed roles. He would do the typing, and I would guide him thru the commands and keystrokes to get Frontier to do what he wanted to do. "/>
			<outline text="In the last week he's been working on his site with no help from me! Now he's teaching other people at his company, VenueMedia, how to contribute to his site. It's amazing to be part of this. I had never done it before. It opens my eyes. "/>
			<outline text="The next milestone we'll reach is that I'll point to something on Marc's site, and then you can see the world he's creating. He and his team do the most incredible DHTML and ASPs I've seen. Money and art, we're going to mix it up, his world and mine. You'll see his DHTML magic showing up in my sites. That's why it's worth it to me to help Marc climb the hill."/>
			<outline text="Another reason is that Marc is also an accomplished software designer. So his narration of his difficulties comes with a deep understanding of and appreciation for the problems of UI design. I often say to him &quot;You should have seen how this worked in Frontier 4!&quot; We both have a good laugh. It's about making software. There's always room for improvement."/>
			<outline text="***Demos"/>
			<outline text="I've also been doing demos. I have this great new laptop. I bring it with me to all my meetings. Sometimes I get a sense that I could do a good demo for the people I'm meeting with, so I pull out the laptop and start. "/>
			<outline text="I can now do a good ten minute demo of Frontier. If the people have experience working on websites I can show them the benefits of templates, link management and macros, and the object oriented framework; all in ten minutes. "/>
			<outline text="I can get people excited with this software in (almost) the same way I could get people excited by MORE in 1986. My demo will get better."/>
			<outline text="***How to improve the software"/>
			<outline text="I know how to improve Frontier to make it fun to learn, and much easier. I understand where the roadblocks are now. It's still a scripting environment with a website framework added into it. The integration is more complete in 5.0, but to go the next step, the File menu will have to know about websites. "/>
			<outline text="The idea of starting fresh with something new is what's missing in Frontier 5. The object database can be both enticing and frightening. I want to get it even further out of people's way. Make it something you can open to get a glimpse at all the power, but have it neatly out of your way for all your daily work."/>
			<outline text="Net-net: We're a lot closer to this ideal in Frontier 5, but we still have a way to go."/>
			<outline text="***In the meantime"/>
			<outline text="If you want to quickly get to the heart of Frontier as a web content management system, here's how to do it."/>
			<outline text="1. Launch the Frontier application. Choose New Website from the Web menu. Enter the name of your new site, call it Testing. Click on OK."/>
			<outline text="2. A new table opens containing several items, #filters, #ftpSite, #glossary, #images, #prefs, #template and #tools."/>
			<outline text="3. Press the Enter key (Return on Mac). A new line opens. Type default and press Enter."/>
			<outline text="4. Double-click on the gray triangle to the left of the new line. A dialog appears. Choose outline or wp-text. Click on Zoom. A window opens. Type Hello World. Leave this window in front. "/>
			<outline text="5. Choose Publish Page from the Web menu. If this is the first page you've published, a dialog may appear asking you to locate your web browser app."/>
			<outline text="6. The web browser comes to the front, displaying the page."/>
			<outline text="This is the pattern. This is how I create new pages in Frontier every day, in exactly this way. Once you get in this groove, you're at the heart of the power. When you change the #template you change the layout of all the pages in this website. As you build new pages the #glossary fills up with easy ways to point to other pieces on your website. Macros and renderers that come with Frontier make it easy to do the things that *should* be easy."/>
			<outline text="It's there, we just have to show it to people more easily."/>
			<outline text="***Brain dumps"/>
			<outline text="I don't mind sitting down once a day for the next few months and writing up one of these recipes for success with Frontier. I have two questions from here: How do we organize this stuff? And how can I encourage other people to do the same? "/>
			<outline text="I want to do a brain dump, once and for all, of everything I know about Frontier that could help an excited newbie climb the curve. I want everyone else to do this too. I want to create a permanent resource, so we can tackle bigger problems on the mailing lists."/>
			<outline text="***A buddy system?"/>
			<outline text="I've found if I stay nearby someone new, and be patient, anyone who does websites can learn Frontier, and we can both enjoy the learning process."/>
			<outline text="Now the question is, how do we get to the next level, so that the learning materials are good enough so that it doesn't require the president of the company to be there while the person is learning the software?"/>
			<outline text="(An aside, at least a thousand people have been successful with only the help offered by the docs and mailing lists. It's certainly not impossible to get thru the materials that we provide. But not everyone does get thru it.)"/>
			<outline text="One possible solution is to organize a buddy system. A newbie shows up, is having trouble understanding the concepts. Mail isn't helping, the docs aren't either. The person is motivated, they know they need Frontier. But they need personal help."/>
			<outline text="I've done this with two people. It's very rewarding. It teaches me a lot. Is there any interest in this idea either among newbies or experienced Frontier people? As I envision it, the primary method of communication, at first, would be over the phone. The new person pays the phone bill, makes the call. The experienced person walks them thru an example. Followup via email. Another call. "/>
			<outline text="When it's done, both the teacher and the student write up a report, saying what they learned, where the stumbling blocks were. A narrative that other teachers and students can read."/>
			<outline text="I would find this enormously helpful in charting the course for the future of Frontier."/>
			<outline text="***Two frustrations"/>
			<outline text="It frustrates me that I write good docs sometimes when I'm typing into my emailer, but then the good writing is lost in a threading structure on some archive somewhere (I can never remember where they are!)."/>
			<outline text="It frustrates me when I read a great message posted by someone else and feel &quot;That should be on the website!&quot; because there is no place to put it, and no way to organize it so that new users will find the information when they need it."/>
			<outline text="***The web is better?"/>
			<outline text="When I write something on the web it's more permanent and more visible than mailing list stuff. More people read it, a lot more than the people who are subscribed to the Frontier mailing lists."/>
			<outline text="But after it scrolls off the Scripting News home page, it will be lost in the archives. Let's say I can teach you something about Frontier now, but what about the people who come thru here a month from now, how will they find it?"/>
			<outline text="We get complaints all the time about the organization of the learning materials for Frontier. They're all over the place, spread over four different websites! A lot of the material is obsolete. We know there's a problem, but how to solve it?"/>
			<outline text="***Mailing lists as learning environments"/>
			<outline text="I think mailing lists are over-rated as learning environments. "/>
			<outline text="I think a combination of mailing lists and websites is the way to go."/>
			<outline text="After all, many of the people who use Frontier use it to build websites."/>
			<outline text="Can we leverage that in some way?"/>
			<outline text="***Models?"/>
			<outline text="The solution will be mix of stuff, indices, narratives, case studies, searching and an easy way to add new knowledge and software to the system."/>
			<outline text="The key is how it is presented. A learning center home page that grows in a manageable way, that allows the most people to contribute, and has the greatest possible degree of clarity and accuracy and completeness."/>
			<outline text="A &quot;best practices&quot; enclyclopedia that makes it easy to get the answers quickly."/>
			<outline text="It's also important that we can snapshot the website for downloading. That's the most common request for our docs."/>
			<outline text="That's what I'm thinking about now. I see problems everywhere. It's time to solve them. "/>
			<outline text="***It's about empowerment"/>
			<outline text="The biggest question for me is how to empower everyone who knows a lot about Frontier to teach people who want to know a lot about Frontier."/>
			<outline text="There's the crux of the problem..."/>
			<outline text="Onward!"/>
			<outline text="Now here's a surprise..."/>
			<outline text="***Thank heaven for Apache"/>
			<outline text="I don't know who else to thank, since we all own the Apache web server. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.apache.org/ "/>
			<outline text="It was just last week that I was asking questions about free software and Linux. Then someone pointed me to Apache for Windows. I can be very stubborn! I finally get it. We get the source code for a fine web server running on a platform that we support. That'll work."/>
			<outline text="I see the holes in their implementation as opportunities. So what if it doesn't have a great GUI? I know lots of guys who do great GUIs because I come from the Mac. We sweat the pixels from where I come from."/>
			<outline text="I immediately wanted to be running it, so I moved all my apps off an idle machine  and put it up. Check it out. http://betty.userland.com/. Nothing fancy there. Yet! Maybe tomorrow. We're diggin hard."/>
			<outline text="I was right, we would meet up with our Unix brothers and sisters on Bill Gates's operating system."/>

			<outline text="Good morning and welcome back to DaveNet!"/>
			<outline text="It's been a long time, but I think it seems longer to me than it probably would to a reader. "/>
			<outline text="An example. A friend returned from a three-week trip from Bali, called me on Friday and was buzzing about the pieces I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/02/forgiveHer.html&quot;&gt;Karla Faye&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;Linux&quot;, weeks ago. "/>
			<outline text="She just read the pieces. She talks about them in the present tense. To me they're ancient history! I've been thru so much in the last few weeks, so little of it has to do with the old struggles. A sense of time emerges. Loops! Interesting."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I've learned a lot about management in the last few weeks. Some of these are old lessons. Here they are."/>
			<outline text="***Conflict"/>
			<outline text="You can't avoid conflict. When a group of people wants to work together, no matter how much, conflicts arise."/>
			<outline text="People make assumptions, invent theories, fall into patterns, make accusations, tell others to shut up, people stay silent and the patterns can turn into dysfunctional ruts. I'm not saying I don't do it too. I do. "/>
			<outline text="After the shipment of Frontier 5, I chose to go thru this. To challenge the assumptions, to confront the problems, to renegotiate our deal with the people we work with. It was time to do it. A lot of energy gets released when you ship a new version of a software product. All the questions that had turned into ruts came up, and this time I didn't run away."/>
			<outline text="I asked direct questions. Are we a community, and if so, what does the community do? Do we have developers, and if so, what is their commitment to their users? What level of professionalism do we aspire to? What is UserLand's responsibility? Our developers want independence, so do we. "/>
			<outline text="I think we did really well. We decided we are a community and we have developers. I think it's clear now, after lots of heated email, much of it public, that we can work with other people who are gathered around our software. We value professionalism, and keep a respectful distance between us so we can work together more effectively."/>
			<outline text="People are working much better, from my perspective; I hope from theirs too. It's an old lesson, if you want to plant a gorgeous garden, you have be willing to dig out the weeds."/>
			<outline text="***Free software"/>
			<outline text="In a different world, there's a lot of energy gathered around free software, with the Linux operating system at its center. I get a few messages from the energy. These people are mostly young. They've been left out of the world that Microsoft carved out thru competition with Apple, Novell, Sun, Oracle, Netscape, IBM, etc. "/>
			<outline text="Perhaps they don't see a way to win by following the economic structures of previous generations. I think this is a failure on my generation's part. Can we afford to include the entrepreneurial independence of the generation that's now coming of age? If I were in my early 20s now, I probably would be part of this group of people. "/>
			<outline text="But I'm not in my 20s. I have a lot invested in the idea of customers who pay money for software and programmers who get paid to develop it. I'm being pulled firmly further into commercial software. The number one feature request of my users is that we start charging money for our software so they can feel comfortable building careers on it. "/>
			<outline text="I'm being pulled. I want to build a team of business development, sales, marketing and support people for my users. The users want it and they deserve it. Same with our developers. And our investors."/>
			<outline text="So, in my world it's time to go commercial."/>
			<outline text="Now back to the other world..."/>
			<outline text="What if you're young and the only role the world offers you is to take a job working on someone else's software? Do you have to be a Microsoft developer to make software? What do you work on in your spare time? These are the questions they raise for me."/>
			<outline text="Creativity is something to nurture and encourage and channel, and there's not enough of that in the economics of the current commercial software industry. So they invent a world without the old rules. I think we forced them to do this. "/>
			<outline text="Somewhere in this cloud of energy there is a young version of Dan Bricklin or Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, I'm sure of it. They have what it takes to rock our world. Maybe not in 1998, but in a few years. "/>
			<outline text="It's better to look into it now."/>
			<outline text="***Learning Systems"/>
			<outline text="Switching gears..."/>
			<outline text="I've got an idea of nirvana in learning systems, now we just have to flesh it out and start implementing."/>
			<outline text="The ideal is a web page that's a simple form, like the ones you see on Infoseek or Excite or Alta Vista. Type in a phrase, get a list of pages."/>
			<outline text="The key is a smart human-authored index on the other side. Like Yahoo, but restricted to a single subject. It knows how to search its own database, and provide the most relevant information first."/>
			<outline text="Some sites, like www.scripting.com, have so much information to offer that a list of all the pages is overwhelming. People can't easily find the information they need. "/>

			<outline text="Relational databases will not go away, but a new kind of database will take root. Object databases, ones that can manage heterogeneous, non-tabular information. In other words, XML is more general than the relational form. Relational databases will only be able to manage a subset of XML."/>
			<outline text="My company makes an object database. It's at the core of Frontier. There are others, but we think we have the best one.

			<outline text="With HTML and print technologies, the trip was one-way. You couldn't suck back content that had been rendered and start managing it. Lots of people have tried to do this, whole industries have been built around the idea of moving content from the unmanaged world to management.

As long as the content is specified in XML, today's rendering technique doesn't limit us from going forward with new rendering techniques in the future."/>
			<outline text="As I think about new approaches to content management in view of the development of XML, I keep circling around this idea, and realized that it was time for a new way of thinking. The two-way nature of XML is the reason why."/>

			<outline text="Today I'm writing this DaveNet piece with WordPad. It's an interesting experiment. Ever since I changed my primary platform to Windows it's been an adventure. I had already found the best writing tool for me on the Mac, it was MORE. Now I'm a wanderer. "/>
			<outline text="I'm more flexible. WordPad is a nice piece of software. I can hear the people at Microsoft ducking, waiting for me to say, but... But it's fine. It does the job. I'm writing. It's receiving. All is cool. It sure is a heck of a lot nicer than SimpleText. And of course, since it's 1998, not 1984, it should be."/>
			<outline text="***Can Java defy gravity?"/>
			<outline text="Galileo figured it out, why can't we? Only structures stay up (for a while). If it's built on hype, gravity rules, and what goes up must come down. Hype always gives in to substance. Java can't defy this rule, nothing can. "/>
			<outline text="Last April, Sun announced an aggressive plan to put a user interface on Java. Now, ten months later, they're beginning to deliver. That's an incredible accomplishment. It takes a long time to develop good user interface toolkits. They're working quickly, it seems, from my point of view."/>
			<outline text="Last year, the industry had  trouble distinguishing Java's promises from delivery. It was given extra credit, it was assumed it could zoom thru all the problems that previous platforms took years to move thru. We should have been able to neutralize the promises of Sun officials by asking tough questions and demanding straight answers. "/>
			<outline text="Instead the headlines captured the euphoria, Java Defies Gravity! every headline seemed to say. Netscape would do a browser entirely in Java. One version of the source could would run anywhere. That was their answer to Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="All of the promises of Java are evaporating now. It will take many years to mature all the APIs and interfaces. It's going to be a simple world for a long time. That's the reality of Java. It can't defy gravity."/>
			<outline text="That doesn't mean it can't take its place among other software that does things it can't do. A negotiation is taking place. Java came in like a bull in a china shop. If they get pragmatic, Sun can develop a business around Java. But they may be the last to see that the bubble is bursting. "/>
			<outline text="***Is Push the next big thing?"/>
			<outline text="It never was. It was so transparent. If you just thought it thru, you realized push was just email. Instead of creating new protocols, CDF, DRP and OSD, push could have built on SMTP and POP. It would have been a no-brainer, it would have bought them so much compatibility, and since Push was so closely linked to Java, it could have given Java a great email client and server, which it still lacks."/>
			<outline text="I remember a panel presentation at InternetWorld last March. Microsoft's Brad Chase on stage, and representatives of Backweb, Pointcast, and other companies camped out in the then-hot push market. It was positioning and nothing more. We now know how it turned out. The protocol they were promoting didn't happen, the users didn't want it, and the hotness of the companies on the stage (and off) evaporated quickly."/>
			<outline text="***XML XML XML"/>
			<outline text="It's important to take another look at Push because XML is getting the same rap. If Push is a fad-gone-by, can XML be far behind?"/>
			<outline text="Now I'm hyping XML because I believe it won't go that way. I promise if I'm on a stage with Microsoft it won't be on the same terms that Backweb and Pointcast stood up with them. Right now I'm a believer in XML because I believe it empowers everyone, not just Microsoft. If I think it's going in a different direction, I will tell you."/>
			<outline text="Right now I'm still a believer."/>
			<outline text="***COM"/>
			<outline text="There's a technical revolution hidden inside Windows, a far-reaching architecture, called COM. Unlike other buzzwords, COM has substance, a long history, but has suffered from Microsoft's mishandling of the marketing job, and the industry's cynicism about Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="Even so, COM *is* Windows. It's the glue that connects Windows together, apps and .asps, system software and tools. It's Microsoft's biggest strength, and therefore it's the thing they need to defend the most. COM is their runtime, and runtime is a big thing with Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="***RPC over HTTP via XML"/>
			<outline text="OK, now look at this situation with different colored glasses. The Internet is a platform. A platform is made up of tools and runtimes. Internet tools run on all kinds of operating systems, as do the runtimes. The beauty of the net is its simplicity, its ubiquity and its lack of a controlling vendor. "/>
			<outline text="TCP is the runtime environment of the Internet. It's deeply competitive with Microsoft, and it's larger than Microsoft. The stronger TCP is, the more outside of Microsoft's control it is, the more powerful everyone else will be."/>
			<outline text="The Unix people have been in a struggle with everyone else over who owns the Internet. I've been writing about this for a long time. It would be great if they could let go of the struggle and realize that the Internet is owned by the universe, no single operating system or flavor of operating system can contain it."/>
			<outline text="This is important because there is another layer coming on the Internet, a very simple one, that can build on COM, on Windows and elsewhere, and provide a flat playing field for everyone."/>
			<outline text="It's RPC over HTTP via XML. I believe it's the next protocol for runtimes. We'll be posting more notes on this on Scripting News over the next few weeks. Please, if you care about the independence of the Internet, tune in. Thanks!"/>

			<outline text="I've been defining more acronymns lately than usual! People say I missed defining RPC, but that's not true. I wrote a whole piece about RPC in May 1996, almost two years ago:"/>

			<outline text="&quot;When I was a computer science grad student, in the late 1970s, we were ga-ga about an idea called Remote Procedure Calls or RPC. An application is distributed across a network, with pieces residing on different servers, presumably with different access privileges, allowing multiple authors to work on the same piece of software. RPC allows parts to be updated at will; and hopefully because of agreed-to interfaces, everything would keep working.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="***What's in the way? "/>
			<outline text="Well, it's a dangerous game for the Unix guys. If CORBA is wired up to a simple XML interface, then anyone can easily connect to CORBA apps from anywhere, without adopting any specific religion, without accepting Sun/Oracle/IBM's leadership."/>
			<outline text="It's also a dangerous game for Microsoft. If common interfaces allow a network manager to switch out a Windows NT server with a Linux or Rhapsody server they could lose. They'd have to keep their products competitive in a larger world."/>
			<outline text="And such a process is also easily victimized by hucksters, people who want to do IPOs based on leadership in this area. "/>
			<outline text="So fear and greed, the usual things, are in the way."/>
			<outline text="***Power of the users"/>
			<outline text="But it's the right way to go for everyone else because it puts the power where it belongs, in the market. As a user and a small software developer it's definitely in my interest to see the RPC interfaces flattened out. The more this happens, the more slots I can plug my software into, the more valuable it becomes."/>
			<outline text="So could the software industry do a standard RPC interface, for the right reasons, because it empowers users? Or will it be a competitive battleground? "/>
			<outline text="Here's a chance for the users to take control. A point of vulnerability in the collective lock the giants have on the users. A window is open now. It won't be open forever."/>
			<outline text="If the interfaces are flattened out, they'll never break, because no vendor will have the power to break them. Right now Microsoft appears to be interested in a standard. It's a chance to get everything in synch, and to let the company with the best, highest-performance software win. (And of course the best, highest-performance marketing and support machine.)"/>

			<outline text="Gulp! It's a shocking but fair question. I have no idea. No, I don't think it can."/>
			<outline text="I took that problem to bed with me last night, and this morning I have the answer."/>
			<outline text="It doesn't matter. The server-side dynamic page rendering isn't as important as client-side rendering because now the server can be distributed. "/>
			<outline text="That must sound like a puzzling statement. But it's a puzzling new situation. "/>
			<outline text="Here's the logic."/>
			<outline text="***New logic"/>
			<outline text="Frontier is now a web server. What does that mean? "/>
			<outline text="By definition, that means that web browsers can now talk directly to us. We've had some of that working before thru a method called protocol handlers, but they weren't implemented well on the Mac, so we never were able to build features in Frontier behind it ."/>
			<outline text="But there's no problem, on Mac or Windows, with a web browser talking to a web server. That's what they were designed to do! If they don't do that well, then they can't claim to be a browser."/>
			<outline text="***Bonk!"/>
			<outline text="So, why would anyone care about this, other than people who geek around inside servers? "/>
			<outline text="Because it all can work on a client or content development machine. The browser can talk directly to us. That means we can build friendly user interfaces on data that's stored in our object database; all the websites, system scripts, everything. "/>
			<outline text="And how does the information flow into the database? Thru the web server, using XML-based RPC, whatever format turns out to be the standard, the more the merrier."/>
			<outline text="Now we can think of client-side and server-side being exactly the same thing. Content that lives well in either place. Data moves around via XML RPC. Smart sandboxes. Powerful rendering anywhere. "/>
			<outline text="I've been writing about this for years. Now we're there."/>
			<outline text="I'm so excited!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I know this is over almost everybody's head. But we crossed a major milestone and I want people who grok the technology to understand where we are. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: DHTML is the next area we dig into."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Of course we still do powerful and elegant statically rendered websites."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/14/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="A few quick notes before I head out of town for the Seybold show in New York next week."/>
			<outline text="***O'Reilly's support"/>
			<outline text="Last Tuesday, O'Reilly Associates shipped &quot;Frontier: The Definitive Guide,&quot; written by Matt Neuburg, a key contributor in the Frontier community. "/>
			<outline text="I first met Matt electronically on the support mailing lists for Frontier a couple of years ago. He just showed up one day, answering questions for newbies and oldbies that showed that he had really studied the subject. I sent him a private email thanking him for his interest, and complimented him on his ability to teach and explain. He said he was jealous of Dan Shafer, who had written the first User's Guide for Frontier. &quot;I wanted to do it!&quot; Matt said. He also said that he believed he was the only person who could explain Frontier as it should be described."/>
			<outline text="I really appreciate that kind of confidence! Matt wrote two tutorials, one on website management and another on scripting. Both were successful, lots of people learned Frontier for the first time thru Matt's writing. Then, last March, I met with Tim O'Reilly to talk about a Frontier book. I recommended Matt as the author of the O'Reilly book. They hired him, and this week, after a lot of work, back and forth, and much struggling on both sides, the book shipped."/>
			<outline text="I read half of the book on two plane flights on Wednesday. For me it was a stirring experience. The words describe something I had written ten years ago, documenting design decisions that are still running. For me these ideas were buried in the past, but Matt brought them into the present for me. What a gift! I learned a lot about my own work. I think every software designer and developer deserves this experience."/>
			<outline text="Matt's book also highlights the problems in the process caused by the speed of development that's made possible by the web. We ship new versions on a weekly basis. We can do this because the pipe is shorter these days. We go from idea to implementation to deployment in weeks now, where it used to take months or years to accomplish the same results."/>
			<outline text="So the book isn't perfect because our process isn't perfect. It's Mac-specific and Frontier is cross-platform. It's about version 4.2.3; we're currently shipping 5.0.1. Even so, I recommend that every serious Frontier user get this book, even though it describes some features that have changed or were eliminated in the current version. Even Windows users will find a lot of relevant information that's available nowhere else. It belongs on every Frontier user's bookshelf. "/>
			<outline text="We're very lucky to have Matt on our side, explaining our work. We'll learn to do better, to make Frontier more immediately learnable, with Matt's help and O'Reilly's support."/>
			<outline text="http://www.ora.com/catalog/frontier/ "/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft's support"/>
			<outline text="This morning Frontier is the top item on Microsoft's Site Builder Network."/>
			<outline text="They said some very nice things about us."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is the platform vendor who has no fear, or at least no fear of us."/>
			<outline text="They continue to exceed all reasonable expectations of support from a platform vendor. We really like working with Microsoft. We don't expect this much support. What a pleasure to get it anyway! A lot of people say Microsoft can't work for win-wins, but my experience has been totally the opposite. You can quote me on that. It's the truth."/>
			<outline text="We've now been working with Microsoft for less than five months. In this period we've done more win-win deals with them than in ten years of struggling with Apple. There's no doubt that Microsoft has opened the door for us. People who paint them as an evil empire are over-simplifying. Have they ever tried to work with Microsoft? Can you work with another company when you question their integrity? I think not."/>
			<outline text="I accept Microsoft. They're here to stay. That doesn't mean that I'm afraid of competing with them. I think the world is more subtle, it's not just technology that counts. Right now we have technology that they don't have. I expect them to let their users and developers know we're here. I also expect them to study what we do, and it wouldn't surprise me if they edge into our functionality. "/>
			<outline text="But they can't become us because they are Microsoft, and we are not. As I watch Netscape struggle with their future, based on the expectation that Microsoft will match or exceed their functionality, I think they miss an important point. A lot of people, especially web developers and publishers, don't see themselves as part of Microsoft's world, even if they use or develop Windows systems. A thread of independence that's precious. It's central to my purpose, and it was and is central to Netscape's."/>
			<outline text="Some say it's time to throw in the towel. Either you're Microsoft or you're dead, they say. That's too simple. It's a big world. It may appear to revolve around Microsoft but it doesn't. It revolves around users, the people with the money. More and more, systems are replaceable. The interfaces are less and less proprietary. Lock in goes out. "/>
			<outline text="We can do what Microsoft does, and of course they can do what we do. But there's a difference, and in that difference is the hope for the future. It really is in the user's hands. If they want diversity they can have it. But they have to get their act together to guarantee it."/>
			<outline text="To me, what counts is the depth and accessibility of the software, its elegance as a solution to problems that people have. Your track record makes a difference. Do you upgrade relevantly? Do you move where the users want you to move?"/>
			<outline text="Software, like a website, is about community. It's a conversation. It's easier to stay with what you know. Believe this -- Microsoft is taking a chance by promoting our software to their users and developers. Many people believed they would never do this. Take a look. Think again. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.microsoft.com/sitebuilder/ "/>
			<outline text="***Seybold's support"/>
			<outline text="So I'm off to New York on Tuesday morning. I'll be speaking on the XML keynote, commercial concerns aside, I'll say what I have to say, and I didn't have to pay for the right to do it. Integrity will happen. I hope to learn a lot!"/>
			<outline text="And, as has become a tradition, I will do an evening solo session on Wednesday night. This time I'll demo Frontier for Windows. It'll be interesting because past Seybolds have been pretty much Mac-only. I want to show how Windows makes an excellent web content management environment. "/>
			<outline text="The evening session is free and open to the public. "/>
			<outline text="If you're in New York on Wednesday evening, I hope you come. "/>
			<outline text="Wednesday, March 18, Javits Center, 7:30PM, look for signs for DaveNet. "/>
			<outline text="It's free and open to the public. Bring your questions!"/>

			<outline text="This is so weird."/>
			<outline text="Eighteen years ago I had root canal work. I remember it being excruciating. The work went on and on, but finally it was over. I forgot it. Yes, I had two silver teeth. But they barely got one tenth of one percent of my consciousness."/>
			<outline text="Until last night!"/>
			<outline text="I was eating pizza with a friend, getting up to get another slice, when I felt this foreign substance in my mouth. Hmmm. At first I thought it might be something impure about the pizza. I took the impurity out of my mouth. It looks like a tooth! Oooops. A piece of my mouth was in my hand."/>
			<outline text="I wondered why it didn't hurt. But this morning it does. Quite a bit..."/>
			<outline text="***The Dog Ate My Homework"/>
			<outline text="I had planned a trip to NY to speak at Seybold, to meet with friends and explore new business opporunities. The trip is cancelled. My apologies to the people who were coming to the DaveNet Live session tomorrow night. It won't happen. "/>
			<outline text="***What I would have said"/>
			<outline text="XML XML XML. It doesn't quite have the ring of Marcia Marcia Marcia or Java Java Java, but like Marcia and Java, XML does have substance; but there's a lot of extra hype and confusion. "/>
			<outline text="XML is substantial, even more so, in my opinion, than Java. But the airshows get in the way. The hype balloons. Isn't this easy? they say. OK. But why?"/>
			<outline text="The substance of XML is about two things, rendering-independence of content and as a format for inter-network plumbing. I'll also talk more about the hype."/>
			<outline text="***Scalable content"/>
			<outline text="First, XML has a strong place as a rendering-independent way of specifying structured information. This is a good idea. It's scalable content. Stuff that's specified in XML can evolve to the next rendering method. If all the multimedia CD-ROMs of the early 90s had been written in XML (it didn't exist then) they could have been re-rendered for the web, and whatever comes after the web."/>
			<outline text="This is the SGML pitch. When people say that XML is like SGML, this is what they mean. "/>
			<outline text="It's a real benefit, not hype. Scalable content is especially important for the Seybold crowd, people and companies who invest big bucks in content. If you want that investment to pay off, no matter what comes down the road, it pays to systematize the development and management of the content. "/>
			<outline text="My good friend Marc Canter is the constant evangelist of scalable content. He made me aware of the concept, and continues to teach me about it. Marc is an idealist, but listen to him, he's learned the hard way, and he practices what he preaches."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/98/03/stories/marquis.html "/>
			<outline text="If you're in the content business, at any level, in any way, and you're not thinking about scalable content, read Marc's piece, or you'll get a big I Told You So in a couple of years. "/>
			<outline text="***Plumbing"/>
			<outline text="I'm a systems guy. I love scalable content, but I live for plumbing. "/>
			<outline text="My vision is hundreds of thousands of servers running compatible software, delivering beautiful HTML and DHTML pages over HTTP, with great workflow systems running behind the server, allowing creative people of all flavors to work together effortlessly, using the tools they like and understand, and have it all assembled into a constantly-changing presence."/>
			<outline text="I want the authors to feel like they're in touch with their audience, but to have a clear line between authorship and readership. I want everyone who creates value to make money. I want to compete and cooperate with other companies who deliver pieces of this puzzle."/>
			<outline text="To make that vision real, we need good plumbing. We need to be able to connect the authoring systems with the content management systems and the web servers. There are already many plumbing systems, but we could use a new one that supersets and simplifies all the existing protocols. "/>
			<outline text="The promise of XML as a plumbing level is that now, in 1998, we can sort out the differences, allow a new kind of server to be created, and get ready for the next level of growth in net-based content."/>
			<outline text="The beauty of XML is that the code is compatible even if it's written in Java, Tcl, Perl, Visual Basic, C++, JavaScript, AppleScript, Pascal or COBOL. And it can happen independently of the companies and people who create each of these languages. No need to wait for the rumbling egos to agree to open their systems. They're already open enough."/>
			<outline text="***Hype"/>
			<outline text="It's happening, but not on the podiums of the new XML circuit. What's happening on the podiums? Posturing and positioning. The same kind of stuff that brought us Push last year. The hype is superficial. If it gives you comfort, or makes you rich, go for it."/>
			<outline text="But in the end the hype will subside, as it did with Push, and the companies that win will be the ones with deep and efficient workflow systems and substantial content tools that creative people like to use."/>
			<outline text="***Marimba"/>
			<outline text="Please pay attention to who's *not* on the XML hype circuit. "/>
			<outline text="I find it fascinating and encouraging that Marimba, the leader of the Push push is busy creating systems and selling software, and not latching their presence to the XML hype parade. That's cool! "/>
			<outline text="I lost a few friends when I went anti-Push in early 1997. But I think I have been vindicated. The web is alive and well. HTML is still the way of the world, and it will be in the future too. "/>
			<outline text="But Push has a place. If we had been more realistic about it in 1997, we wouldn't feel burned by it now. Let's learn from the experience. Don't go ga-ga over the XML promises. Let's wait for delivery. It's more interesting."/>
			<outline text="I'd like to offer my thanks and extend an olive branch to Marimba. They will continue to play an important role in the new plumbing system of the net. Our software will be compatible. We'll work together, that's the beauty of standards, that's what's beautiful about XML."/>
			<outline text="Life sure is funny!"/>
			<outline text="***Tools"/>
			<outline text="I have a message for three companies, Adobe, NetObjects and Macromedia, and other vendors of content tools. "/>
			<outline text="WebDAV. It's another XML-based standard, being developed thru the IETF, largely by Microsoft, that defines how work flows thru content management systems."/>
			<outline text="It's got Big Mo, in my opinion. It solves the problem. Proprietary workgroup software will fade as WebDAV gains traction. Open systems are the way of the future. The big money is going that way. "/>
			<outline text="Tools makers like Adobe, NetObjects and Macromedia can connect to servers in an open way. WebDAV is the way."/>
			<outline text="***Client-server? Giant-server!"/>
			<outline text="Now I get wistful."/>
			<outline text="In my breast beats the heart of two Jewish men, Rube Goldberg and Albert Einstein. I love cobbled-together systems that magically work and I'm seeking a unified theory that allows systems to connect effortlessly."/>
			<outline text="I live with reality and I reach for nirvana. That's me! The plumbing is interesting to me, just because it's plumbing. Connections. Client-server is the way of the past. Servers everywhere. Huge virtual web servers. Giant distributed servers! Workflow. That's the way of the future."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/23/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Today I have a technical tale to tell."/>
			<outline text="***Once upon a time"/>
			<outline text="Early in the 90s, Apple had a good idea called the Open Scripting Architecture."/>
			<outline text="It was a good idea for two reasons. First, it said that scripting would play a large role as the Mac OS went forward. And second, it said that script writers could have a choice of syntax. "/>
			<outline text="History has proved them right, on both counts. The Internet is built around scripting. And choice of syntax is an even bigger issue today than it was in the early 90s."/>
			<outline text="***Plaform-independent OSA"/>
			<outline text="But Apple's OSA didn't catch on because it's very much a Mac thing. It built on the Apple Event Manager and the Component Manager. I think this stuff became part of OpenDoc, and was lost when OpenDoc was cancelled. I'm not sure. But one thing's for sure, if these protocols have been implemented elsewhere, they are not popular outside the Mac."/>
			<outline text="If OSA had achieved its potential, it would have allowed languages such as Python, Rexx, Perl, Java, JavaScript, Tcl and AppleScript to become plug-ins for applications such as Oracle, PhotoShop, Visual Interdev, Apache, Director, and basically everything."/>
			<outline text="Therefore, just as the push to do RPC over HTTP via XML has the potential of getting COM, CORBA and Apple Events to talk to each other, an open cross-platform scripting architecture holds the promise of bringing together cultures from every nook and cranny of the software business, from mainframes to handhelds, from graphics people to the folks who keep the Hubble telescope humming."/>
			<outline text="Imagine writing a PhotoShop plugin in JavaScript or Python."/>
			<outline text="I think the benefits are obvious."/>
			<outline text="***Perl &amp; donuts"/>
			<outline text="I want Perl to run in Frontier!"/>
			<outline text="I want it the same way Homer Simpson wants donuts."/>
			<outline text="My eyes roll to the back of my head. "/>
			<outline text="My tongue wags out of my mouth. "/>
			<outline text="I lose consciousness for a moment. "/>
			<outline text="Perl. Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="***Perl &amp; XML"/>
			<outline text="Now the Perl guys, our friends at O'Reilly, are talking about making Perl the ideal scripting language for XML. I support that, because I want XML to be everywhere, and Perl already is in a lot of places. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/10961.html "/>
			<outline text="But I wonder if there isn't some way they can leverage our ground-breaking work in XML databases, and get the Perl community up the hill as soon as possible, as strongly as possible, instead of waiting for them to reinvent what we already have working."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/ "/>
			<outline text="We're in a unique position because we already have a database that's well-suited for storing XML structures, and it's integrated with our scripting environment and tool and verb set and multi-threaded runtime. "/>
			<outline text="There's one problem that could neatly be solved by an open OSA. Our environment only runs our own language on Windows, and Apple OSA languages (a very small set, mostly Frontier and AppleScript) on the Mac. We want to offer a choice of syntaxes everywhere."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has a scripting architecture called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/inetsdk/help/compdev/scripting/scripting.htm&quot;&gt;ActiveX Scripting&lt;/a&gt;. It gets us a lot of languages, JavaScript, VB Script, Perl. But it doesn't work on the Mac. Further, the Perl culture is centered in Unix, a world where they don't wire up (necessarily) to Microsoft sponsored APIs (an understatement)."/>
			<outline text="The answer is one I think the Perl guys can support. Let's get together a group of the best designers and developers of scripting languages and environments and work out a common protocol that works on and across all popular OSes (HTTP based?) that allows script interpreters to hook into all flavors of tools and runtimes."/>
			<outline text="Our motive should be clear -- we want all the popular languages to run in our world, and we want to do as little work as possible. In return for not having to do a lot of work, we're willing to invest in an open standard, so our software can be replaced by others who wish to compete with us."/>
			<outline text="I think the answer is an open cross-platform scripting architecture."/>
			<outline text="What do you think?"/>
			<outline text="***Fastpace"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/2/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="I've been caught in a whirlwind. Things have been moving fast. Finally I'm getting a chance to catch my breath and write a little. "/>
			<outline text="I got an interesting email a few days ago from a regular Scripting News reader saying that he didn't understand what I've been talking about or what I've been pointing to ever since I got on the XML parade. "/>
			<outline text="I will try to make it simpler, and that'll happen soon. I promise."/>
			<outline text="***Reading Shakespeare"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime I've been reading the specs along with my confused correspondent."/>
			<outline text="It's like reading Shakespeare. I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, in school, and they made us read Shakespeare, I had no idea what they were talking about. I was raised in New York, in the mid-20th century. Shakespeare wrote in England in the mid-17th century. A lot changed in between including the language we use. It was called English then too. But it was a very different language from the one I speak."/>
			<outline text="Imagine Shakespeare trying to read the specs on the W3C site. He was a smart guy. What would he think? Would he rush out and get XML for Dummies as soon as he saw what was on those sites?"/>
			<outline text="Privately I've been evangelizing developers on putting a simple XML parser and HTTP server into their apps, alongside their COM and Apple Events interfaces. HTTP is simple enough, most developers have experimented at least a little in TCP programming. But when I ask the typical developer to think about writing an XML parser (I'm thinking of someone who does an HTML tool or a graphics app) mostly the response is &quot;What's an XML parser?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Uh huh. We have a long way to go. And XML is a moving target. And some of it is being designed for relational databases when we already have object databases that can represent XML data in (close to) their natural form without forcing contortions to make them fit the relational view."/>
			<outline text="***Standards"/>
			<outline text="I think the standards process is weak. It gives an extrordinary voice to the large companies, and history has shown that they rarely are hotbeds of innovation, nor are they willing to take real risks on new technology, nor do they really want to move quickly. A confounding maze of computer science is the result, when (I believe) the only thing the market will actually consume is simplicity."/>
			<outline text="The standards process supports the kind of stagnation we've seen between Netscape and MSIE. Look at how quickly the products got into lockstep and look at the dearth of new ideas in browsers. Do we want to continue to support that process? Both companies are talking to C and Java developers. Who is going to provide the next level of power for people who understand HTML?"/>
			<outline text="***Feverish pace?"/>
			<outline text="Neither Microsoft or Netscape has put vector graphics into the browser. Why not? Such an obvious idea. How did the standards bodies miss that? In the old days, when Excel and Lotus were facing off, or Word and WordPerfect, the pace of innovation was higher, belying the idea that &quot;Internet time&quot; is faster than old times. "/>
			<outline text="Sure we're all moving at a feverish pace, but how much real progress are we making? Are we building on each other's work? Two weeks ago when I proposed that we work with Perl developers to leverage our work in XML databases, the most popular answer was &quot;We'll crush you because we're bigger.&quot; Uck. Been there done that. You crush yourself, not me. I keep moving."/>
			<outline text="I think (I hope) we're just in a breather period between explosions. The web made a big difference. Can the next growth incubator happen without a major delay? We'll see, sooooon, I think."/>
			<outline text="That's what I'm thinking about right now. I want to keep it simple. I want to break out from behind HTML-imposed barriers, but I don't want to give up the low-tech understandability of HTML."/>

			<outline text="Netscape's purpose is to serve the web developer community. They did that for a few months at the end of 1994, the beginning of 1995, and then, ever since, they've been lost. Contrary to popular belief it was a self-inflicted slide, not caused by the fierce competition with Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="***Here's what went wrong"/>
			<outline text="Imagine you're a web developer. "/>
			<outline text="You like blockquote, table, hr, etc. They're so easy, even if they're limited (mostly *because* they're limited). You're cruising along. Loving what you're doing. "/>
			<outline text="Then one day the company that started it all says &quot;Java Java Java&quot;. It's neat! OK. You go out and get a Java book. Huh? What's this? But everyone's so excited. There must be something wrong with me. "/>
			<outline text="***Those nutty VCs"/>
			<outline text="Three years later, the Java hype is over. VCs won't touch it, which is ironic because people developing in Java are finally starting to ship commercial quality results. Oh those nutty VCs. "/>
			<outline text="A contrarian VC would clean up, merge a bunch of Java teams into one company and market their products. Whatever floats to the top is the killer app. "/>
			<outline text="Java is a lot like the Newton or Palm Pilot. It takes a few years for new environments to gestate. Patience pays. It's a long-term bet. But Java was never a good bet for Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="***Back to the story"/>
			<outline text="Like Candide lost in the software industry, Netscape looks for a new home. Java didn't work for them. So instead of talking to their only natural constituency, they say C++ C++ C++! Our bacon will be saved by the creativity of thousands of C++ programmers. But these people don't make websites. Oooops."/>
			<outline text="I've been sending private emails to Marc Andreessen for the last week. &quot;Marc, get a clue!&quot; I say. He says I have to talk to the new benevolent dictator in charge of the Navigator software, as if I have a feature request or want to start programming in C++ again. "/>
			<outline text="Hmmm."/>
			<outline text="***Free source"/>
			<outline text="Based on my experience, confirmed by the informal survey I ran over the weekend, very few people place supreme value on free source code. "/>
			<outline text="http://betty.userland.com/testing/softwareSurvey/default.wsf "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Features you can't get anywhere else&quot; was by far the number one choice. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Free source code available&quot; was way down the list. Why? My guess: most people have no use for free source code, even if they have the skills. People are busy busy busy. They want to double-click and get going."/>
			<outline text="Maybe this piece will inspire some web developers with C++ skills to take a leadership position in the new free-source world of Navigator, and maybe they'll prove me wrong. Nothing would please me more."/>
			<outline text="***It's a conversation"/>
			<outline text="My friend Doc Searls says that marketing is a conversation. He's so right. It's a two way thing. So many people think marketing is a message, I talk, you listen, but that's how you lose your way."/>
			<outline text="If marketing is a conversation then a company is a fireplace. We sit down and talk. If you talk over my head (Java) or say stupid things (Java), no matter how nice you look, or what other people say about you, eventually I'll look for a more interesting conversation elsewhere."/>
			<outline text="I think most web developers, like most Mac users, are inherently not part of the Microsoft conversation. It was never about feature parity, just as in the Mac market it was never about market share or licensing. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is big and self-contained. That's just who they are. Media businesses are diverse and cacaphonous. Sure, some web developers sing the Microsoft song. But there are plenty of smart web people who see the value in independence from Microsoft, almost at a genetic, self-defining level."/>
			<outline text="If Netscape was a really beautiful fireplace for web developers, one built on respect, and if they had hired and trusted people who loved the new medium, there would have been nothing Microsoft could have done to displace them. "/>
			<outline text="The independence of the web developer community is what Netscape was founded on. It's a dramatic tragedy that the owners of the company never connected with this simple idea."/>
			<outline text="***A watershed"/>
			<outline text="I feel like we're at a watershed, about to disconnect from Netscape. They're going in a different direction, we wish them luck in their journey, but don't expect to take the trip with them. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/13/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It's been a major Monday morning in the XML and graphics world."/>
			<outline text="First, early this morning, a group led by Netscape, Sun and Hewlett-Packard announced that they would work on an Internet standard called Simple Workflow Access Protocol, or SWAP."/>
			<outline text="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980413/ca_netscap_1.html "/>
			<outline text="According to the press release, SWAP will build on HTTP. No specification was released, nor was there official word on when the group would meet."/>
			<outline text="A charter for this group appeared in early April on a Netscape website. From the charter it appears that SWAP will go thru IETF, not W3C."/>
			<outline text="This protocol probably overlaps in functionality with the RPC-over-HTML format we've been developing at UserLand. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html "/>
			<outline text="However, if SWAP gains traction, we will implement it too, of course."/>
			<outline text="***Vector graphics in XML"/>
			<outline text="Then, later in the morning, an announcement came from Adobe, Netscape and IBM that they had submitted a specification for vector graphics that would enable net clients (e.g. Navigator and Notes) to display resizable images. "/>
			<outline text="The new format is called Precision Graphics Markup Language or PGML."/>
			<outline text="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML-19980410.html "/>
			<outline text="***You can't hurry love"/>
			<outline text="I've wanted this for a long time! "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/06/LineToMoveTo.html "/>
			<outline text="***It's for designers and programmers"/>
			<outline text="If PGML is deployed widely, designers, people who use XPress, PageMaker, Illustrator or Freehand, will be able to give websites the look of a glossy magazine without compromising bandwidth. "/>
			<outline text="And programmers, people who work in C and Pascal, on Mac or Windows or Unix, will be able to create net functionality that looks and feels like an application running on personal computer desktops. "/>
			<outline text="Both groups of people will immediately understand the PGML format. It's simple if you have the right background, and a lot of people have the right background."/>
			<outline text="***It enhances XML"/>
			<outline text="Further, since PGML is a variant of XML, it will pull XML parsing technology thru applications, making it easier for those products to support other XML-based standards."/>

			<outline text="Good evening!"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I reported on Netscape's SWAP and Adobe's PGML."/>
			<outline text="Today there are important follow-ups to both stories."/>
			<outline text="***SWAP is a press release"/>
			<outline text="The behind the scenes SWAP story was told earlier today by Keith Swenson of Netscape in a posting to two public mail lists. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/98/04/stories/netscapeExplainsSwap.html "/>
			<outline text="SWAP is just getting started, there's no spec yet, no process, it's just an informal agreement between the companies to work together. "/>
			<outline text="I always wondered how press releases like this come together, and Swenson explains. It's fascinating reading. "/>
			<outline text="***Macromedia moves"/>
			<outline text="This morning Macromedia did something I asked them to do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/06/LineToMoveTo.html&quot;&gt;in June 1997&lt;/a&gt;, they released the specification for their Flash vector graphics format. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what I said last year: &quot;Flash is what we need. I have an idea! Let's not wait for Microsoft and Netscape. Let's ask Macromedia to hook the Flash editor up to web content tools, let's ask the tool vendors to work with Macromedia, and let's get on with it.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Now, we can finally get on with it! "/>
			<outline text="But did Macromedia wait too long to open up Flash?"/>
			<outline text="If they had acted earlier, things would be different, but Adobe has moved. "/>
			<outline text="***XMLizing Postscript"/>
			<outline text="PGML is the XMLization of Postscript, and there's a lot of power behind Postscript, and a lot of potential in XML. "/>
			<outline text="A lot more people know how to program Postscript than Flash, which until earlier today, was a closed format."/>
			<outline text="And don't miss the power of XML. If you've made an investment in handling XML in your software, you're already in good position to work with PGML. We still have a lot to learn about the format of Flash."/>
			<outline text="***Where's Flash now?"/>
			<outline text="So where is Flash at, right now, compared to PGML? There's a single tool for Flash, and no tools for PGML. There's a substantial base of content for Flash, and no content for PGML. "/>
			<outline text="But both Flash advantages will fade if products like Illustrator, Freehand, PageMaker, Fusion, Corel and XPress are converted to read and write PGML. "/>
			<outline text="A lot of the power is in the hands of tools developers."/>
			<outline text="***Runtimes"/>
			<outline text="Runtimes may also be a problem for Flash. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft announced that they were supporting Macromedia, so it's reasonable to assume that Flash support will be provided in a future version of Internet Explorer without requiring a plug-in. "/>
			<outline text="And of course since the Navigator source is public, anyone can add Flash support, but the old question arises, will Netscape ship it? Netscape is on the list of supporters for PGML, and may have already chosen sides."/>
			<outline text="***So, a survey"/>

			<outline text="This morning I'm working on some new user interface stuff."/>
			<outline text="It challenges a lot of my beliefs about where certain pieces of software reside."/>
			<outline text="Where do you think a web server belongs? Does it have to be on a machine that's far away from you, over a LAN or a phone line? "/>
			<outline text="In my own head, it's hard to get rid of the idea that it has to be far away, even though now I routinely write software that assumes that it's right here."/>
			<outline text="This is a road that every serious developer is going to go down. I'm sure of it. HTTP is too valuable a protocol to only use it to connect with far-away things."/>
			<outline text="***Personal web servers"/>
			<outline text="I used to think the idea of a personal web server was bogus. But I was experiencing a disconnect. I missed the idea that the web server could be used to connect with software running on the personal machine, that it wasn't necessary that anyone else be able to connect to it for the connection to have value."/>
			<outline text="If there's value in this idea, and I know there is, then the skills of personal computer software developers will come to drive the Internet as it runs the desktop. Couple this with the PGML and Flash announcements, both within the last 48 hours, and the power of user interface developers becomes even clearer."/>
			<outline text="So, I'm working on a new suite that takes advantage of this idea. It's a direct result of the work we've been doing with Betty. The predecessors of the new stuff are the surveys, web-based admin experiments. Of course it builds on the HTTP-RPC stuff I've been promoting so heavily. "/>

			<outline text="***Why I'm writing"/>
			<outline text="I just wanted to tell you that I always dreamed of having an audience that could watch while I work. Instead of shipping a finished piece of software, I wanted the process to be open, so people could see how the pieces fit together, leading to an end result that's a gestalt, an aha, a new idea. I've always liked to explore new territory, but it was a lonely place to be. Now it's not that way anymore! This takes some getting-used-to."/>
			<outline text="With the web, and powerful new tools, and after a year of having a full T1 line, and a beefy LAN, and a Windows product that people respect, all these things, give me the power and credibility to achieve the dream. "/>

			<outline text="***Kevin Lynch on Vector Graphics"/>
			<outline text="Hi Dave. The survey on Flash versus PGML is interesting, but I think it presents a conflict that isn't true or necessary."/>
			<outline text="A combination of binary and text formats (such as GIF or PNG binary formats and HTML or XML text) are used together on the web, chosen by designers according to what's most appropriate for their work. The same will be true for vector design -- both a compact binary standard and a larger text standard will be available."/>
			<outline text="Macromedia is contributing the open .swf vector format to the web, and we hope it will be widely used as the compact binary standard. Its proven performance and small size enable great designs to transmit quickly over 28.8 modems."/>
			<outline text="We also believe it's important to have a future text format for vectors. Macromedia is working to help define this and will be participating as standards working groups are formed. Such a format will be useful in allowing scripts to modify content and to exchange designs between tools. "/>
			<outline text="I also believe that designers will be interested in compressing this format to the binary form to get the smallest possible size on their web pages, just as everyone compresses GIFs today."/>
			<outline text="***Eric Hahn on HTTP servers"/>
			<outline text="From Eric Hahn, executive vice-president and chief technical officer at Netscape, in response to &quot;A Note to My Readers&quot;, 4/15/98, where I extol the virtues of HTTP as a protocol for talking to things that are close by, not just far away. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what Eric says:"/>
			<outline text="I've been thinking about the web server on the client idea for a while, too. I'm totally enamored with this approach for a few reasons: "/>
			<outline text="1) You can actually use XML/HTML to be the entire UI in a cross-platform way. It's pretty easy to write portable server-side code in this model. The local RPC round-trip time is very reasonable, so you don't pay a big penalty in responsiveness, especially on client OSes with preemptive multitasking (Unix, NT). And if you really need to implement some difficult UI construct or need to keep up with individual keystrokes, you can resort to Java or JavaScript, etc. "/>
			<outline text="2) The user experience is centralized in the browser (you get a uniform locator space w/ URLs, you get a common metaphor for navigation and bookmarking, etc). This has deep implications beyond UI - like the certificate infrastructure for implementing single sign-on, and the ability to use newer browser stuff like RDF across applications, not just the web. "/>
			<outline text="3) It works off-line since presumably the server's store can be managed on a local drive (ask all of the &quot;server-based xxx&quot; companies what they do for us poor laptop users on the airplane...) "/>
			<outline text="4) You can run the server in the cloud, if you want - but you don't have to. You can also leave your desktop turned on when you travel and log into the app remotely if you prefer. This might imply some replication/sync between servers, but that is exactly the place to do it (not at the UI-laden client where it is commonly done today). "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I think this is a very important software architecture. "/>
			<outline text="PS: It needs a name (&quot;client-client&quot;, &quot;cerver&quot;, ad nauseum) "/>
			<outline text="***Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="I've been really busy writing software this week, but I have a couple of pieces I want to do, and haven't had time to write them. So here's what I would say, very briefly."/>
			<outline text="First, congratulations to Apple for the second consecutive profitable quarter. I've been the first to say that one quarter of good results is easy to achieve especially after a few losing quarters. Sustained profitability for Apple is a good thing, not just for Apple shareholders, but for anyone with an investment in diversity in the software world. "/>
			<outline text="So many people dis the Mac, but we continue to invest in the platform because Mac users are like none other in the world and their creativity and support is very valuable to us."/>
			<outline text="Second, I want tell you that Frontier is ten years old this month. It's by far the longest software project I've ever worked on. What a trip!"/>

			<outline text="I've been doing more top-level thinking over the last few days wandering around open source and vector graphic standards and the RPC-over-HTTP stuff we've been working on and where it's going and who else is working here and who isn't."/>
			<outline text="The thoughts arrange themselves in bullet points! "/>
			<outline text="Real quick stuff. "/>
			<outline text="And it goes somewhere."/>
			<outline text="***Let's go!"/>
			<outline text="1. PGML is the opening of Postscript. Adobe turned it over to a standards body. If it weren't for the euphoria around XML, people would have noticed this! A previously controlled standard is now open. Adobe isn't the only one with Postscript tools and renderers. It's major letting-go of power."/>
			<outline text="2. On Scripting News today, one of the architects of DCOM, Bob Atkinson, talks in the present tense about Microsoft's plans to transport DCOM over HTTP. If you follow Microsoft I strongly suggest reading this piece."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/98/04/stories/bobAtkinsonOnHttpPost.html "/>
			<outline text="3. Eric Hahn, the CTO at Netscape, is also excited about this idea, as he said here last week, but he probably doesn't think in terms of XMLizing DCOM. "/>
			<outline text="4. What other XMLizations are coming? Is Apple working on the XMLization of the Apple Event Manager? I want them to."/>
			<outline text="5. In the meantime, the stocks of Internet content and commerce companies are soaring. Jeff Bezos at Amazon is nearly a billionaire. Money is everywhere. New technologies are showing up daily that create opportunities for even more billions. When will it end? Not this year it seems. In this festival of money, why is so much of the talk about giving it away? Curious!"/>
			<outline text="6. Technology moves on, quicker and quicker. What was once a deep proprietary advantage becomes an open standard. How will Adobe manage in a world where it doesn't control Postscript? Or do they have to worry? And what will it mean if Microsoft gives up control of DCOM? No one knows!"/>

			<outline text="To people who think that open source is a panacea, think again. I have a bunch of experience here, predating the current euphoria. A few bullet points follow."/>
			<outline text="Our SDK, first released in 1992, and often updated, was totally open source. Some parts of it gained traction, but most of it was ignored. We did the vast majority of the work on the toolkit, with paid employees. "/>
			<outline text="In January 1995 we released the source to MacBird Runtime, hoping to ignite a move towards real user interfaces on the web. Nothing happened. It was never ported, and no bug fixes were ever supplied."/>
			<outline text="In 1997, I looked on the web for base64 code that worked with handles, not files. Finding none, I adapted existing implementations and released the source. This one worked, sort of. It was ported to HyperCard. Has anyone else used the code? I don't know."/>
			<outline text="***Why didn't these things work?"/>
			<outline text="First, I have to tell you, I don't know why they didn't work. I can only guess."/>
			<outline text="I certainly was excited about the idea of releasing the source and having other people do the work for me. Did I underhype these source releases? I did the best I could with what I had at the time."/>
			<outline text="The Frontier community tends to group where we are active. So if I back off updating something, they focus their attention where we are working. I find this frustrating, but I think it's just human nature at work. "/>
			<outline text="We aren't updating MacBird (or DocServer or a bunch of other things) but no one is clamoring for the source for those things. We are actively updating Frontier and the website framework and workflow facilities, and every day I get an email or two saying that it would all work much better if I just gave them the source, implying that the people would know what to do with it, or would keep up their interest in the code after they got it."/>
			<outline text="I have mixed experiences with this. I have given away code, sometimes with good results, but really, most of the time the projects get started with some enthusiasm, and wither on the vine. I've learned that if I want something to take root, I have to make a financial commitment to that happening."/>
			<outline text="***Chuck's sig"/>
			<outline text="My friend Chuck Shotton uses a great signature on his email. He says &quot;Shut up and eat your vegetables!&quot; I can't be that direct, I wish I could, but I'd like to tell the people who want to replace my team, you haven't got a clue how hard it is to maintain a source code base like Frontier. If you want me to trust you, get started working on fixing the problems in the code we have released, and then we'll take a look at trusting you with our family jewels."/>
			<outline text="Further, having invested several million dollars in this source code base, why do you think I should give it to you? If you want to know how this feels to me, imagine a stranger arriving at your front door and demanding food and a warm bed. You let them in. Sure! You can sleep here. It would be stupid to think that it would all come out for the best. Love at first sight? Nahh. I prefer to be romanced."/>
			<outline text="No other creative or engineering art works this way. Art and money are closely related. Try sitting down with a group of artists and ask them what's on their mind. Very quickly the topic shifts to money. And it can be very hard to get them off that subject."/>
			<outline text="Think about art yourself. When you look at a piece of art does it cross your mind how much it's worth? If you meet someone who's an artist, do you ask how much money they make from their art? Be honest. Try some experiments. Tell people you're an artist. See how often the conversation turns to how much money you make. What about all the actors who are waiters and taxi drivers? Do you take them seriously before they &quot;make it&quot;? What does making it mean? What's it? Does money have anything to do with it?"/>
			<outline text="The open source message is all about money, by the way, paid versus unpaid programmers, and in that sense it diflects us from where the most good can be done. Open source is a tactic. It's a zig to the commercial industry's zag. It can gain a market presence. Good tactics. But it's not right in every situation, far from it, nor can you make the world revolve around free source. It certainly has a place. But in itself it is not the revolution. I'm sure of this."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape Netscape Netscape"/>
			<outline text="I think Netscape has not done a service to the software world, users and developers, by going so strong on open source. If they want to please their shareholders, it's going to be complex and potentially very political. Like O'Reilly, who ships a mixture of open and closed source, so must Netscape, or the shareholders will throw out current management and replace them with people who are focused on making money. You can be sure of one thing, shareholders are not going to pay for what's right, they pay for what provides a good return on investment."/>
			<outline text="The focus is on Netscape. They're going to have to do an unprecedented political balancing act as developers feed them new features and bug-fixes, expecting that open source means open access to Netscape's distribution. There are indications, no clear statements, that this is *not* the way it will work. There's no commitment on Netscape's part to ship the work you do, nor would it be reasonable for them to make that commitment. Sometimes it's easier and more cost-effective to do the work yourself than to evaluate all the possible (sometimes conflicting!) submitted implementations."/>
			<outline text="We go thru this all the time. Developers, paid or not, make mistakes, or see things thru a narrower perspective than you can support. You have to read the code carefully before giving it to your users. I've learned this the hard way. Software has to have goals. And if Navigator fragments into fifteen incompatible browsers, they play right into Microsoft's strength. MSIE will become the market share leader, and content will be coded for their browser, not the various flavors of Navigator."/>
			<outline text="Think it thru. Even if Netscape hasn't said how it will work, how *must* it work? Netscape has bitten off a huge political task. Do they have the mature wisdom and global perspective needed to pull it off? Even if they were King Solomon, could they do it?"/>
			<outline text="***Philosophers"/>
			<outline text="At age 42, I hear much of the philosophy of open source coming from people who are younger. It truly is a generational thing. I've said before, if I were in my early 20s I would probably be part of the open source thing, but I'm not in my early 20s, I'm in my early 40s."/>
			<outline text="As all middle-aged people seem to believe, I think the younger people have a lot to learn. I look at them and I see myself at their age. I'm sure some part of this is real, but most of it is projection. They aren't me, they are them. They're throwing out some of our lessons and beliefs. That's inevitable, and therefore good. "/>
			<outline text="My advantage is deep experience. Their advantage is lack of experience. I really mean that. When I was young we threw out the ways of mainframes and discovered the power of minis and then micros. The older folk sniffed. &quot;We did that years ago!&quot; they said. But the seeds of their demise were already in the ground and we were the sprouts. The people of my generation, the two Steves at Apple, Bill Gates at Microsoft, and others, really did kick the legs out from under IBM, Sperry, DEC, etc. We know how it turned out."/>
			<outline text="But Compaq and Lotus had Ben Rosen and Apple had Mike Markkula. They were the adult supervision, the teachers, they gave us the inside scoop on the opposition. They told us how the world worked, and we worked around that. They were our surrogate fathers, caring about our success, enjoying it vicariously. I had my own angel, a man named Bill Jordan. When I was in my 20s and 30s, he was in his 50s and 60s. He taught me a lot. I owe much of my success to Bill. "/>
			<outline text="The best revolutions embrace all that was learned in past revolutions. Keep your eyes open, understand how the system you're trying to undermine really works. Bill Gates never said publicly that he was going to take IBM out of its strategic place in the software business. For all I know, he didn't even intend to do it. Looking at it from my insider perspective, while all this was going on, I know they had doubts about their ability to lead the industry as late as 1990."/>
			<outline text="That's why I say it isn't about open source, it's about open minds. Drawing lines alienates people to you. Attacking Microsoft verbally causes Windows users to tune out. You can't undermine by trying to dictate the terms, you have to do it by invading at night, slipping in the back door unnoticed. Then when the old folks wake up, it's too damned late."/>
			<outline text="So, speaking as an old geezer to a bunch of young whippersnappers, let's really cause some trouble, keep your eyes and ears open and stop attacking so openly. "/>
			<outline text="A new slogan. It goes right along with the old slogans, Dig We Must, Let's Have Fun, Namaste Y'all."/>

		<outline text="Calling All DTDs!" created="4/29/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="callingAllDtds" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Calling All DTDs!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/29/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="April is drawing to a close, and what's next, May, of course."/>
			<outline text="A warning to those who don't like the touchy-feely part of DaveNet. There's little doubt that some of the feely pieces are coming soooon. "/>
			<outline text="Early May is when I was born, so many years ago. I practice self-indulgence at the big holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. But the biggest holiday of all is the one that I share with approx 1/365th of the population. Be warned. I'm probably going to share some of my truths, in a friendly way of course, sometime next week."/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, let's look at the surface, thru the lens of the software industry that provides a structure for so much learning about humans."/>
			<outline text="***Linux has love!"/>
			<outline text="So much of my experience with Linux is thru the postings and emails from the Linux zealots, who remind me much of the Mac zealots who protested loudly as I and others wrote about the retreat of the Mac OS as a platform of importance under the leadership of Sculley, Spindler and Amelio. If these people really had the interests of their OS at heart, my argument goes, they'd beat me with a feather instead of throwing rocks at me. Rocks hurt but feathers are fun."/>
			<outline text="But to be fair, some of the voices, usually quieter ones, speak with respect and patience and statesmanlike behavior. I make an effort to pay more attention to these voices. For example, about a year ago, a gentle man, whose name I don't remember, sent me an email offering to come to my office and install a Linux machine, free of charge. I declined, we were in the end-game of our Windows port, heads-down, there was no time for me to learn another OS while I was already learning a new OS. But I remember the elegance of this person's pitch. It made a big impression."/>
			<outline text="About open source, I want to add that I like the idea. It's how I learned how to program,  back in the 70s as a grad student at UW-Madison. I had the source to the original Unix. I was delighted with the airy open-ness of the code, how straightforward it was. It taught me how real software is built in ways that professors can't. I was the total beneficiary of open source as a young person. "/>
			<outline text="I owe so much to Dennis Richie, the lead developer of Unix, for having the good sense to see that his code could be used to teach a new generation of programmers, including me, how to build clean well-engineered, straightforward stuff. When I release code I think of Richie, a man who I spoke with several times when I was younger, and feel like I'm doing my part to keep the big wheel turning."/>
			<outline text="***Platform advocacy"/>
			<outline text="But I ramble. I want to point you to the most elegant platform advocacy document I've ever seen, the Linux Advocacy Mini-HOWTO:"/>
			<outline text="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/Advocacy.html "/>
			<outline text="Please clear out a few minutes and read the whole thing, top to bottom. Don't skip a word. You may find, as I did, that you get a whole different idea of what Linux is about. "/>
			<outline text="I wish the Mac had such a document. I wish Windows had one too, although the Windows culture, as I experience it, pretty much adopts these ideas without explicit statement. To me, it says that advocating a platform does not entitle you to use that advocacy for your own purposes. It shows that Linux is rooted in respect for other points of view."/>
			<outline text="It's an incredible example of what I mean by keeping your eye on the prize. Know what you want and get it. The core of the Linux world wants the rest of the world to respect Linux. That's the best goal. It's totally attainable. "/>
			<outline text="Here's my answer. Just by asking for respect, you get it. It's automatic!"/>
			<outline text="***WebDAV"/>
			<outline text="A milestone piece appeared on the InfoWorld website a few hours ago, written by Jeff Walsh who is bringing accurate and balanced reporting to the new standards for XML and net content management."/>
			<outline text="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980428.wiwebdav.htm "/>
			<outline text="I'm quoted in the piece, thanks Jeff, but that's not why it's noteworthy."/>
			<outline text="WebDAV, which I've written about before, is important because it opens the door to managed content, and gets the toolmakers to work together instead of trying to be everything to everyone, which no one can be. "/>
			<outline text="I think NetObjects, Macromedia and Adobe should be enthusiastic supporters of WebDAV because it means growth for them. "/>
			<outline text="Well-run sites are the result of collaboration between writers, designers, graphic artists, and system managers. WebDAV is the first step towards standard protocols that enable collaboration over the net. "/>
			<outline text="People who develop and manage web content should voice their support for WebDAV to the tools vendors, with respect of course, because it will empower them to plug in new tools without overwhelming team members with details they aren't interested in. "/>
			<outline text="Writers write. Designers design. Graphics people sweat the pixels and systems people keep the whole thing flowing. That's the nirvana that WebDAV makes possible. We're enthusiastic supporters, we're implementing both sides of DAV. We hope everyone else gets on the bandwagon."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun folks! It's a big world out there, we're all part of it."/>
			<outline text="***DTDs"/>
			<outline text="Thanks to Lisa Rein, a friend with very strong opinions, I'm exploring XML at a deeper level, venturing into territory that used to scare me, but no longer does."/>
			<outline text="A DTD is a Document Type Definition. Without a DTD, XML information is just tagged text, with no rules about what can contain what. "/>
			<outline text="It's hardly a new concept, but it is new to web content, where part of the charm of HTML is its lack of rigor, its anything-goes attitude. HTML has gotten us somewhere good, a publishing medium that's accessible to millions. It allows us to get our message thru even if we don't own a printing press or have a large editorial team or use expensive workflow and typesetting software. All those people and money and software can make things boring. Get the overhead out of the way and something interesting can happen. Anyway..."/>
			<outline text="Back to DTDs. Here's an example of some simple XML text:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;computer&gt;">
				<outline text="&amp;lt;brand&gt;Dell&amp;lt;/brand&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;model&gt;Latitude CP&amp;lt;/model&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;ram&gt;64MB&amp;lt;/ram&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;os&gt;Windows NT 4.0&amp;lt;/os&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;user&gt;Bull Mancuso&amp;lt;/user&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;user&gt;Bart Simpson&amp;lt;/user&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&amp;lt;/computer&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Now here's a DTD for that text:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!ELEMENT computer (brand, model, ram, os, user+)&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!ELEMENT brand (#PCDATA)&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!ELEMENT model (#PCDATA)&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!ELEMENT ram (#PCDATA)&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!ELEMENT os (#PCDATA)&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!ELEMENT user (#PCDATA)&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Armed with this DTD, a piece of software can look at a bit of XML text and tell you yay or nay. Does it describe a computer? If so, it's OK to typeset it or store it in a database. If not, the author has to go back and fix mistakes until it passes the validation test."/>
			<outline text="***Why?"/>
			<outline text="Now I don't claim to be an expert on this stuff, so please be patient with me. I'm learning. People who are new to DaveNet might not know that sometimes I throw up a straw-man, an assertion, a carefully labeled assumption in the hope that it will be refuted if it is incorrect. I like to learn quickly, so if you know more, please just send me an email, and keep it respectful. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="I'm assuming that the people who invented DTDs wanted the tagged text to flow into a database, and such software often has rigid rules about what each record can contain. There are only so many fields, and if you get information that contains more or less than what you require, that can spell trouble; wasted time, wasted money, inaccurate information, burnt braincells."/>
			<outline text="So if the DTD says it's OK, go ahead and do whatever processing you were going to do, safe in the knowledge that it's all there and at least at a structural level correct. Other rules may apply, semantic rules, that the DTD can't help with, so other kinds of error checking is needed in some situations."/>
			<outline text="If all this is true, I understand why we disconnected on DTDs, because our database, the one that Frontier is built around, doesn't have rigid rules about what can appear where. There really isn't a need for DTDs in our world, but they will be showing up, along with the XML-based information we hope to store and manage and send out, perhaps to software that is more rigid than ours, so we're going to have to embrace DTDs, at some level."/>
			<outline text="***Calling all DTDs!"/>
			<outline text="I like to learn by example. I've never been that good at reading specs. They usually make sense to me only *after* I understand the basic principles. I roll around in examples until a lightbulb goes on. Then and only then does the spec make sense. "/>
			<outline text="So I put together a web application that's designed to capture, store and serve DTDs to help me and others understand how they work. If you're building XML-based applications and describing the data in DTD format, please share what you have, let's build a library of DTDs:"/>
			<outline text="http://betty.userland.com/dtd/default.wsf "/>
			<outline text="If you or someone you know is working here, please share what you've built. "/>
			<outline text="That's how we'll have fun and move forward together."/>
			<outline text="Have a grrrreat day!"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;4/30/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A couple of years ago, apalled with the quality of service at my Internet service provider, I went shopping, using the Internet of course, for a new service provider. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/96/07/thecompaqofisps.html "/>
			<outline text="It worked, I hooked up with Conxion, and have been pleased with the service ever since."/>
			<outline text="I chose Conxion because they talked to me like a customer. They were willing to bet on the service alongside me. I got the first six months on evaluation. If I wasn't pleased I could cancel the account and I would pay nothing. When the six months were over, I wrote the check, and I've been happy with Conxion ever since."/>
			<outline text="I also chose Conxion because a very large company, Microsoft, chose them to distribute their software. I knew that my flow would be smaller than Microsoft's, and I reasoned that I would probably get the same bandwidth and connectivity, if not as much attention, as Microsoft would."/>
			<outline text="***A fly in the ointment"/>
			<outline text="As good as it's been being a Conxion customer, there's a problem, whose nature I don't fully understand, but whose effect I totally do."/>
			<outline text="Some people, because of how they connect to the Internet, cannot reach my site. The illusion that the Internet provides universal connectivity is just that. There are some places you can't get to, and that changes from day to day. Some days you can get thru, then Laurel and Hardy kick in, they trip over a wire, and all of a sudden you can't connect."/>
			<outline text="An email was posted on the Frontier-central list earlier today, by Stephen Waters, sbwaters@rny.com, publisher the Rome Sentinel and a longtime Frontier webmaster. We have a relationship with Mr. Waters, but we're losing that relationship because he can no longer connect to our server. "/>
			<outline text="He says &quot;I never realized how much I look forward to looking at Scripting News each morning!&quot; The fact that he, and many others, can't get thru to our server is a major business problem for my company, one that we must get to the bottom of, and solve."/>
			<outline text="***Digex"/>
			<outline text="We first heard about the current round of disconnects last week. I've been getting a steady stream of messages about the situation. Every time someone's gotten to the bottom of the problem, it turns out to be a routing problem between Digex and Conxion. The management of Conxion has been made aware of the problem, now I want to be sure that the management of Digex is also aware. "/>
			<outline text="[To the management at Digex, I want to be clear, I am not an employee or shareholder of Conxion. I am a content and tools provider that connects to the net thru Conxion.]"/>
			<outline text="If you are a Digex user and a DaveNet or Scripting News reader, the only way we can communicate is thru email, assuming that works. I have no direct influence over Digex, since I am not a customer of theirs, but if you are, please let them know about this problem and ask them about their plans to fix it."/>
			<outline text="We can solve this problem anyway, even without the help of the ISPs. We can gather information so we understand what it is about the Internet that needs fixing, what kinds of service standards we want to set for our service providers, and what our rights are, as customers and net users. "/>
			<outline text="We're getting closer to the ideal, an ISP world where the S word is taken seriously. We're getting closer, but we're not there yet."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: One possible solution is to mirror our site somewhere else on the Internet, a place we can get to and Digex customers can get to. In the next few months it will become easier, at a technical level, for us to do that."/>

			<outline text="Imagine this -- a rally in New York to plead the economic case for Microsoft, the richest company in the world."/>
			<outline text="Is there anything he won't do? "/>
			<outline text="And why does he do it?"/>
			<outline text="***Making it"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Some day I'm going to make it, and when I make it, they'll forget the things they say.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="This was a line from a song written by a teenage friend of mine, when I was a teenager. I was a sound man (or more accurately sound boy) for the band. I liked being around the creativity, even if I wasn't a singer or a guitar player, I liked to design sound systems with very little money. "/>
			<outline text="Hey, so, the problem with the line is that it isn't true."/>
			<outline text="A more accurate line would be &quot;Some day I'm going to make it, and when I make it, people will say 'He's rich, so why should I worry about him?'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Or, &quot;Some day I'm going to make it, and when I make it, people will say 'The house is too big, they can't be happy there.'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="When you make it, people don't want to hear what you have to say any more than they did before you made it. In fact, I think they want to hear you even less. Listening isn't based on how much money you have. Write that down and remember it. If you're waiting to be heard and think that having money will make a difference, trust me, it won't."/>
			<outline text="Look at Bill Gates! Could he possibly make more money? Could it possibly make a difference to him, to his family, to the government, to anyone? What does he want to buy with that money? Isn't that why you make money, so you can buy things? I'm really confused. Is there another purpose to money that I haven't figured out yet? I wonder I wonder."/>
			<outline text="Hey, one thing's for sure, people think more about rich people, but don't confuse that with listening. Are any of those thoughts grounded in reality? When we talk about Gates are we talking about a man or a huge bank account? I have no idea. Probably neither. What we say has more to do with ourselves. We give our pain to Gates, and he must like it, or else why is he always in such great position to receive our pain?"/>
			<outline text="***The lady from Niger and the tiger"/>
			<outline text="I've been exchanging email with a fellow named Lymond, he says it's just a made up name, that he's really a famous person, but I don't care. He sent me a limerick about what it's like snuggling up with Bill Gates:"/>
			<outline text="There once was a lady from Niger who smiled as she rode on a tiger. They returned from the ride with the lady inside and the smile on the face of the tiger. "/>
			<outline text="I'm going to think about this one."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;stupidDog&quot;&gt;Yo quiero Taco Bell!&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="I always catch onto these things late. I got into the Macarena just as people were getting sick of it. At the local record store the clerk says &quot;Now you can be the last person on your block to get the Macarena!&quot; It's so funny! And it happened again."/>
			<outline text="For the last few weeks my favorite commercials have been the ones with the stupid Taco Bell dog. In the first commercial he's walking up a fire escape, and then pauses in a window and asks a man inside an apartment for some of his Taco Bell, probably a taco, but we find out later that they may also have burritos."/>
			<outline text="Later in the series the dog is playing basketball with Shaquille O'Neil, and speaking at huge rallies in revolutionary Mexico. He always has one thing to say. Yo quiero Taco Bell! (I want Taco Bell!)"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, they've had a few misses, but mostly it's been very intriguing TV advertising. I can imagine it would be irritating if you didn't like the dog, but I really do like the dog, especially the way his eyebrows move, so I always watch the commercials when they come on."/>
			<outline text="I thought I had seen it all until last night when I saw a Jack In the Box ad, with Jack, the antenna-top version, talking to a stupid dog that looks just the one in the Taco Bell commercials. He's lecturing him. He says &quot;Of course you like Taco Bell, but you're a dog!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Jack rambles a little, they show some pictures of their sandwiches (totally unnecessary) and then the camera focuses the dog, looking very embarassed, and Jack asks confidently, OK, now who ate the beans?&quot; The dog gets a really nervous sick look on his face, just like in the Taco Bell commercials, and the commercial ends."/>
			<outline text="Bravo! "/>
			<outline text="***That had nothing to do with Bill Gates"/>
			<outline text="It just proves that there's more going on in the world than the Internet and money and the struggle to be heard. The dog is cool, and Taco Bell owns him, for a while. Then some ad guy at some agency realizes that he could get a dog too and that dog could eat dog food and like all dogs that we love, the dog farts. Yay!"/>
			<outline text="It's great when we have the courage to laugh. Competition with humor is the best idea. Remember IBM's nuns and the Internet? Let's have fun. Why not? Everyone's so serious. Me too. Let's get over it before life is over."/>
			<outline text="***Training people"/>
			<outline text="I forgive Chris Nolan and all the other women who joke about training men to be their idea of what a man should be. Let's also forgive the men who go for that in a woman. We all have our struggles, me too. I suppose I want to train women, and they resist that. I want to train the world to listen to me, but the world resists that too. Over and over we learn the lesson that we're just little pups with grand visions, waiting to lead a revolution, wanting to be heard by someone, anyone, lest we die in anonymity. In the end we die, and who cares? Probably no one. It happens every day."/>
			<outline text="The universe is so damned big. Billions and billions of galaxies. Every one of them filled with chihuahuas and captains of industry. None of them get out of it alive. What's it all about? Who knows? No one."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Time Changes Everything&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/7/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I spent much of yesterday emailing with Microsoft people. "/>
			<outline text="Now I'd like to explain my point of view to people at Microsoft, and do it openly, assuming that the questions and arguments were coming to me in good faith, and that my responses will be seen in the same way."/>
			<outline text="***It can't be about money"/>
			<outline text="One common thread -- Microsoft isn't about money. If it were, Bill Gates would have retired a long time ago. No one needs $50 billion or even $100 million to achieve complete personal financial independence. "/>
			<outline text="The money is needed for some other purpose, or it might be irrelevant. Microsoft has many shareholders. Many of them are employees. Some of them retire when they get rich, and others stay on. For those who stay on, it's not likely that money is the motivator."/>
			<outline text="So what actually motivates Microsoft? "/>
			<outline text="***A computer on every desk?"/>
			<outline text="One correspondent says it's the vision of a computer on every desk and a computer in every home. Stated another way, the goal is to improve the lives of everyone through computing. "/>
			<outline text="I think this is naive. If we judged all Microsoft actions against this vision, we'd find a fair number of things that Microsoft does that aren't furthering the cause of putting a computer on every desk and in every home."/>
			<outline text="A revealing example. What if some day a developer shipped a killer product that could dramatically further the cause of a computer on every desk and in every home, but it wasn't from Microsoft, and (humor me), it required Microsoft to disappear in order for the vision to be achieved? Would Microsoft's board of directors vote to shut the company down so the vision could be accomplished? "/>
			<outline text="No company can operate with that as its mission. It makes for good press releases, it may even help internal Microsoft managers make decisions about their products, but can't be the reason Microsoft exists."/>
			<outline text="Of course I'm not the judge of this, so if Gates or a Microsoft exec or director wants to set me straight, go for it."/>
			<outline text="***What do I really think?"/>
			<outline text="Absent any other credible statement of purpose, I think Microsoft is just a ouija board, a self-perpetuating organization that must grow twenty percent per year profitably, or collapse on itself. "/>
			<outline text="In other words Microsoft is a corporation."/>
			<outline text="The corporate system forces a relentless pace of growth. It can't stop on its own, Gates as the CEO of the company either has to feed its self-perpetuation need, or get out of the way for someone else to do it. "/>
			<outline text="That's the structure imposed on Microsoft, as a public company. If anyone or anything deserves our criticism, it's the corporate economic system. "/>
			<outline text="But Microsoft people want to know why I care what motivates Microsoft. Read on..."/>
			<outline text="***Time changes everything"/>
			<outline text="The Microsoft of 1998 is not comparable to the Microsoft of 1988."/>
			<outline text="Over and over I hear Microsoft people not connecting with this."/>
			<outline text="The rules that applied in the late 80s don't apply in the late 90s because Microsoft has a near-monopoly position in the operating system and application businesses, and it uses those positions to further cement the strength of each of them. Over time the lock-in increases. "/>
			<outline text="The lock-in process has nothing to do with the quality of product or the economic cost to users and computer vendors. It's a philosophic challenge our country has dealt with before, and in the past we decided that it's not in our interest to allow this kind of lock-in to happen."/>
			<outline text="It's become clear that Microsoft will never regulate its own power without outside intervention. Without regulation, Microsoft has power that's unsupportable. As the government case has trickled out, it's become clear that Microsoft uses this power in shocking ways. And step by step Microsoft is retreating, dismantling the system, but, I think missing that nothing short of a restructuring, agreeing to very different but reasonable rules, is the only way it will avoid a retreat to the unthinkable place, a collapse of its system."/>
			<outline text="I don't believe Microsoft's innovation argument. Systems could easily be set up that deliver lower cost choices to consumers. Product quality could be improved. Many of the best developers will never work for Microsoft. There are many users who prefer not to use Microsoft products. Microsoft represents only one way to make software. There are others, and those ways aren't getting a chance because Microsoft has distribution lock-in. They have the power to keep other ideas from gaining distribution, and they use that power. I believe if there were no lock-in the pace of innovation would increase, and the cost to consumers would decrease, and the quality of the software would go up. This is my opinion, I can't prove it, but neither can Microsoft disprove it."/>
			<outline text="***Choices"/>
			<outline text="A decision has to be made, if not now, soon. If the courts decide that Microsoft must be allowed to continue without government intervention, I'm sure they'll keep growing, and eventually, at some point, the question will be revisited and someday, I'm sure of it, their growth will be stopped by act of government. "/>
			<outline text="The only choice is for Microsoft to back down, develop a philosophy that goes beyond self-perpetuation. Or they can punt, Microsoft can become several corporations, each of which is behaves as any corporation would, with self-perpetuation as their main goal, without the advantage of controlling the distribution system."/>
			<outline text="***Is there a philosophy?"/>
			<outline text="So there is the background. That's why, in all seriousness, I keep asking what Microsoft is about, why Bill Gates keeps going for more. If there was a philosophy that went beyond self-perpetuation, at least we could evaluate their claim that it's best to leave them alone. But all we get is silence and uncoordinated outdated naivete and staged press events. I don't actually believe that they think we're stupid, rather I think they haven't thought it through, they haven't updated their own view of the world to incorporate the power that they now have that they didn't used to have."/>
			<outline text="Recently I asked a Microsoft product manager to give me a single adjective to describe the company. The word he came up with was &quot;scrappy&quot;. There's the disconnect, so clear you can't miss it. Scrappy worked for the old Microsoft but the new Microsoft dominates. Disconnect. You can't be both dominant and scrappy. It doesn't work."/>
			<outline text="***Creativity"/>
			<outline text="I don't know why I believe in the creativity of Bill Gates. Some people say it's foolish to. But I think I've seen it and I think he's missing something important. He won. You can't win any more than he's already won. The game is over. Now the question is what does the playing field look like in the aftermath. Does he want to loop back around, and run a smaller part of Microsoft? Will he accept some rules about what Microsoft can and can't do to link their disparate businesses? Will he jump in front of the train, far enough, and self-impose some rules? If he were as driven by creativity as he is driven to dominate, he could see this as a challenge of a lifetime. Or he could continue down the road he's been going down, and retreat, step by step, flailing in the wind of public opinion."/>
			<outline text="That's basically what I've been saying in DaveNet, since early 1996 when the dimension of Microsoft's attack on the Internet became clear. Diversity was the loser, and don't miss this, it also required huge incompetence of their challengers. But the result is the same either way. Microsoft is back in power, only they're much bigger and more dominant this time around. All of Microsoft's denials, public opinion polls, outdated internal thinking, staged rallies, can't refute this. They don't deserve the public trust to be anything other than an attack machine, because that's what they are, and they've offered nothing believable to refute this view."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft as an attack machine was acceptable when they weren't dominant. Now that they control the software on almost all personal computers, and have the high ground to enter any market they choose to, everyone outside of Microsoft has an interest in understanding what their motivation is, and if the motivation is unacceptable, to impose limits on them."/>
			<outline text="So there's the next challenge for Microsoft and Bill Gates. The world changed, largely due to their actions. Now, in this new world, please define Microsoft and say what Bill Gates wants."/>

			<outline text="A brief public note of thanks to Steve Jobs for having the guts to back off the Rhapsody dual operating system strategy. The new strategy, called OS X, is basically a reincarnation of Copland, which was a *good idea* from the early nineties that wasn't well executed. "/>
			<outline text="Roughly, the Copland plan was to close various holes in the Macintosh OS that allowed programs to do things that couldn't work under a fully pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system. Most of the OS remains intact. A few interfaces have to go. A minor transition for developers. "/>
			<outline text="The benefit, Mac software can be as powerful and sophisticated and perform as well as software for other real-time operating systems such as Unix and Windows NT. It was clear that the Mac OS needed to go this way, but previous Apple management didn't get there."/>
			<outline text="As a longtime critic and public advisor to Apple, it's gratifying to see them make moves that make sense. "/>
			<outline text="***Investment money for developers"/>
			<outline text="In early 1996 I outlined a plan for the revival of Apple. Jobs is pretty much executing that plan, with one major exception. "/>

			<outline text="There's still no money available from investors for Mac-based development. This will probably be a challenge, but it really shouldn't be. The Mac OS remains the best alternative to Windows, with a deep application software base and millions of users of all levels of technical skills. It should be a good developer market. "/>
			<outline text="***Competing with Apple"/>
			<outline text="We still compete with Apple, but it's easier to compete with a strong hypester like Steve Jobs. In the past we got in trouble with many users for promoting our product, I think largely because Apple wasn't promoting their products well. Competing with college professors is very difficult, I learned."/>
			<outline text="Now Apple isn't ashamed to promote the value of system-level scripting for the Macintosh. It's a huge win for people building publishing systems, an area where we have chosen to specialize. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/appleScript/comparison/default.html "/>

			<outline text="Dan Shafer, now the top guy at CNet's builder.com has a fascinating article today, well worth reading."/>
			<outline text="http://www.builder.com/Business/Shafer/051898/?st.bl.fd.ts2.mbcol "/>
			<outline text="He begins: &quot;First there was free Web-based email. Several companies came up with the notion of free email supported by advertising, but a few refined the idea by putting email on the Web. Suddenly you could read and respond to your email from anywhere, whether or not you carried a portable computer. Cybercafes, all-night copy shops, friends' homes and offices, trade show floors, and local libraries furnished all the access you needed.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="His theme is that email is just the first application to be brought to the web. Over time, more and more of the computer we use will migrate to a server, and as that happens the laptops we carry with us can get thinner and easier."/>
			<outline text="It's an oft-heard theme, from Larry Ellison and Scott McNealy and other proponents of network computing. Is Java central? Not yet. HTML works great, for some apps at least. "/>
			<outline text="Calendaring, which Shafer singles out as a future opportunity, is a client-server app, and a web-based interface makes a lot of sense. Even if you could craft a better interface in C, who cares? Shafer posits that such a service would be as big as HotMail, and I agree."/>
			<outline text="***Director, Doom and...?"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, web-based apps may not be the only way to go. Especially with more full-time net-connected users, cable modems and DSL, it's becoming more realistic to assume that at least some users have machines that can be &quot;pushed&quot; to, allowing for higher-level apps to manage the display of database-stored local information. It may end up in a web browser display, as an option, but other prettier forms of display such as Director apps, or custom apps (e.g. Doom) also make sense with high-bandwidth full-time net connections. "/>
			<outline text="These push apps are sure to flow thru HTTP because of firewalls, with the client machine running a web server cast in a different role from the page servers that are so popular today. In my opinion, XML-formatted procedure calls are definitely the way to go for the next generation of non-browser-based distributed computing."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft Office"/>
			<outline text="This relates to the discussion that's been happening on the last couple of Scripting News mail pages, centering around Microsoft's application strategy, how Office came to be, and how it left behind applications from Lotus, WordPerfect and Borland."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail980520.html "/>
			<outline text="It's been mostly historic, there hasn't been much discussion of where the Office apps are going, probably because the opinions come from ex-Microsoft people who in the past worked on the Office apps. "/>
			<outline text="No matter what, it's hard to imagine the Office apps migrating to becoming browser-based, nor does it make sense (to me at least) that it's worth it to convert a spreadsheet or word processor to run in the context of a web browser. "/>
			<outline text="I'm fishing for ideas. Please speak up if you see how it could make sense."/>
			<outline text="***They do need to innovate"/>
			<outline text="Are Microsoft's productivity apps in a cul-de-sac? Can they go anywhere interesting from here? If there's room for new collaborative versions of the Office apps, at the top-level, will they work differently from their pre-Internet counterparts? Are spreadsheets and word processors enabling surfaces for collaborative work, or is something else needed? No matter what, Microsoft is in a race with everyone else to figure out what's going on here and to then implement it."/>
			<outline text="So Microsoft's we-need-to-innovate argument has teeth. They totally do. They aren't finished navigating. From this point on, no matter what the government makes an issue of, they pretty much have to figure it out for themselves, there's no visible competition in apps to boost them."/>
			<outline text="***Floatillas?"/>
			<outline text="Of course a flotilla of small independent companies will explore all possible niches. Will Microsoft go down a singular path or will they launch their own flotilla? Or are they depending on buying up all the ships, or having the option to? Where are the other piles of money on this? IBM? Oracle? Intel? The cable companies? The TV networks? Everyone else?"/>
			<outline text="With the success of HotMail, venture capitalists surely are funding dozens of startups to try variants of the HotMail approach. If there was a cohesive cross-company strategy behind the VC-backed products, they might not have to worry about Microsoft. Of course cohesive cross-company strategies are practically unknown in this industry, so time may be on Microsoft's side, as many of the VCs are betting it is. "/>
			<outline text="There's big money to be made here either way. Microsoft paid $400 million for HotMail, and today there's a report of AOL purchasing a leading chat software vendor for $300 million. Whether or not such applications make the cash register ring, it's clear that they're worthwhile entrepreneurial investments, making it sure that we'll see a glut of such applications in a few quarters. "/>
			<outline text="***A treadmill?"/>
			<outline text="One of the Mail Page writers, Kornel Marton, says that Microsoft is on a treadmill, they must keep growing at 30 percent per year to keep their stock option game rolling. If it should fail, Microsoft is history, he says."/>
			<outline text="I don't agree. Microsoft is a big bank account, the biggest installed base, and the biggest commercial software distribution system. They own stock in Apple, Comcast and many other companies. A rising tide works in their favor as long as they invest, upgrade and distribute wisely. Not all of Microsoft's investments flow thru the campus in Redmond."/>
			<outline text="If their internal developers become inefficient compared to those outside, it's possible for them to let go of that model and shift to a new one. It'll be a big change, bigger than any proposed by the government, if and when it happens."/>
			<outline text="It's a line that Apple crossed in the early 90s when outside developers had become more efficient than inner ones, and the internal ones were stalled. Apple ignored the opportunity. Will Microsoft, if it should happen that way for them? "/>
			<outline text="One more question. It all seems to revolve around Microsoft this week. Will it always be that way?"/>

			<outline text="***Best of Class"/>
			<outline text="In its June cover story, Windows Magazine rated the top Windows shareware software products, and Frontier 5.0.1 got Best of Class in HTML Authoring. This is great, so far we've been pretty much overlooked by the PC magazines. That's OK, we're in it for the long-haul, I think. But it's great to break thru. Ye-hi!"/>

			<outline text="This is the first such honor for our Windows software. I am very proud of what our team, Doug Baron, Bob Bierman, Brent Simmons, against great odds, has accomplished. Thank you Windows Magazine for the acknowledgement!"/>
			<outline text="But as yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/05/rhapsodyCancelled.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; said, we haven't forgotten our roots in the Macintosh OS. Read on..."/>
			<outline text="***Rhapsody Cancelled?"/>
			<outline text="According to Steve Jobs, the interim CEO of Apple, yes, Rhapsody is cancelled. He was quoted yesterday in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal saying so. However, other Apple people are spinning it differently. "/>
			<outline text="From mwatson@apple.com: &quot;We should have just announced that we were taking the product that was codenamed Rhapsody and officially calling it Mac OS X, shipping in 1999 with the Carbon APIs to ease porting efforts, and the Blue Box for existing binaries.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="OK, never mind how it's being spun, what really happened? From my point of view, a rather large cloud was lifted over the future of the Macintosh OS. Apple decided, wisely, to go with a continuous approach rather than ask developers to commit major resources to supporting a completely new way of doing things."/>
			<outline text="Apple *will* offer what was once called Rhapsody, at least that's the current plan; but will not attempt to migrate the base of Mac application software to that OS. So the Rhapsody idea has been cancelled, even if the bits that make up Rhapsody go on."/>
			<outline text="It's a good idea because it wasn't going to happen. There aren't a lot of development dollars chasing Apple platforms. That's realistic. So rather than create a problem for developers by training users to judge developers based on support of an OS with a very small user base, they're listening to developers and promoting a small change with a potentially huge benefit for users. "/>
			<outline text="There's still something objectionable about the way they're promoting the new strategy. The new plan is called Carbon, and they say &quot;All life is carbon-based,&quot; leading to the inevitable conclusion that if you don't support Carbon, you're dead. "/>
			<outline text="Already I've gotten email from MORE users wondering if this is the last straw for the old classic program that I created in the 80s that some people still use. No, of course it isn't the end, because even if MORE isn't clean enough to run under the Carbon interfaces (it might be), Apple has said that old apps will still run on future versions of the Mac OS."/>
			<outline text="In other words, in their zeal to get developers on the bandwagon, they have unnecessarily raised fears among some users, and thereby created a problem for developers. I forgive them, they're doing better, the Jobs-run Apple is much more in tune with developers than previous incarnations of Apple. Net-net it's getting better, and that's good."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="Last week I wrote &quot;Time Changes Everything&quot; about and for Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I probed, looking and asking for a mission statement that goes beyond the normal self-perpetuating mission that all corporations must have.

			<outline text="I'm disappointed, but not devastated. I think enough time has passed, and now it's time to look where we're all going in relation to Microsoft. Even if they don't have a vision for us, there's nothing stopping us from developing our own vision. Even though the software world appears to revolve around Microsoft, it doesn't have to be that way forever."/>
			<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;keyquestion&quot;&gt;***Key question&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="As I think about this stuff, I want to know to what extent Microsoft controls the personal computer distribution system. Are Compaq, Dell, IBM, et al franchisees or are they truly independent? Under what conditions can Microsoft take their licenses away? At will? A violation of the terms of the distribution agreement? And what do the agreements look like? Are they confidential? If so, why? Does Microsoft have any real competition in operating systems? Do they really need to keep these agreements confidential?"/>
			<outline text="I'm in favor of the government filing an anti-trust suit against Microsoft if for no other reason than it will force disclosure of the business deals they have with the hardware OEMs. Very little light has been shed on these deals. I want to see the whole thing so I can decide for myself how locked in I am with my software investment."/>
			<outline text="My opinion is that Microsoft could put any of these OEMs out of business any day they want to. I think this has forced the demise of many would-be competitors of Microsoft, going back to Quarterdeck, GeoWorks and DR-DOS. "/>
			<outline text="***Another question"/>
			<outline text="The most common complaint from the would-be Microsoft competitors is the pricing policy that forces the OEMs to pay for Windows even if they don't install it on a customer's computer. So if GeoWorks convinced a customer to use their software, the customer would pay for Windows anyway. "/>
			<outline text="Now, I'm in the same place. I wanted to use Windows NT Workstation as my home platform for future versions of Frontier, but learned that there's a 10-connection limit on this version of the operating system, which really limits it to being a workstation, not a server. "/>
			<outline text="That sounds reasonable until you realize that over time Microsoft is sure to add features similar to my software to their much higher priced NT Server product. So the customer will get something like my software from Microsoft at no extra cost. How much money is available for my company, even if my product is better, more innovative, higher performance or less expensive?"/>
			<outline text="See the hole in Microsoft's innovation argument? They're lowering costs? Hmmm. NT Server costs much more. I'm interested in hearing a rebuttal."/>
			<outline text="What do I want? A plain-vanilla, low-priced modern OS from Microsoft that allows a somewhat level playing field. It can't be all that level, by the way, since Microsoft has 30,000 employees and billions of dollars and I have no money and only 4 employees. Why do they need this stupid advantage? What are they so scared of?"/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;microsoftsBoguDaysAreGone&quot;&gt;Microsoft's BOGU days are gone&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="One of the things I used to admire about Microsoft is a philosophy called BOGU, which stood for Bend Over and Grease Up. It was a reminder that they would take it up the butt for the bigger prize. "/>
			<outline text="I think dealing with IBM taught them the value of BOGU, and they learned it well. Keep your wits about you, keep doing the BOGU thing, and eventually the big bear will screw up, and you'll end up on top."/>
			<outline text="We all live BOGU lives. If you have family or friends you're always doing it. No relationship is perfectly balanced. If you're in business and have customers you're boguing all the time. You know, the customer is always right. That's big big bogu."/>
			<outline text="Bogu says there are other points of view, and sometimes you have to yield to them, let them have their way."/>
			<outline text="I've been watching Microsoft lose this way, there has been a change in attitude. Yes, they're scrappy, but there's also a very careless attitude. I think they care less and less what other people think about them. "/>
			<outline text="***Examples"/>
			<outline text="When they went on the offensive against Netscape, they ignored the web developers who were caught in the middle, the majority of whom used and continue to use Netscape's browser as the benchmark for web compatibility. Did those people see themselves as Microsoft developers? Emphatically no. The web was a wonderful way to escape Microsoft control and a lot of people wanted that."/>
			<outline text="When Microsoft rewrote Java for Windows to be COM-specific they disenfranchised the Java developers who wanted Write Once Run Anywhere. They claim that their Java is fully compatible with Sun's, but they played a nasty psychological game with the developers who wanted WORA. They could have commited to supporting WORA, it would have cost them very little, and would have won them the friendship of developers who don't want to be Windows developers but want to have their software run well on Windows."/>
			<outline text="When they were ordered to take MSIE out of Windows 95 they played dumb and offered the judge a set of ridiculous choices. They could have asked me or anyone outside of Microsoft with technical knowledge to help them plot a win-win. Instead they tried to publicly humiliate the judge. That was a very sad day for me, I was actually at Microsoft the day the story came out. I told them &quot;This won't work.&quot; I was so embarassed to be part of the software industry that day. Such childish behavior from a 20-something company run by 40-something men. So unbecoming. Totally embarassing."/>
			<outline text="The shit hit the fan for me last week with the staged rally and rigged poll. First the rally. I believe they can shut down Compaq or Dell any day they want to. To parade the CEOs of the companies around as if they had independent opinions while there's a gun pointed at their bottom line is the ultimate insult to everyone else's intelligence. Do they think we're stupid? "/>
			<outline text="The poll was even more insulting. The questions were one-sided and the results totally predictable. They asked if people believed in lawsuits (no), higher taxes (no) and government interference in business (no), without asking questions about Microsoft's business practices (unfair) and the value of diversity in the software world (high). "/>
			<outline text="Before I got into software, in my freshman year of college, I took a political science course on polling. I don't claim to be an expert, not by any means. But the one lesson I took away is that you can get any result you want from a poll by asking a question from a point of view. "/>
			<outline text="There are certain beliefs that color the whole population. If you trigger those beliefs, you can ask any question and get an irrelevant response. Politicial scientists are fascinated with this. I guess the point is that if you want to get an accurate reading of public opinion, you have to offer people real choices and force them to think, not just react to buzzwords."/>
			<outline text="Interestingly, a public web poll conducted by MSNBC, a Microsoft subsidiary, revealed that at least some people want Microsoft to separate the browser from the OS, think that Microsoft has violated anti-trust laws, think the government should delay the introduction of Windows 98, and that Microsoft should be broken up into separate companies."/>
			<outline text="http://www.msnbc.com/modules/quizzes/microsoft.asp "/>
			<outline text="***I'm a customer"/>
			<outline text="I am a Microsoft customer. I use a Windows laptop and desktop system, alongside my Macs. I use Windows NT, Microsoft Office and a few Microsoft utilities. I paid real money for these products. That qualifies me as a customer. "/>
			<outline text="As a customer, as I watch Microsoft flail, I want more choices, not fewer. They are wreckless with my opinion. They insult my intelligence. They make me either stupid or compromise my integrity. I can't overlook that or accept it."/>
			<outline text="***I'm a developer"/>
			<outline text="As a Windows developer I like working with Microsoft people, we're involved in a serious project with them, and I think the people we work with know that I place very high value on the relationship. "/>
			<outline text="But if I didn't say anything, my integrity would be as compromised as the integrity of the CEOs who stood up with Gates, and the people who participated in the Microsoft-sponsored polls, and the value of my business, no matter how much money I make, would be zero; because without integrity my life is meaningless."/>
			<outline text="***Hope"/>
			<outline text="I might lose business opportunities because I say what I say. So be it. But I continue to have great hopes for Microsoft and for Bill Gates. With his resources, his intelligence, his drive, he could be a great leader. But he is not now leading us anywhere anyone with a mind would want to go. "/>
			<outline text="That's why I want to know what Microsoft stands for. Let's begin there. Does the vision have integrity? Is there a greater purpose? An end that justifies the means? Has Gates thought it through? My opinion is that he has not. "/>
			<outline text="If he had something he really wanted to do that the rest of us could support, he wouldn't resort to insulting and dishonest appeals for our support. Instead he would share the vision, it would turn us on, and we'd beg the government to get out of the way and let Microsoft deliver the vision."/>
			<outline text="***Contradiction"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft makes the best argument for breaking our reliance on them. At last week's staged rally speaker after speaker said that the economy could be headed for a downturn if Windows 98 were delayed. I doubt it, but let's assume it's true, or at least that Gates would like it to be true."/>
			<outline text="It's unacceptable that any one company have the power to hold our economy hostage. They drew a comparison to General Motors. But GM has competition. If they skip a model year, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, go on and on, all these companies would fill the gap."/>
			<outline text="If Bill Gates took a year off, who would be able to fill the gap? Does Microsoft fully control the hardware OEMs? Yes, I think they do. Could I compete with Microsoft? Not the way they have it set up now. They are competition-proof, and this is not a good place for the rest of us."/>
			<outline text="***Conclusions"/>
			<outline text="Those of us outside Microsoft have two choices, we can take the high road, or we can look to governments to break up and regulate Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="The first road will be a hard one. Do most of Microsoft's largest customers have integrity? I wonder about that. Do they care about their long-term viability if they depend on a single vendor for their system and application software? I like that approach better. It's not smart to look to one vendor to provide all the software you use. Will the economy make an adjustment, provide a zig to Microsoft's zag? I doubt it, because as Microsoft gets stronger and stronger, the incentives against competitors grow more and more daunting."/>
			<outline text="I am not a government interventionist. Like Gates, I think the government understands very little about software, I think even the senators, judges and attorneys would admit that. But if Gates wants my support, he has to start communicating responsibly, and stop asking us to support an easy path towards continued growth and profit for his company. I think they should have to work harder. It should never get easy for them. "/>
			<outline text="If they don't want the government to interfere, they should open the door for other software developers to interfere. It seems he just doesn't want interference. That's weak. I wouldn't support it even if I weren't in a position to compete, but I am a competitor, and I want my software and users have a chance."/>
			<outline text="I'd like to see Gates and his company take it up the butt, to pay a price for my support, that price being a high-road solution to the problems that the government is justifiably concerned about, and that every intelligent software customer, developer and hardware OEM must also be concerned about."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/18/98; 9:34:01 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A quick response to the government press conference that just completed in Washington."/>
			<outline text="They're looking at the web browser, seeking a preliminary injunction offering Microsoft the choice of unbundling MSIE or also including Netscape and one other browser. Knowing the history, I see the government as tilting the table in Netscape's favor as unnecessary and unfair. From my point of view, Netscape is a very large company, leveling the playing field is great, but tilting it in favor of a large company that set the terms of competition with Microsoft is not an acceptable solution."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, the government says that Microsoft's presence and business practices limit innovation. I think there's no doubt that this is true. When they look at application software they will see that it used to be a vibrant and diverse market, and the practice of bundling suites of applications first wiped out diversity, and then concentrated market share in Microsoft's suite."/>

			<outline text="Now where was I? "/>
			<outline text="I was on my way to Maine on Thursday when Microsoft delayed the intro of Windows 98 and started negotiating with the government. "/>
			<outline text="By the time I got back to California, the negotiations had collapsed and the shipment and presumably the lawsuit are back on. "/>
			<outline text="We should hear all about this later today."/>
			<outline text="***What they said"/>
			<outline text="According to Microsoft, the conversation went like this: &quot;Bundle Netscape!&quot; said the government. &quot;No way,&quot; says Bill, &quot;that would be like asking Coke to bundle Pepsi.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I look at it this way, even though Microsoft bundles a browser with Windows, more than half the net still uses Netscape. It's surprising that the government thinks that Microsoft's bundling will wipe out Netscape. It didn't happen for AOL last time around, when the faceoff was MSN versus AOL, and it didn't happen when MSIE was bundled with Windows 95. Look to history for a guide. "/>
			<outline text="Getting that kind of concession from Microsoft won't sit well with the rest of the software industry. I want to bundle too! So if Microsoft has to bundle Netscape, can I have some space? Why not? You'll get companies deliberately trying to get rolled over by Microsoft if that's the key to broad distribution. This isn't an economy I care to be part of."/>
			<outline text="The government has a lot of power, nuclear weapons and armies. They can twist the arm of India (please!) but do they know how to twist Uncle Bill's arm? Please stop worrying so much about the desktop icons, that's small stuff. Let's get some real concessions. We could restructure the software industry. Netscape is causing a lot of its own problems. To support them isn't in anyone's interest, unless you own Netscape shares."/>
			<outline text="We're entering a historic period for the software industry. I'll be tuning in as best as I can, but before that starts, I want to talk about Maine and broadband and a little Seinfeld and Sinatra."/>
			<outline text="***Seinfeld and Sinatra"/>
			<outline text="I never really liked the Seinfeld show that much. I do like self-referential New York Jewish humor. But I like it better when it's about me. Yeah. "/>
			<outline text="So in a way thank god for taking Sinatra on the day after Seinfeld's closing act. Friday morning was emotionally pleasing! All that great Sinatra music on TV instead of drippy remembrances of something that hasn't been gone long enough be nostalgic about. "/>
			<outline text="Sinatra, what a sad beautiful man. He was a believer, friend of Sammy and Dean and Joey, and lots of other people from my parents' generation. It was the backdrop music for my youth, it was going out while I was coming in. Sinatra was pop before the Beatles, but he also developed an art, performing with some of the greats of his day including Ella Fitzgerald."/>
			<outline text="And he did something not many white American men in his generation did, he opened his heart. The Sinatra man had ups and downs, fell hard, and had broken hearts. He was brave and fun-loving and took big risks, and was also vulnerable and introspective. "/>
			<outline text="He said &quot;Being jilted is one of life's most painful experiences. It takes a long time to heal a broken heart. It's happened to all of us and never gets any easier. I understand, however, that playing one of my albums can help.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Frank Sinatra was an imperfect man. We need more imperfect men willing to show us the way. Thanks dude."/>
			<outline text="***Maine"/>
			<outline text="Maine was cooool. I got there in time for Seinfeld and Sinatra, heard Apple's Avie Tevanian give the morning keynote at the Maine Software Developer Association (he's a hometown boy) and in the afternoon I gave the closing keynote. We talked about the usual stuff that software people like to talk about, Microsoft and Java, with some new twists. It was a good crowd. I had fun!"/>
			<outline text="http://www.mesda.com/ "/>
			<outline text="They have a small web and software community in Maine, and they want more. Portland is a really nice town. I drank beer, we debated, met people who were happy for the nice weather we were having. It's cold in winter, Mainers like that, but they also seemed to enjoy late spring beer-drinking weather."/>
			<outline text="***Broadband and community"/>
			<outline text="Portland could probably support a larger web development community because it's got one thing most towns, including San Francisco and Boston, don't have, a broadband cable system with an operator, Time-Warner, that wants to develop it as a web system."/>
			<outline text="http://www.maine.rr.com/ "/>
			<outline text="Community means something different in Maine. In Califoria, we think of virtual communities, like DaveNet or Scripting News, or any number of other special interests that transcend geographic barriers."/>
			<outline text="In Maine, the communities have names like Portland, Camden, and Bangor. They're real cities, not virtual. And it gets really interesting when the cable that connects the towns is ultra-high-bandwidth. How much bandwidth? Broadband systems perform at rates comparable to local area networks, but they cover much larger areas. Computers that are connected via broadband can communicate among themselves much faster than they can with other nodes on the Internet."/>
			<outline text="So I came back with a thinking project. What would you do with a very fast full-time net connection in a broadband geographic community? I had two ideas. Personal radio stations and automated backups."/>
			<outline text="***Automated backups"/>
			<outline text="OK, assume you have a high-speed fulltime net connection. Backups can be easy now? Yes, they can. A community invests in a single really secure redundant storage system, and every night at 2AM all the files that changed are uploaded to the server, with encryption so only you can access the information stored in the files. A local broadband network makes this realistic."/>
			<outline text="***Personal radio stations"/>
			<outline text="I wake up on Sunday morning playing an eclectic mix of bluegrass music and Sinatra and I think that a couple of my friends would really like it too. So I send them an email containing a URL that connects them to my CD player. When I play a tune they hear it too. They can send in requests, via email of course."/>
			<outline text="By the way, Time-Warner is doing the same thing in Albany, Columbus, El Paso, Honolulu, Memphis, Northeast Ohio, San Diego, in the southern tier of New York and Tampa Bay."/>
			<outline text="Do you live in one of those cities? What ideas do you have? What do you want to do with broadband?"/>

			<outline text="Looking for my angle as I wrote this morning, I saw three. "/>
			<outline text="A triangle, with Gates, Netscape and government at each of the corners, with the Internet, a cloud, containing the triangle."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape"/>
			<outline text="First some history. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape started rising in 1994, then plug-ins took off, and all of a sudden the money people of Silicon Valley got the idea that the browser could be an operating system, another try at PenPoint and OpenDoc, and with Java they could go all the way to the metal, they didn't need Windows or the Mac OS. Netscape could *be* an OS."/>
			<outline text="Netscape's leaders spoke publicly of dismantling Microsoft's operating system monopoly. They attacked Gates at the core of his business. He responded as we would expect him to. And Netscape didn't follow thru, the operating system they promised was never delivered. "/>
			<outline text="There were lots of ways they could have delivered, but they didn't. You can't blame Microsoft for Netscape's failure. Netscape had money, people, acquisition opportunities, great press. They just didn't execute."/>
			<outline text="Now Netscape needs management and direction. Quick fixes like bundling with Windows won't help. Netscape just needs to dig in and get serious. "/>
			<outline text="***Independent developers"/>
			<outline text="Focus on this. There are independent developers. Like me. "/>
			<outline text="What does that mean? I am a Mac developer, but I am not an Apple developer. I'm a Windows developer, but not a Microsoft developer. Similarly, I'm a web developer, but not a Netscape developer. If I wrote Java code, I'd be a Java developer, but not a Sun developer."/>
			<outline text="The independence of developers is what the Internet is about. It repositioned the operating system platform vendors as makers of web clients and servers and tool-running systems. And it gave developers an opportunity to be independent of operating system vendors."/>
			<outline text="Dave Nagel's Apple saw the web as a bad idea, and tried to develop OpenDoc as a higher level networking platform. They overestimated their influence with developers, overplayed their hand, and OpenDoc was withdrawn, a failure."/>
			<outline text="The Internet also repositioned Microsoft, but they resisted. Their approach was to suck the Internet thru Windows. Viewed another way, they were more realistic and less ambitious than Apple. They tried to build the best Internet OS, and they did that. It's hard to argue otherwise, really."/>
			<outline text="***Mired in history"/>
			<outline text="Web browsers are not leading edge in 1998. If history is any guide, they are not going to change from this point on, any more than spreadsheets have changed since the first one shipped in 1980. I'll eat my hat if web browsers work substantially differently in ten years. "/>
			<outline text="This is the first big cost we're paying as an industry for government involvement. They're focusing the cursor back four years instead of putting the focus on what we can do in the future."/>
			<outline text="***What can we do?"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I wrote about Maine and Time-Warner's RoadRunner online system. "/>
			<outline text="An amazing coincidence: the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Microsoft is negotiating a $400 million investment in RoadRunner, in competition with Oracle and Intel. It really gets my thinking flowing. Look at all the money that wants to get in. But where will the software come from? From big companies? Why not from independent developers?"/>
			<outline text="Think about broadband networks. What an incredible new market! What a vacuum. Distributed computing for the home and office. Who can mine this new field? It's going to take a market like the one that started the three incarnations of the personal computer industry -- the first rush in the early 80s, the graphic transition in the late 80s and early 90s, and the web boom of the mid 90s."/>
			<outline text="As I said in earlier pieces, Microsoft's best option is a vision that truly excites users and developers, with Microsoft playing a limited role. I urge Microsoft to undermine the government's case, appeal to developers at a level of huge empowerment, so much power that trust isn't an issue. The money and ideas will flow. Never mind the past battles in web browsers. "/>
			<outline text="***Gates"/>
			<outline text="The world is listening to Bill Gates as it never has before. He has never had an opportunity to lead like this, no one has in our lifetimes. IBM and AT&amp;T didn't have visible personal leaders like Gates. "/>
			<outline text="Watching Gates on TV yesterday, I saw a flustered, exhausted, confused man. This is right! It's real, not staged. It was like watching Sinatra sing on TV on Friday. But Gates is still alive. Now, what will rise from behind all that? We'll find out how ambitious he really is."/>

			<outline text="***An amateur talent show"/>
			<outline text="Hey man, do you sit on the sidelines while everyone is dancing? If you dance, do you notice that some people have fun while others feel uncomfortable?"/>
			<outline text="I could dance when I was a kid. Somewhere inbetween then and a few years ago I lost the ability to dance without worrying that I was looking silly. And of course worrying about that makes you look even sillier, and it spirals round and round, and it's not fun."/>
			<outline text="Then one evening, quite surprisingly, I saw a fat naked woman dancing at an amateur talent show. I had to look. She was good! Her big fat body had the rhythm of the music. Her huge breasts swung to the beat. A big funky happy smile on her face! It made the point. If a big fat naked woman can dance so beautifully in public, what do I have to worry about?"/>
			<outline text="Hey it's quite the opposite way. The sillier your body looks the more fun you have dancing! The dance is about the smile on your face. That's all it's about. What better way to have fun than to laugh at the funky body you have? That's why a fat naked chick dancing in public can have so much fun. And that's how she taught me the secret to dancing."/>
			<outline text="***Dancing tutorial"/>
			<outline text="So now I'm dancing as I write this, but I'm wearing clothes, don't worry. I think I can write a little dancing tutorial. The trick is to get the beat of the music to flow thru whatever you're doing. It helps if the music you're listening to has a beat that's hard to miss. The Neville Brothers certainly qualify. It's even better if it has a *funky* beat, because that puts the smile on your face right away. The funkiness *is* the smile... Get it?"/>
			<outline text="OK. So as the music starts up, I hope it's loud enough but not toooo loud, let your body start moving, don't worry at all about dancing to the music. Just start moving. Let your arms jangle. Do something silly. Need an idea? Move your hands in front of your face. Put your palms up and massage the underside an invisible plate in front of you. Bounce up and down with your hands moving in this stupid way. Then do it your own most stupid way. Roll your eyes back inside your head. Sing along. Laugh! That's the key to dancing. It's your thing. Do what you want to do! It's the rhythm that's in you. That's the first thing to know. There's no right way to dance, no right set of steps. It's you man. It's you woman. "/>
			<outline text="Now you're moving! Start paying attention to the music. See if you can get some of it to flow thru your body. Bounce up when the music bounces up. Let it down when the beat comes down. Do it again. Now start walking. Let your left hip lead you and bend backwards as you step. Now let your right hip lead. Go somewhere. Smile. Shout loudly. Wooo hooo! Shout something stupid. Make eye contact with someone. Bounce your bounce, but dig their's too. Do you get in synch? No? That's OK! Smile, laugh. Bounce somewhere else. Do it again."/>

			<outline text="Hey babe, I'm still listening to Pocky Way this morning, but there's more serious stuff to talk about, but I'll try to stick to the pocky rhythm and keep it light-hearted, even though the subject is heavy."/>
			<outline text="***The New York Times on software"/>
			<outline text="I read in Sunday's New York Times about economists thinking of different ways to restructure the software industry by restructuring Microsoft. Reading their comments I got the feeling, several times, that they don't get how software works. It made me feel nauseous. "/>
			<outline text="On Monday, Denise Caruso cites a SRI paper specifying how Microsoft should be broken up. And today Mitch Kapor piles on, talking about hypocrisy in the software industry."/>
			<outline text="***Web Energy"/>
			<outline text="While we're busy rewriting history, I think many people forget the mood in 1995 and 1996, it was euphoric, the old ways were on the way out, the web and its energy were going to rewrite the rules of the old software business. Out with the old, in with the new, Microsoft is encircled! Right on."/>
			<outline text="I called this Web Energy. Bright eyes. A lovely zig to the old industry's zag. The standards of the Internet really did undermine the standards of the old industry. Let's have fun! "/>
			<outline text="***The Microsoft attack"/>
			<outline text="I was against the Microsoft attack on Netscape and Sun because it caught the new Internet developers in the crossfire. I wanted Microsoft to be a leader, not an attacker. Give a new industry a chance to form. "/>
			<outline text="I felt sure that Netscape and Sun would collapse all on their own because they were building on the old industry model, much like Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="I wanted something other than a bigger and stronger Microsoft to be left standing when the war was over."/>
			<outline text="***Venture capitalists"/>
			<outline text="Kapor and others complain that the venture capitalists didn't fund word processors and spreadsheets. "/>
			<outline text="They blame Microsoft for this, but why not blame the VCs? "/>
			<outline text="So much money was flowing, why didn't someone fund a new word processor or spreadsheet? "/>
			<outline text="Where were the contrarian bets? "/>
			<outline text="Now deep software that runs on both clients and servers that can stand alongside Microsoft software has more value than they thought it would. "/>
			<outline text="The standards of the boom, HTTP, HTML, SMTP still have a lot of room for growth. And C is still a great, very popular, development language."/>
			<outline text="Que sera sera! The future's not ours to see. "/>
			<outline text="Hah!"/>
			<outline text="***The Netscape wound"/>
			<outline text="Anyway the near-failure of Netscape is a huge wound, not just for their shareholders and employees, for the whole software industry and that includes Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="How do I know it's such a big wound? Because we're talking about Microsoft and not about wonderful new things we can and want to do. "/>
			<outline text="The Netscape wound is totally hogging the idea space. And it's going to get worse before it gets better, unless Bill Gates takes power and changes the subject in a decisive way. He's the only one who can do it."/>
			<outline text="***Look for the magic"/>
			<outline text="Here's the deal..."/>
			<outline text="The magic behind Netscape and Java was worth embracing."/>
			<outline text="When Microsoft attacked, they also attacked the developer communities."/>
			<outline text="This was their mistake, I believe."/>
			<outline text="Instead of listening to McNealy, Andreessen and Ellison, they could have listened to the developers behind them. What did they want? Was it a threat to Microsoft? "/>
			<outline text="Someone who commands headlines has to go first and find real win-wins for developers. Move the cursor over there and keep it there. It could have been Sun or Netscape, but it didn't turn out that way. "/>
			<outline text="Trust this, web energy is different from the energy at Microsoft. Same with Java. It's young energy. They can blow our minds like we blew the minds of the minicomputer generation. But we have to let them make headlines with their ideas. Get out of their way. You can't tell the press what to cover. So let's stop giving them opportunities to make the past the issue of today."/>

			<outline text="***I want music"/>
			<outline text="I know what I'm looking for. Music. I need something to fill in the gaps in the battle between the network giants, Microsoft and the government."/>
			<outline text="It's been three years since I started writing to music, but the state of the art of music distribution on the web has hardly changed in the three years. It's certainly easier to buy audio CDs on the web, but where is the distribution system that takes advantage of the music programming capabilities of my personal computer? And I have a server. I am a DJ. I really want to do that. Really!"/>
			<outline text="The music industry doesn't know what it wants to do. Could it get started while they figure it out? Yes, it already has."/>
			<outline text="***An Afterlife for The Dead?"/>
			<outline text="Jerry Garcia is gone and The Grateful Dead isn't performing anymore. But they left behind a wonderful legacy, all those bootleg tapes, as far as I know legally produced, that were begging to be put up in RealAudio, LiquidAudio, NetShow or QuickTime, or whatever. "/>

			<outline text="Right on."/>
			<outline text="***The bootleg bootstrap"/>
			<outline text="It can be commercial too. Writers, programmers and musicians working together. We could have fun! Let music sneak into writing on the web. And I think we could make money."/>
			<outline text="Charge five cents per play for each song, $5 for an unlimited personal use download. $50 per broadcast. The player checks in with a license server to be sure the user has the right to play the song. "/>
			<outline text="With broadband networks and DSL, high power net connections become a market. We can have more powerful security systems to protect the value of intellectual property. "/>
			<outline text="***Seduction is required"/>
			<outline text="Trusted endorsements and emotional appeals. I think we could have sold a lot of listens to Hey Pocky Way last week. And people would have been happier for it! That's the kind of flow I want to develop. An economy of sharing. That's how the money flows. How much would you pay for a smile? $5 is nothing."/>
			<outline text="Start with stuff that's not in distribution now. I'd happily pay $5 for Buddy Miles's Changes. Great dance music. I'd even pay $5 for the Grateful Dead studio version of Hey Pocky Way, if it exists."/>
			<outline text="We know one band that will go for this for sure, The Dead. The open source of the music world. So we get to play with their stuff. It'll open the way for other tunes to flow thru the net. Yah yah."/>
			<outline text="***Video rentals on the web?"/>
			<outline text="Another idea. I want to rent videos using the web. How would it work? In my web browser, go to www.videorentals.com. Look up the movie I want. Add it to my shopping basket. Check out. Three days later the video arrives in my mailbox. I have a week to watch it. Then send it back in the pre-paid mailer. No trip to the video store. "/>
			<outline text="I can plan my movie watching for the next year. I can go thru a whole series of works by a specific director or actor, in any order I want. I can watch movies with the same rhythm that I browse the web. It'll happen for sure. "/>
			<outline text="***The lesson of the web"/>
			<outline text="I think it's about niche distribution for now. Gaining distribution for creativity that isn't being broadly carried in the old distribution system."/>
			<outline text="Where the cost of production is already paid for, where the audience isn't concentrated geographically. "/>
			<outline text="Users require seduction, but the owners of intellectual property need to be seduced too. A toe dip with the old stuff will lead the way to new stuff that takes the new medium into account."/>

			<outline text="A short Saturday morning DaveNet with a neat idea that I bet will become a hit. "/>
			<outline text="I first posted the idea on Scripting News on Thursday, and yesterday, one day later, there was an announcement on infoworld.com that Netscape is going to implement it."/>
			<outline text="I think we're onto something. Yeah! I like it."/>
			<outline text="***Domain Name Servers "/>
			<outline text="First a little background. "/>
			<outline text="When you type www.scripting.com into your web browser it sends a message to a piece of software running on another machine called a domain name server. The DNS software turns the string into a set of four numbers, 206.204.24.4. "/>
			<outline text="Even though it's virtually invisible, the domain name server is an essential piece of software. When you're browing or emailing, your software does a lot of DNS lookups."/>
			<outline text="***Try an experiment"/>
			<outline text="Type 206.204.24.4 into the URL spot in your web browser. "/>
			<outline text="It should take you to the same place as www.scripting.com. "/>
			<outline text="You just did by hand what the DNS software does for you automatically."/>
			<outline text="***Smarter browsers"/>
			<outline text="A couple of years ago web browsers got a bit smarter, they allowed you to type in a word, the browser would take a guess, then try another, until it found a match, or if it didn't find one, it would display an error dialog. First it would try the string you typed, then it would add a .com at the end, if that failed, add a www. at the beginning. Then try .edu and .org and .net. "/>
			<outline text="This softness in URLs was great because you type less and because you have to remember less. But it is really crude, and led to the inevitable question, could it be made even simpler and more useful? And the answer is, of course, yes! "/>
			<outline text="***AOL keywords"/>
			<outline text="The answer is over a fence, in America Online's service, an AOL feature that hasn't made it to the general Internet yet."/>
			<outline text="AOL places are not places on the Internet, so if you type FOOD into the keyword dialog you get to the AOL place where you get food. Or if you type CHESS you go to an area where people play chess. You can bring up a list of all the places you can go. "/>
			<outline text="It's simple, the keywords are easy to remember and unambiguous. And even better for AOL, they're enormously profitable. An example, the company that bought the FOOD keyword, CyberMeals, paid $20 million for the connection. And the users get simplicity (and food). "/>
			<outline text="OK, you've probably already figured it out by now. AOL-style keywords are coming to the Internet. Here's how."/>
			<outline text="***A new level of DNS"/>
			<outline text="Not too deep in a control panel on your system is a pointer to the machine your software sends DNS requests to. You'll change that number to the number of a machine running at Netscape or Yahoo or Microsoft or Oracle or Compaq, or whoever grabs the top of this hill and wins the hearts of Internet users."/>
			<outline text="This one little connection will allow you to use a new set of keywords in all parts of your Internet use. The people who operate the server will be able to charge the FOOD people millions of dollars. And you'll get the same benefit that AOL users have been getting, simple names for places you can buy things."/>
			<outline text="I'm not sure how well I've explained it but using it will be a lot simpler than understanding how it works. "/>
			<outline text="***Netscape's advantage"/>
			<outline text="Now here's a piece of brilliance."/>
			<outline text="According to the InfoWorld story, Netscape is going to bake a similar feature into the next release of Navigator.  "/>
			<outline text="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980529.winetcenter.htm "/>
			<outline text="I'm going to guess how it works. Launch the new Navigator, type FOOD. Instead of going to your normal DNS, the browser talks to a server running on the Netscape campus. It looks up FOOD in its keyword dictionary, sees that CyberMeals owns the keyword (assuming they made the deal with them, as they did with AOL) and directs the browser to the CyberMeals server at 207.149.235.10."/>
			<outline text="That's it. Every month they can sell another keyword. The users are going to love it. They've leveraged their position in web browsers to grab a big piece of e-commerce. Bravo!"/>

			<outline text="Good morning and welcome to June!"/>
			<outline text="Where I'm from it's starting to get hot, it's more fun outdoors than in. July is right around the corner and then another month of heat, August. Whew! Looking forward to it. For kids June means the end of school, and possibly more opportunities to make trouble. Same here! "/>
			<outline text="For me June means a fresh start. I'm looking for ways to get rid of things that are holding me back. That means saying goodbye to old ways. I have a feeling that it's a good time to gain new perspectives, if I can pop up a couple of levels I'll see opportunity everywhere."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape"/>
			<outline text="Look at how well it's working for Netscape! "/>
			<outline text="They are recasting themselves as a marketing and operations company, not as much of a development company. They are linking services and software. It's a winning formula. Netscape should continue to look for ways to leverage their browser installed base in network services and e-commerce. If they really get this, buy their stock. "/>
			<outline text="In the meantime people at Netscape have trouble listening to me, as Steve Jobs at Apple does. They don't get it, if I say they're blowing it in one area, that doesn't mean that I think they're blowing it everywhere; or if I say they're blowing it in May, that doesn't mean I can't change my mind in June. And I never think my opinion is the only valid one. Public commentary is good for everyone. If they listen it can help them get their message out, or correct mistakes more quickly."/>
			<outline text="If only the industry people would deal in a long-term way, they would have less to complain about when they get coverage they don't like. With the channels open everyone can grow. It's about relationships. The Netscape people I've been in touch with either sulk or get enraged when I say I don't like what they do. They cut and run, which means to me, they're only listening to people who say things they like."/>
			<outline text="Look at Microsoft. I blast them and they keep the conversation going. Last week I said &quot;I have great plans for Microsoft,&quot; in a phone conversation with a Microsoft exec and he says he likes that. Even I was surprised. "/>
			<outline text="I also have great plans for Netscape. But Marc Andreessen doesn't like it. I want to help. I admit I to saying it awkwardly. The answer that came back was an unmistakable blow off. Of course I keep plugging away. "/>
			<outline text="That's why my motto is Still Diggin!"/>
			<outline text="***Barry Goldwater"/>
			<outline text="Barry Goldwater, who died last week, is not digging any more."/>
			<outline text="He wanted to run against Kennedy, his friend, in 1964. They were going to rent a jet and travel across the country, debating in the style of Lincoln and Douglas. You can be sure it would have been elevating. Instead he ran against Lyndon Johnson, and was painted an extremist, a cause he helped, because he admitted to being an extremist. I remember the TV ads. A mushroom cloud and a simple question, do you want Goldwater's finger on the button? I guess most people didn't because Johnson won in a landslide."/>
			<outline text="Goldwater was a conservative. I was raised to think that conservatives are unrealistic and weak. Can't handle the future? That's what I was taught to think of conservatives. But watching Goldwater's 1964 GOP convention acceptance speech on C-Span, I realized that his conservativism was different, it was positive and courageous. He wanted to return to the charter of the United States, the foundation of free speech and limited government. The United States of Thomas Jefferson was a great thing! Very innovative for its time. A good place to look for core values."/>
			<outline text="Goldwater was a team player, up to a point. When his line of integrity was crossed, he didn't go easily. He said his fellow Republican, Richard Nixon was the most dishonest person he had ever met. Goldwater was the conservative leader who eventually went for abortion rights and gays in the military. He said &quot;All I care about is that they can shoot straight.&quot; Right on Barry."/>
			<outline text="***Recasting"/>
			<outline text="Well, unlike Goldwater, I'm still alive and I'm still diggin!"/>
			<outline text="Frontier has a been a long ten-year road, with lots of changes along the way. First it was commercial, then we gave up and freed it in 1995. Then we discovered a killer app for Frontier in 1996, I reinvested, we ported to Windows with the intent of creating a commercial product. "/>
			<outline text="Now it's time to begin another transition, either we'll succeed and have a well-financed development and operations company, or we'll put Frontier in mothballs, and revisit it next year. So the stakes are high for us. It's shit or get off the pot time here at UserLand. Wheee!"/>
			<outline text="***Mail lists"/>
			<outline text="In our old model, support was centered around a sprawling set of mail lists, where people would ask questions and get answers. But there was more and more discussion of our direction, and a broad focus across all features of the product, as we've been trying to narrow the focus to areas where our software has a unique and valuable contribution to make."/>
			<outline text="This created a conflict for us, and made it more difficult for us to move. Now we have to take some big steps, take some risks, so as of today UserLand is no longer hosting mail lists for Frontier users. "/>
			<outline text="We'll happily point to Frontier-related mail lists sponsored by other people or groups. This is the norm in the software business. Independent discussions on independently hosted lists. No one is forced to participate."/>
			<outline text="***Let's invent, inspire, empower and inform"/>
			<outline text="And with this move comes the opportunity to invent new ways to communicate. As long as the mail lists were operating there was less room (or need) for people to innovate. "/>
			<outline text="Let's use the web better, set up systems that encourage people to think before they click the Send button, and make it easy to revise their writing later after they see how other people respond."/>
			<outline text="I feel it's more appropriate for individuals to invest in a personal website for promoting their opinions. After all, Frontier is a great website management system! Maybe we can do *all* the communicating we need to do on the web, which is a more thoughtful medium than email?  We'll see. We've created the space for that to happen. "/>
			<outline text="I hope that the people who use Frontier will accept the challenge and fill the space with innovative new groupware."/>
			<outline text="***June 30"/>
			<outline text="By June 30 we'll have a plan for turning Frontier users into customers. Please don't ask how it will work, give us some time to get organized. If we fail we will go on sabbatical, get some new perspectives, and possibly start over in early 1999."/>
			<outline text="Now I hope that people on our mail lists understand why we turned them off. We're going to change now. We don't want to waste June debating with people. We have decisions to make, and have a right to make them unilaterally and without getting consensus, just as the people who use our products do. The mail lists made it difficult for us to move and that's why we stopped hosting them."/>
			<outline text="***Our focus"/>
			<outline text="I'll write more about what we're doing with Frontier in the next few weeks."/>
			<outline text="First, I wanted to cross this line, let it sink in, and go the next few steps."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;XML Parsers&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/4/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="A brief DaveNet following a discussion on the general XML mail list."/>
			<outline text="http://listserv.hea.ie/lists/xml-l.html "/>
			<outline text="It's an interesting list, and getting more interesting now that two of the biggest names in XML, Eve Maler and Tim Bray, are actively participating in the discussion. "/>
			<outline text="***Who am I?"/>
			<outline text="I've never introduced myself to the leading developers in the XML world. I'd like to fix that! "/>
			<outline text="First, I'm a web developer, I manage several home pages, and about 30,000 sub-pages, on my site. And I make tools for other web developers, with many more home pages and sub-pages. "/>
			<outline text="***What XML means to me"/>
			<outline text="I see XML as a way of adding structure to the web. I dig structure, it's my friend. It allows me to set things up so with one command I can take plain content and make it look beautiful. "/>
			<outline text="I like to change something in one place and have the change percolate everywhere, like a spreadsheet allows recalculation for numbers, I can recalculate the presentation of stories and information. Extending that way of doing things to XML is a natural thing, we're totally ready for this."/>
			<outline text="Today we generate HTML and live with its limits. If XML happens, with all that it promises, including vector graphics, it could revolutionize our world, if the standards are strong and if developers have real choices."/>
			<outline text="We're also using XML to build higher-level networked systems that are easy for web developers to understand and extend. The XML is actually invisible, but it's discoverable. To me, that's the essence of the web. There's a View Source command, you can lift the hood and replace any software or run it on any operating system, as long as you generate and understand the same tagged text and support the basic communication protocol of the Internet, HTTP."/>
			<outline text="So to me, the value of XML is structure, simplicity, discoverability and new power thru compatibility. This is where it has the power to be as big a force as HTML, maybe even bigger, but to do so it must avoid the problems that were not avoided in the evolution of HTML."/>
			<outline text="***The mess in HTML browsers"/>
			<outline text="There are two big HTML parsers, the one in Netscape Navigator and the one in Microsoft Internet Explorer. You have to check to see how each of these programs displays the stuff you're producing. The parser is at the center of how well each browser works, or doesn't. You may find that one browser displays a page perfectly and the other one mangles it. "/>
			<outline text="Getting a site ready to ship is a negotiation process, a least common denominator workaround of the problems with one browser in ways that don't break the other one. It's not a nice world to develop in. You waste a lot of time and always settle for non-optimal HTML."/>
			<outline text="But that's how web developers work. The only validators that count are Navigator and Internet Explorer.  "/>
			<outline text="***XML parsers"/>
			<outline text="Every program that understands XML must also have a parser. The parser takes tagged text and compiles it into a structure that software, written in C, Java or a scripting language, can walk thru and operate on in some way. It's the quality of these parsers that determines whether the XML standard will be stronger than HTML."/>
			<outline text="Surely some parsers will be more popular than the others. Microsoft's XML parser, for example, will presumably be baked into all their products, from servers, to databases, content development tools and browsers. Their parser will be pretty close to ubiquitous. They may rightly feel that they define the real-world, least common subset of XML. "/>
			<outline text="Another parser is available from James Clark, a longtime SGML developer. Like the Microsoft parser, Clark's is available to be included in other software. And it's likely to be popular since it's the one that Netscape is including in the next release of Navigator."/>
			<outline text="At UserLand we've written our own XML parser, we had to because Microsoft's isn't available in source code, and Clark's parser wasn't complete when we needed it earlier this year. We couldn't wait because we wanted to deploy a remote procedure calling protocol built on XML. It's part of the next release of Frontier, and we're already routinely building applications on top of it."/>
			<outline text="What will other developers do? Some will use one of the publicly available parsers, and some will cook their own. Even inside large companies I've seen developers use more than one XML parser strategy, and different source code, for different products."/>
			<outline text="***The genie's almost out"/>
			<outline text="How will we know that each of the parsers can understand what other software understands? The answer is disturbing -- unless we, as an industry, take some steps now, there will be no guarantee. That means XML will head down the same path as CORBA and HTML, with compatibility expressed in terms of products instead of standards. "/>
			<outline text="Once the genie is out of the bottle it's impossible to put it back. Surely Microsoft and Netscape could invest the engineering resources to straighten out their HTML parsers now. But if they did, it would break all the pages that have been coded to work around their errors. It's the usual software thing, bugs turn into features, unless you catch them at the beginning."/>
			<outline text="XML is at its beginning, there's very little content, and there's a simple solution to the problem, but the solution must be implemented with people, not software or standards."/>
			<outline text="***Rating and testing the parsers"/>
			<outline text="We need an independent and objective rating service that tests each of the XML parsers as they become available. "/>
			<outline text="Each parser is run thru a set of tests. Does the parser catch the errors? How clear are the error messages? Another set of tests explore the fringes of XML, the parts of XML that many parsers are not handling, or are not handling correctly. Examples of these areas include attributes and namespaces."/>
			<outline text="We should also have standardized performance testing as we do with other kinds of software. Assuming a parser is correct, how fast is it compared to other parsers? If I have a choice between Clark's parser or Microsoft's, which is faster and uses memory more efficiently? That's how every developer will make their decision on whether to use an existing parser or create their own. "/>
			<outline text="Another rating, what does the programming interface look like? Does it implement an understandable callback structure? Does it generate an easy-to-navigate in memory tree? What languages can you use to walk the structure?"/>
			<outline text="***A publishing company could do it"/>
			<outline text="One of the publishing companies, Ziff-Davis, IDG or CMP come to mind, could very inexpensively buy itself a strong position in the development of XML as a standard by establishing such a rating service, publish the results as a website that's kept current, and also (of course) make the results available in XML so we can write agents that keep track of the competition. It would be a fun way to start using XML, right now, no chicken and egg here."/>

			<outline text="It would be great to see a common suite of tests that they run against XML parsers."/>
			<outline text="***Grounding"/>
			<outline text="XML, as it is currently evolving, is missing real-world grounding. "/>
			<outline text="If XML doesn't gain traction it isn't a problem, but incompatibility between different tools could be enough to stop it from gaining traction. "/>
			<outline text="So an independent testing and evaluation service is a central, and missing, part of the XML world."/>

			<outline text="Hello readers! Happy Friday."/>
			<outline text="I've been busy working on the commercial release of Frontier. We're going forward. Learning a lot. Having fun, and struggling. But we're going to get there. Lots of new ideas. Coming sooooon. As they say, don't touch that dial."/>
			<outline text="On a walk yesterday I pieced something together, I was thinking about politics, I want to tell the story, and then get back to work on my programming. "/>
			<outline text="***They're not stupid"/>
			<outline text="I often assume that the government is stupid. If only they understood how the net and the software world work, they'd wise up and get out of the way. "/>
			<outline text="But what if I'm making the wrong assumption. What if they fully understand what they're doing? What if they're not stupid? What could they be trying to do?"/>
			<outline text="Sloppily, I assume the FBI is stupid in wanting to keep US software companies, like Microsoft, from building authentication and encryption into every incoming and outgoing net connection. But what if the FBI isn't stupid? What could they trying to accomplish?"/>
			<outline text="***1/1/00"/>
			<outline text="Why is the government focusing the attention on Bill Gates, yet at the same time, setting us up for an economic collapse on 1/1/00? "/>
			<outline text="Don't we need the software industry totally focused on avoiding this? It's weird, we know it's coming, we know *when* it's coming, but we're not doing anything about it. "/>
			<outline text="***Change is here"/>
			<outline text="Indonesia's revolution last month was organized on the Internet. The US software economy can empower the people of China if they can communicate without government interference. "/>
			<outline text="It's been proven, the net can topple political systems. The change isn't coming, it's here. And it allies all the governments of the world. If the people are allowed to organize, things change. It's the haves versus the have-nots. The historical human battle."/>
			<outline text="Now it's a very dangerous game. Nuclear weaponry is coming into the open, and people are talking, in more realistic terms, about the probability of a nuclear war. Asia is falling into depression. Japan, a huge economy, with no nuclear capability, is getting vulnerable. And Greenspan says the US economy is great. "/>
			<outline text="***Using the Internet against us"/>
			<outline text="It's an insane world, and you can see it play out in the new politics of the software industry. "/>
			<outline text="Part of our industry is run, today, from Washington DC. If something doesn't change, soon, it's going to be totally run from Washington. If 1/1/00 comes and we lose it all, even if just for a short time, and without millions of people dying, the public may call for the nationalization of computer networks, and the governments will be happy to do it."/>
			<outline text="I think that's where we're going. One-world government. The power of the Internet controlled. All they have to do is hold back privacy software for a couple of years while they let it play out."/>
			<outline text="***Hobbling Gates"/>
			<outline text="In this light, the government lawsuit against Microsoft looks very different. They have to knock Gates off his perch. He's the biggest possible fly in the ointment. He has enough money, employees, millions of developers, and most importantly, he's the most admired public figure in the world!"/>
			<outline text="Knock him off his perch. He could blow the whistle, and he'd be listened to."/>
			<outline text="Strategy: Give him an axe to grind. Of course he's against the government, just look at what they're doing to him. He's biased. "/>
			<outline text="***Fuel the browser wars"/>
			<outline text="The browser wars were quieting down, Netscape is getting to work recasting as a portal, it's going to work, and it was the right thing for them to do from day one. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape has an interest in net-based software distribution, it's the zig to Microsoft's distribution, which depends on having power over bits on virgin hard disks. "/>
			<outline text="Windows *is* an open system. You can build anything you want on top of it. So what if Microsoft owns the OEMs. Netscape should always have been shooting for ownership of net-based distribution."/>
			<outline text="The goverment's role in the old faceoff between Netscape and Microsoft is to keep it going. It's a distraction, a good tactic. Argue over what Microsoft can and can't put into their operating system. Make the argument about something irrelevant like whose bits get to render HTML on the client. "/>
			<outline text="The real issue is what kind of privacy, authentication and encryption tools we get, and when we get them. The US government wants to own that. They kill two birds with one stone in the suit against Microsoft, they discredit Gates and distract us from our power. "/>
			<outline text="There's an HTML browser in Windows. Get over it. Netscape is going to be fine. Let's focus on privacy software. Does it belong in the OS? You bet it does. "/>
			<outline text="***I want power"/>
			<outline text="If we can communicate with security we can be even more powerful. That's why the politicians want to control our access to privacy. The government wants to operate a virtual server that captures our email whenever they want to. They keep an archive, just in case they ever want to take you to court. "/>
			<outline text="We got a look at the Microsoft execs' email. How would you feel if we got a look at *your* email? It could happen. You might be famous, overnight, and not be cast in a very good light."/>
			<outline text="I want companies whose sites I use and trust to know more about me. I've already tried this with amazon.com. They know a lot about me. They keep sending me emails recommending books I might like, and they've usually been right on. I want more of this, but I want to control who gets what. "/>
			<outline text="I don't want my bank to know what my reading habits are. And I sure don't want Amazon to know my bank balance. I need control, you do too. (By the way, I also need to be able to view the information companies are keeping about me.)"/>
			<outline text="I want to write an agent script that loops over all the nodes it can find looking for someone with a garden in New England that I can visit this summer. Or a piece of software that I wish someone would make. "/>
			<outline text="Or to help me find other people who want to work with me to make the world a safer and better place thru free, private and secure speech."/>
			<outline text="In the new world, software power and political power are the same thing."/>
			<outline text="***1/1/00"/>
			<outline text="We have a date with history. "/>
			<outline text="1/1/00. 568 days from now. That's going to be a big day, bet on it. What's going to happen? Will computer technology shine on that day, or will it cause a world economic collapse or nuclear apocalypse? "/>

			<outline text="Hey babe, a quick one, it's the middle of the night in California, all the other websites are quiet, but I had a few thoughts this evening on the drive back from San Francisco, wanted to get them down, then out, and then hit the sack."/>
			<outline text="***Timely stories"/>
			<outline text="In 1948 George Orwell wrote a book about 1984. It wasn't a very positive vision. When I was growing up, the year 1984 loomed large. When it finally came, it wasn't actually very much like the book, although some hippies thought it was."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, in the early 80s I had the foresight to think of writing a book about 1948, making fun of the 40s, and ship it in 1984. I didn't write the book, no one else did either. No one even did a movie remake of Orwell's book. A bunch of missed opportunities."/>
			<outline text="***My conspiracy piece"/>
			<outline text="I got lots of email about my first conspiracy theory piece, entitled &quot;1/1/00&quot;. You can read the best stuff on the mail page:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/mail/mail980612.html "/>
			<outline text="One comment stuck with me, from James Knight, jknight@ai.mit.edu. He said &quot;Wow, talk about conspiracy theory. I hope you're going to see the X-Files so you can confirm all your ideas about mass destruction of the world. Maybe you could even join them in their quest to Fight The Future.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***A movie?"/>
			<outline text="Cawabunga! In Knight's comment is the germ of a great idea. I'd be very happy to sell the piece to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.x-files.com/&quot;&gt;X-Files&lt;/a&gt;, I think it would make a fun episode, but I think it would make an even better movie."/>
			<outline text="The title of the movie would be Y2K. A disaster movie on the scale of Godzilla or The Titanic, or all the new meteor and comet movies. There probably wouldn't be any monsters or aliens. But there would be geeks and presidents and spies, nuclear intrigue and people with PowerBooks (or Dell laptops?) saving the planet. "/>
			<outline text="Saddam Hussein would have a copy of PGP. A beautiful blonde Israeli intelligence officer and her best friend, a Japanese web developer, with seven systems and a pager who wears a suit and tie in his bedroom, like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wienerworld.com/bluesbro.htm&quot;&gt;Blues Brother&lt;/a&gt;. They'd be on the net using a Director simulation of what chat will look like in Y2K. There's the love angle. Like John and Yoko, but turned around and net-based. They'd lose contact at the crucial moment, and the movie would end with the world safe and them in love."/>
			<outline text="And don't forget the grizzled street-savvy managing editor covering the White House, and&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.filmkauai.com/cafe/RickSmolan/&quot;&gt; Rick Smolan&lt;/a&gt; with photographers scattered all over the world doing photo-essays of the infrustructure collapse.

			<outline text="If people want competition with Microsoft, they have to take into account all possibilities. In my opinion, the problem isn't with the OEMs, it's in the limited imagination of the opinion leaders of the software world. "/>
			<outline text="Now Nader, apparently, wants to be one of those people. Too bad we don't get the benefit of a fresh perspective, he's taking the low road. Instead of cutting down Windows, how about boosting the alternatives?"/>
			<outline text="I choose to make this about the Macintosh. I have something at stake here. Largely due to these limited imaginations, I now use a Windows machine, and at great expense in time and money, our software now works on Windows, as well as the Mac."/>

			<outline text="Here we go!"/>
			<outline text="***Changes"/>
			<outline text="Can you see a change here? There is one. Not just in what I'm doing, but in how it's happening. I want to tell the story of how I got to this place."/>
			<outline text="In early May I had an incredible healing experience. It wasn't deliberate, it happened by accident. I went to a weekend gathering of friends at the massage school I went to four years ago. People came and went over the 48 hours. "/>
			<outline text="On Saturday night there was a birthday party for me, about fifty people were there. It was an incredible experience, a concert, dancing, lots of talking and touching. A circle of adults with open hearts, behaving much as kids do when they're happy and on their best behavior. "/>
			<outline text="On Sunday the group of adult-kids sat in a circle and we told our stories. I played the role of interviewer, a role I often seem to take. I asked direct questions. Then came tension, which erupted into an intense shouting match. I went into a trance! This is just like it was when I was growing up. "/>
			<outline text="I rely on logic and facts, from my point of view, of course. And people use illogic to corner me. It's very frustrating! Only this time I'm not a helpless kid, I've got the experience and confidence that comes from being a 43-year old man."/>
			<outline text="It got worse and worse. Everyone seems to be against me! Oh man. It's just like a flamewar on a mail list. I threatened to leave if they didn't start acting respectfully. Then something happened that showed me how to resolve the repeating loop in my life."/>
			<outline text="***A strange feeling!"/>
			<outline text="The two people who had been arguing with me most intensely, a man and a woman, did something that I had been waiting for 35+ years for. They embraced me in a huge hug. I let my head go inside this warm dark mixed space and sobbed and cried and let it out, breathing, tears flowing freely down my face. "/>
			<outline text="When I emerged I felt more relaxed and confident than I have in my entire life. "/>
			<outline text="What a strange feeling!"/>
			<outline text="***A shock"/>
			<outline text="I then went outside and one of the more distant people, a man named Miles who hadn't spoken in the group, came out and said something that took me to a whole other place. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;You're the most loved person in the room,&quot; he said. "/>
			<outline text="I was shocked! I thought exactly the opposite was true. I let the idea settle in and realized he was right.  Then, on the drive home, I looked at everything I do, and realized that I work really hard to be that."/>
			<outline text="***Taking care"/>
			<outline text="This caused a fundamental change in my view of the world and my role in it. It's very simple. Instead of looking to the world to give me its love, and paying the price, I can give myself the embrace I need and let the world take care of itself."/>
			<outline text="That may sound cruel, but I'm just one person. I can't hold up the world, not even a small part of it. The best I can do is take care of myself. I can't do more than that. "/>
			<outline text="***What this means"/>
			<outline text="In my public writing it means I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/05/heyPockyWay.html&quot;&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; my own way, and if some people have a problem and flame me, that's OK. "/>
			<outline text="And in software it means that I can insist that my team to do what I want them to do. And in business it means that users can pay money for my software and be even more satisfied with the results."/>
			<outline text="The irony of the first couple of months of this new regime is that people seem to love me even more! Go figure. (I'm not complaining.)"/>
			<outline text="***Getting ready, again"/>
			<outline text="Shortly after the early May weekend I met with my team and told them that I would stop writing checks to support UserLand at the end of June. I had to go thru a lot of fear to do this, but it was a great feeling for me, because it meant that by July I would be free again. I was ready for that!"/>
			<outline text="But my team surprised me and at the same time frustrated me. Now, with this new time limit, they got hot, especially Bob Bierman. It was an amazing transformation."/>
			<outline text="I hired Bob in late 1996, and he worked with Doug Baron thru 1997 to get the Windows version of Frontier ready. But I had already worked with Bob, in the mid-80s we did a project together that in many ways was the most successful software shipment I have ever done, a product called Ready! It shot to the top of the charts in record time, largely due to Bierman's brilliance and drive."/>
			<outline text="But the work relationship at UserLand wasn't going that way. I thought Bob had gotten old, had burned out. He was still doing good work, but it wasn't the magic collaboration that I remembered."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, after telling the team about my decision, I went for a walk and they went to lunch. They came back with a plan to take Frontier commercial. I groaned! Oh man, I was going to go on vacation. Sheesh."/>
			<outline text="There were a lot more steps in this process, which I don't have time to write up now. More lessons, Bierman drives the process, the same story was being repeated in lots of other places, more changes needed. UserLand wants what I want, to find a new happy place in the world."/>
			<outline text="Now we're about ready to release the commercial version of Frontier. You'll see a different attitude. A new Dave and a new UserLand. But all the old ideas were right too. We're ready to do a new kind of software company. You'll see."/>

			<outline text="Good morning DaveNet!"/>
			<outline text="This is the week we take the wraps off the first commercial release of Frontier since 1993. Five years inbetween, a major turn to the standards of the Internet, we aim at a different market, web-based businesses, and instead of competing with platform vendors, we're aiming at a market that's currently defined by Vignette StoryServer and Inso Dynabase and technology ideas pioneered by Telescript and Java."/>
			<outline text="***Change!"/>
			<outline text="Lots of change is happening and most of my keyboard time is being spent communicating with customers. Not much time to write a DaveNet. I wish I could because I'm learning so much! I wish I could share it all. When the dust settles, I hope to be able to do that. Very exciting times here at UserLand."/>
			<outline text="On Friday we sent an email to registered Frontier users outlining the new program. It's subscription-based and three-tiered. We're asking for more money than many people thought we would. This touched off a heated discussion on the Frontier community mail list. We waited to respond until most of the opinions were out. Then we changed some aspects of our pricing. We want our users to turn into customers. But we also want UserLand to be a good investment vehicle. "/>
			<outline text="***A ten year ride"/>
			<outline text="Our eye is on the big prize. We think Frontier 5.1, the new release, with new performance, reliability and compatibility; new HTTP client and server capabilities; market-leading XML support; and breakthrough net-based RPC technology; is the development environment that Telescript wanted to be and that Java will someday be. I know those are bold statements but I believe they're true. "/>
			<outline text="It's been a ten-year ride, and now I feel that Frontier is ready to take its place alongside the classics of the software world, not just as a widely-used web development system, but as a leader in a new class of applications that build on the Internet as if it were a complete development platform."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/29/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning and happy Monday!"/>
			<outline text="We have an all-day meeting today so I don't have much time to write, and it's been a week since I've done a DaveNet piece, and I want to get some ideas out there, things continue to move fast, and I'm still learning a lot, and happy with the transition of Frontier to being a commercial product."/>
			<outline text="Before going on, I want to address a pair of concerns. On one side, a single DaveNet reader who I won't name has said that the last piece was too close to being a commercial for his comfort. Even one person saying this requires a public response as far as I'm concerned. "/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is my personal journal. I don't run anything in this column unless I think it's interesting. That's the sole criteria. I use this column to promote ideas, evangelize directions I think are important, and to talk about where we're taking our products."/>
			<outline text="Even when Frontier wasn't commercial, the moment it was my intention to take it commercial, I made a public statement in DaveNet. So my response is that there hasn't been a change, and since DaveNet is free, if it isn't something you're comfortable with, then you can unsubscribe and the problem is solved. This may sound harsh, but the lines have to be clear in order for me to be comfortable that everyone knows where I'm coming from. Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***The other side"/>
			<outline text="On the other side, a lot of Frontier users read DaveNet. Some of them, more than one, have expressed discomfort that I approach human issues in a colorful way in this column. I understand that it's unusual for a company president to write a column, but it's not unprecedented. "/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates writes a column that's syndicated by the New York Times, and Jim Barksdale and Marc Andreessen write columns on Netscape's website. Stewart Alsop and Bill Gurley, both venture capitalists, write columns for Fortune magazine. It's becoming more common for companies to expose the thinking of their executives in a public way."/>
			<outline text="To the Frontier customers who are uncomfortable with DaveNet, you absolutely do not have to share my values in order to use our products. Let's value diversity, in software and in human beings. The only values I bring to and expect from a customer relationship are mutual respect and professionalism. Everything else is subject to discussion and differing opinions."/>
			<outline text="I also think it's a positive thing to put a human face on the management of a software company. Companies are totally about people, yet so many deny that, pretending that they make their decisions without bias or passion. But... what's the point of having technology if it isn't to serve people? "/>
			<outline text="So this tiny little window into the soul of a president of a company, while unusual, isn't really revealing anything. The top guy at this company is human. I make mistakes, I take chances, I say what I think and I change my mind. I think that actually helps the software move faster, because I learn from every piece I write, both from doing the writing, and from what comes back; and what I learn goes into the software."/>
			<outline text="So, think of DaveNet as joined with Frontier, but separate from it. If you want to understand our strategy, it's a good idea to read this stuff. I've been pretty open about my thinking, and I want to stay that way, even if our company grows to be the size of Oracle or Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="Further, I think the values of DaveNet, you know, still diggin, let's have fun and namaste y'all, make a lot of sense in the context of a company that's making money. So let's do it, let's have fun, and tell the truth whenever possible, and go from there, and see where it takes us."/>
			<outline text="***A slice of a conversation"/>
			<outline text="A little over a week ago, we announced the new pricing and support structure for Frontier 5.1, the commercial release that we had been planning for so long. "/>
			<outline text="Since then, I've been communicating on a regular basis with the members of the Script Meridian community list, an independent group of Frontier developers."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scriptmeridian.org/projects/lists/community.html "/>
			<outline text="At first it was intense, and then we got down to work. Before saying anything else, a hearty thank you to all the people on the Script Meridian list who are working with us patiently on the new pricing and support system."/>
			<outline text="I've thought about posting my emails on Scripting News and DaveNet, but have wanted to keep the conversation limited to the group of people on the list. But on Sunday morning I wrote an essay to the list that I want to share with DaveNet readers."/>
			<outline text="The email was in response to a message from Scott Lawton of Prefab Software, encouraging us to run a survey asking users to commit to purchasing Frontier at a lower price than the ones we have listed. It rambles thru lots of issues, the changes in the Mac market, the scripting business (or lack of business), Steve Jobs, and the press. I thought it was interesting enough to share with DaveNet readers."/>
			<outline text="***Here's the email (lightly edited)"/>
			<outline text="Scott, first, thanks for putting the effort in here. I think I have to clarify what our goals are for UserLand. We want to build revenue so we can grow and be a successful and powerful company. High-end cross-platform web content systems is our business. "/>
			<outline text="Emphatically, we don't want to compete with Dreamweaver, NetObjects Fusion or GoLive Cyberstudio. Those are great tools for designers. We make a back-end system for managing content. We want to interface with those products, not enter their market. "/>
			<outline text="In our view, the market is divided four ways. Writers, designers, graphics people and systems people. Dreamweaver, Fusion and Cyberstudio are the best tools for designers. Frontier is for systems people. It's the glue that can connect all their work together. We have more to do in this area, and we will do it. But only if we can focus on this area. "/>
			<outline text="Some of the records in our registration database are from people who chose Frontier over other products because it was free. That was OK up to a point, but that line is crossed. The people who were just dipping their toe into Frontier now have to take a look at what's available elsewhere, decide if it fits their needs, and if the other stuff works for them, and is less expensive, I think they'll be happier, and I think we will too. "/>
			<outline text="It's not that we don't like them, it's just that we can't serve them directly as customers. We *can* serve them as a back-end rendering and distribution system, if they want to manage content as part of a group, but not as their primary interface for content development. When they look at our product and our price and they see it isn't a fit, they can and should look elsewhere to see if they can get a better deal. And that's correct and feels right to me."/>
			<outline text="We think we can build a successful business working with people who really need the power and depth of a content management system. In other words, I'd much rather work with people who want to store 20,000 pages in their object database and leave the smaller site-management tasks to tools that are better suited to it."/>
			<outline text="***Was Steve right?"/>
			<outline text="Please let go of the idea of Frontier as a free or inexpensive scripting environment for the Mac OS. I had to do it, you do it too. It's gone, it's over, finished. "/>
			<outline text="Just like Steve Jobs cancelling OpenDoc, Newton, the clones, or making his deal with Microsoft. Was Jobs right in doing these things? I think he was! Apple was unfocused. The only way for a company to grow and make sense to its customers is if they know what they are and what they aren't. "/>
			<outline text="I didn't really start letting go until 1996. Even then, as some have pointed out, I still wanted to show people how cool Frontier/Finder is. Read the DaveNets thru late 1997. I was still struggling to get Apple to help us build a market. It's a hard one to let go of. Even in the last round of technological innovation in Frontier, the XML-RPC stuff, I tried to get Apple in the loop, privately and awkwardly, and it didn't work. "/>
			<outline text="And to show how stubborn I am, I still have hopes that when Jobs sees the role Frontier will play in the industry, he will want to tap into our flow, that the best way to bridge Apple Events over the Internet will be with Frontier as a hub. But that's still a few months away, and I hope we'll be well established in our role as a content management system by then."/>
			<outline text="***We're restructuring"/>
			<outline text="If you go back and read my first paragraph, you'll understand what's going on here. We are structuring our company so that it's an attractive investment. It very much matters who is buying our product and for what purpose and at what pricepoint."/>
			<outline text="Frontier as a Mac-only system-scripting environment was heavily financially subsidized. It lost a lot of money. You don't know that a lower price would actually work, and honestly, I don't believe it would. You can't convince me it's a goldmine. It could be that you're right, but in business, you have to make a decision, and I've made mine. "/>
			<outline text="***Puzzling"/>
			<outline text="That said, I'm puzzling out some way to get a deal for the people who make up the community. For people who have released scripts and samples and tutorials that other people use, or who have participated in our mail lists in a positive helpful way for newbies, and are willing to do so in the future. "/>
			<outline text="I'm having trouble coming up with criteria for this. I can't cannibalize our high-end sales. I'm working all the time on this idea, and am not comfortable with that, because we have fires to put out elsewhere. "/>
			<outline text="Next week is going to be a major formative week for the new UserLand, and I have to be focused on those issues, and at some time I'd like to get back to writing software and working with tools developers on realizing the potential of XML-RPC."/>
			<outline text="***An idea"/>
			<outline text="One idea I've been toying with is an official status for a handful of people, something like &quot;Support Associate&quot;. These people, perhaps up to 20, check the support mail list on a daily basis, research questions that people ask, provide sample code, submit articles and bug reports to the support database, in general implement support for the product, as part of the team. I'm looking for a creative solution that keeps the community people in the loop, even if they can't afford to buy in on the commercial or even the personal license."/>
			<outline text="Major disclaimer: this is not a commitment to do this. I want to explore the idea, and seek input from the people on this list. "/>
			<outline text="My goal is to preserve and then grow the energy and intelligence of this community, not dissipate it. I want people to have a mission, a purpose, to see their work recognized and appreciated, and (here's the new thing) give all of us a shot at making a good living doing this stuff."/>
			<outline text="***MacWEEK, MacAddict support our change"/>
			<outline text="Another observation. MacWEEK was ready to support our change. For the first time, they've accepted that we cast Frontier as a web content system, and they're telling the story as we tell it. This is a major milestone. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.zdnet.com/macweek/1224-0627/nw_frontier.html "/>
			<outline text="MacAddict also posted a piece, again, consistent with our positioning and explaining the feature set as we present it."/>
			<outline text="http://www.macaddict.com/releases/9806/frontier.html "/>
			<outline text="***Why now?"/>
			<outline text="Why can it happen now and it couldn't have happened earlier? I think there are two reasons. First, we needed some time to make the transition. And second, Apple has forced the editors to rethink several times, with all the changes they've made. Now they're more flexible, if they can move with Apple, they can move with developers too. Apple set an important precedent, we finally got a little air cover, and it came in an unexpected way."/>
			<outline text="But who really cares why it can happen now? This is a good thing because with this flexibility we can move faster and products can position relative to our product, because we have definition. We're not everything to everybody. This is what we wanted! And this creates room for other people to play in the adjacent spaces. It helps us fit in. What a relief!"/>
			<outline text="So we may have a framework for communication, as we move Frontier forward, at least two publications will probably move with us. This is great! When we ship a refinement to Frontier, like a new groupware application (we have a couple of new ones almost ready to go), or if others ship a refinement, they're more likely to run the story, now that they have gone on the record supporting our new role. "/>
			<outline text="***Markets"/>
			<outline text="And that's what markets are about. "/>
			<outline text="Defined products that relate to others."/>
			<outline text="In software, relationships can be implemented with new connections. That's why interapplication communication, expressed first in the form of Apple Events, then as COM and CORBA, and now as XML-RPC, is such important technology."/>
			<outline text="As it has always been, the challenge is to create new connections between software products and platforms; to smoothe out the experience for users and give them new power. We want designers using Dreamweaver to work with graphics people using PhotoShop and writers using Eudora and everyone using a web browser like Navigator or Internet Explorer. You get the idea. Let's focus on people and making them more powerful. It's a big world out there. We can make it bigger by working together."/>
			<outline text="Hey vive la difference! I'm thankful that Frontier is not like Dreamweaver. That means we don't have to do what they do, and we don't have to do it all. "/>
			<outline text="It also means we can work together to build markets. It's more credible that way. "/>
			<outline text="That's always been my dream for the software industry, and it still is."/>
			<outline text="More diggin to do!"/>
			<outline text="Happily,"/>

		<outline text="Security Hole in Windows Web Servers" created="7/1/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="securityHoleInWindowsWebServers" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Security Hole in Windows Web Servers&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/1/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="There's a serious security hole in Windows as a web server platform."/>
			<outline text="If you run a Netscape or O'Reilly web server your LAN might be open to easy hacking. This was first reported on Saturday on News.com. And yesterday it was revealed that Java running on Windows has the same problem."/>
			<outline text="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,23747,00.html?st.ne.fd.mdh "/>
			<outline text="The vendors are moving too slowly. The Sun spokesperson blamed Microsoft, and also (wrongly!) pointed the finger at their users, saying it's bad practice to put passwords in scripts. But where are they *supposed* to put them? And even if it's bad style according to Sun, they're there and the customers are at risk, and why aren't moving more quickly?"/>
			<outline text="***Are you at risk?"/>
			<outline text="Your network is at risk if:&lt;ul&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;You're running a web server on a Windows machine. (This problem isn't there on the Mac OS or Unix, as far as I know.)"/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;You have .asp pages, or other kinds of scripts, on your site, in the directory that your website is served from."/>
			<outline text="&lt;li&gt;Those scripts contain passwords that open protected resources, like databases that contain credit card information, medical records or nuclear secrets."/>
			<outline text="&lt;/ul&gt;"/>
			<outline text="***The trick"/>
			<outline text="Here's the trick a hacker would use. "/>
			<outline text="Let's say the URL of a dynamic page on your site is:"/>
			<outline text="www.myCompany.com/logon.asp "/>
			<outline text="The hacker would enter this URL:"/>
			<outline text="www.myCompany.com/logon.asp.  "/>
			<outline text="Note the extra period at the end of the URL. This is enough to convince the web server that it's not an active server page. "/>
			<outline text="But you'd think the server would return a 404 Not Found error (it should) because the file with the trailing period doesn't exist. But the &quot;problem servers&quot; depend on the Windows file system to behave in a more sensible way (it doesn't). Windows strips off the trailing period, and returns the source code of the script, and the server sends the code out over the Internet. Ouch!"/>
			<outline text="By the way, it's not just .asp files that are vulnerable, the loophole can expose the source code of Perl scripts or server-side Java code, basically any script code that's stored in a file in the web server doctree."/>
			<outline text="***Shaky ground"/>
			<outline text="The source of the problem is so low-level that any Windows web server that doesn't work around the problem is open to the security hole."/>
			<outline text="O'Reilly and Sun are on shaky ground when they give the blame to Microsoft. One of the things web server software is supposed to offer is reasonably clear and understandable access controls to the system manager. There are two failures here, one belongs to Windows, for sure. And the other belongs to the server vendor."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, no matter who's to blame, the hacker gets your passwords, and may be able to use them to gain access to other resources. Assume the worst! It could be pretty bad."/>
			<outline text="***If I were Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="If I were Microsoft, I'd issue a broad public statement right now, warning Windows web server admin people to shut down their systems and review the contents of their site to be sure that they aren't broadcasting passwords to the outside world."/>
			<outline text="If I were a server vendor like Sun or O'Reilly, both of whom have publicly pointed the finger at Microsoft, I'd withdraw those statements, forget about blame, protect your customers, and get a fix out, right now, this morning. And let all your users know that if this ever happens again, the response will ship within hours not days."/>
			<outline text="This is serious stuff and it requires a serious response."/>
			<outline text="***A question for Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="The problem doesn't effect Microsoft's IIS web server because they closed the hole in February 1997. Now here's the question."/>
			<outline text="Was there adequate notice to the other server vendors when this hole was detected and closed in Microsoft's server?"/>
			<outline text="If not, remember that people who use other servers on Windows are also Microsoft customers and (another question) they deserve better, don't they?"/>
			<outline text="By the way, some people feel the fix should come in Windows, but I don't agree. Windows existed before web servers were popular and is used for lots of things that don't involve URL resolution. Who knows why Windows has this strange behavior? Maybe if they closed the hole it would break other software? Probably so. "/>
			<outline text="Some situations, like this one, transcend competition. It's in every vendor's interest to side with the customers here, put competitive issues aside, and work together to solve this problem quickly."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>

		<outline text="Web Servers and File Systems" created="7/2/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="webServersAndFileSystems" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Web Servers and File Systems&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/2/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I got a call from Jay Allard at Microsoft, he's the man responsible for their IIS web server. We had a long talk about how to handle security holes in their operating system, notification of other server vendors, etc. "/>
			<outline text="During the conversation, he teased me, saying that they had found another source code revealing hole in Windows. I asked for details and he declined, understandably, not wanting to offer the recipe until they had a defense in place."/>
			<outline text="Well, literally minutes after this conversation, a message started circulating on the net showing a new, very serious hole, in IIS, Allard's server, and I wonder if this is the one he was talking about."/>
			<outline text="***How it works"/>
			<outline text="Here's the recipe..."/>
			<outline text="Add a cryptic string at the end of a URL to a script-generated page. "/>
			<outline text="The cryptic string is ::$DATA."/>
			<outline text="So if you want the source code to Microsoft's home page:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.microsoft.com/default.asp::$DATA "/>
			<outline text="It works for Perl code too:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.activestate.com/lyris/lyris.pl::$DATA "/>
			<outline text="Does this trick work on your server too? I'd check it out if I were you!"/>
			<outline text="Note that as this hole becomes well-known, you may not actually get the source code with this trick. But as of 6:24AM Pacific on 7/2/98, you do."/>
			<outline text="***If you write a Windows server"/>
			<outline text="A message to people who write web server software. "/>
			<outline text="Don't depend on Microsoft to close the holes in Windows. You can and must do it for yourself. Roll up your sleeves and start coding. "/>
			<outline text="You have to parse the URL yourself, and as you do so, walk the directory structure, and don't do any of the fancy stuff Windows does at the file system level. "/>
			<outline text="We have source code that does this, we don't consider it proprietary, and we'll release it asap on the Scripting News home page. "/>
			<outline text="And don't dis the Windows file system yet, it's legacy piled on legacy. Yesterday's hole was inherited from CP/M, a 20-year old operating system. Who knows where today's hole comes from? And tomorrow's."/>
			<outline text="***Top level lesson"/>
			<outline text="At least on Windows, web servers and file systems are different things. Software has to take this into account."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Microsoft could add a new API to Windows, one that turns a URL into a file spec. But it's hard to imagine developers trusting this API anytime soon."/>
			</outline>
		<outline text="We're Not Prepared" created="7/3/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="wereNotPrepared" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;We're Not Prepared&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/3/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday was the highest-flow day ever on scripting.com, and rightly so. We had the most detailed information on the $DATA security hole in IIS and other Windows-based web server software. It was a breaking story, I believe a bigger story than the Intel Pentium public relations fiasco over two years ago."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's response was excellent, but the industry press response was frightening. This morning there's barely a mention of the story on the sites I check on a regular basis. I'm tempted to say that this was not the catastrophe that I'm concerned about, but it *was* the catastrophe, and there are certainly a lot of system operators that still aren't aware that they have a major security hole, and given the coverage given by the press, it seems they aren't likely to find out."/>
			<outline text="Even though dozens of reporters are on DaveNet, only one inquiry came in from a press person, and that inquiry was about the trust issue I mentioned in the postscript, which is a long-term issue largely of interest to web server developers, and shouldn't concern system managers and users much. "/>
			<outline text="Why weren't the reporters interested in this story? Is there any lesson I can learn from this? Maybe I'm not trusted? Maybe the press people don't get it? How can I do better to deserve their trust or to educate them about how precarious our security is, now that web servers manage sensitive information like customer credit card info, medical records, and nuclear secrets?"/>
			<outline text="***An open airline database"/>
			<outline text="My moment of greatest fear yesterday came when I got a link into a major airline's frequent flier database, and presumably I could have altered my records in their database (I'm a customer). "/>
			<outline text="As an experiment I tried calling their main number to see if they could receive a security alert over the phone, and found that they had a company policy to not give out phone numbers. I could make a reservation, but I couldn't speak with their computer operations people. I said it was an emergency. I asked to speak to their president, but the request was refused. "/>
			<outline text="How frightening for them! Airline safety is a big deal. Sure a hacker probably can't impact airline safety thru a frequent flier mileage database, but we don't know that that's the only hole that was opened yesterday."/>
			<outline text="And I saw the password they chose for their database and was even more shocked! Oh man. Passwords 101. Change that password right now folks. Even without the IIS hole, a hacker could easily guess the passwords that many people are using."/>
			<outline text="***Remember Murphy"/>
			<outline text="Further, since the hole has been there since IIS shipped, we have no idea what other data was compromised due to the hole that was revealed yesterday. "/>
			<outline text="Remembering Murphy's Law, anything that can go wrong will go wrong. It seems prudent to assume that your passwords are compromised, and go from there. "/>
			<outline text="***Are we prepared?"/>
			<outline text="We have an emergency response system for other kinds of catastrophes, earthquakes, fires, power outages, etc., but the response system for computer security holes is totally inadequate. It may take a meltdown to bring this home to the public, something that people can relate to, an event that costs everyone money or jobs, or kills people, or breaks a system that people depend on."/>
			<outline text="Then the press will be outraged, and the anger will likely be directed at computer industry, but it would be misplaced. This time the industry acted responsibly, but the press didn't pick up the story. There's still time, and something important that still needs to be done. The press is a crucial link in the communication system. People have a right and need to know about this stuff."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft shipped a fix for the problem yesterday. Now, system operators have to install the fix. The press can help by spreading the word, and perhaps for once tell the story of an industry that's doing its job in an honorable and open way. "/>
			<outline text="The bottom line, security holes happen. I don't believe people who say Unix or Mac systems aren't subject to holes. No one knows. Programmers are human, we make mistakes, software has bugs, and servers have holes. The measure of our quality is how open we are about our mistakes, when we take the high road and let people know, even if it makes us look human, we're doing the right thing. I hope the press tunes into this."/>

			<outline text="Good afternoon DaveNet!"/>
			<outline text="It's a great Wednesday. I'm feeling so good. Do I only write these emails when I feel great? No, not, no way, for sure. But these are my favorite times to write. I'm feeling so good this morning I just had to do a piece."/>
			<outline text="Stuff is flowing well in our product, company, and user community. It's been an interesting transition, moving from being a freeware company to being a commercial company. It's caused us to look at everything we do. Everything changes. Where there was no conflict before, now there is one. Where there was no synergy before (same idea, different spin) now there is synergy. "/>
			<outline text="But everything is connected, we're still the same people at UserLand, we still care about the same things, and we're closing loops that were opened in earlier DaveNets. "/>
			<outline text="Read on..."/>
			<outline text="***Netted RPC"/>
			<outline text="In Frontier 5.1, shipped a couple of weeks ago, we achieved an important milestone. We're the first to ship an XML-RPC communication system. See this DaveNet piece from February for background:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/02/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html "/>
			<outline text="The XML-RPC technology, new in February, is deployed in July. And we've been working privately with other companies on this, so our XML-RPC wires will be able to bridge to other systems, written in Java, Perl, C++, Tcl, Python, Rexx, Visual Basic, JavaScript, you name it; running on any OS that supports HTTP, which is everything. "/>
			<outline text="I think we played the technology game perfectly, and we also played the political game. Details sooon. Lots of BOGU. Do you know what that means? It feels soooo good!"/>
			<outline text="***DataChannel"/>
			<outline text="So yesterday I read an InfoWorld interview with David Pool, CEO of DataChannel, touting his WebBroker XML-RPC protocol."/>
			<outline text="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?/interviews/980629pool.htm"/>
			<outline text="He says he has no competition! Huh? "/>
			<outline text="He has competition. We're it. We may be his worst nightmare, with a 10-year R&amp;D advantage, deep experience with this stuff, and lots of users, and a full server-side content management system, and editorial tools, on Mac and NT. "/>
			<outline text="***Publish-to-the-web"/>
			<outline text="DataChannel is a good marketing company. They're pushing another idea that we implement in Frontier 5.1, they call it Publish-to-the-web; we call it the WebEdit client/server:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/howtos/webEdit.html "/>
			<outline text="It's the second killer feature in Frontier 5.1. I've been writing about this repeatedly in DaveNet. There are four kinds of people working on websites. Writers, designers, graphics and systems people. Writers need writing tools, word processors, email programs. Designers need layout tools like Netobjects Fusion, Dreamweaver, Cyberstudio, etc. Graphics people use PhotoShop, and systems people run servers that tie all this work together. "/>
			<outline text="WebEdit is a prototype for the kind of connections that writing and design tools should have with content management systems. A simple menu, with easy to understand commands that takes the contents of the frontmost window and ships it to the server, to be run thru templates and placed in the doctree of a web server. "/>
			<outline text="A workgroup problem that requires a workgroup solution. Why? Because websites are groupware."/>
			<outline text="Every market research firm covering the industry, from Seybold to Forrester is looking for the killer app in this area. My claim, my firm belief, is that Frontier 5.1 and its successors are that. We're the game to beat. I'm confident in the software. "/>
			<outline text="In the spirit of fair competition, I'd be happy to run a rebuttal from Pool, or someone else from DataChannel."/>
			<outline text="***The magic of Windows"/>
			<outline text="Porting to Windows was the best thing we ever did. Even though our Mac sales dwarf our Windows sales, so far, the Windows version of Frontier has been our ticket to respect. "/>
			<outline text="The press and analysts take us much more seriously, as do the other software developers. Our work in XML-RPC never would have gained momentum if we had been Mac-only. "/>
			<outline text="But the secret is that the Mac platform has a very loyal following, it's very active in web development. Our competitors bet on the Mac going away, and we bet the other way. I can say this openly because a reality distortion field protects my competitors from hearing what I say. Life sure is funny."/>
			<outline text="***Future directions"/>
			<outline text="We want to bet on Linux and Perl."/>
			<outline text="This may mean a Frontier for Linux, which would probably take a couple of years, or there may be a quicker connection possible, in the form of a runtime environment that easily hosts Frontier-managed sites. Super high-flow commercial sites require a powerful dynamic runtime. Frontier is not that runtime, yet, even on NT. Our server environment is great for content management applications. You can deploy a modest-volume dynamic site on a Frontier server, but if you're taking a million hits a day... "/>
			<outline text="If you want to run a Yahoo, Hotmail or Excite, Linux is the best choice. We hear this over and over from our customers. So a connection to a dynamic Linux server environment is ideal. We're going to study this, and would be happy to work with any group working on such software. It's good business for us and our customers."/>
			<outline text="To expand the market, which is not a problem right now, but something we'll want to address in the future, hosting Perl scripts is going to be a very important direction. There's a massive audience there. Lots of braincells grok Perl. We can add so much value, a great editing environment, an integrated object database that manages HTML and XML content, a comprehensive verb set, and connections to other software thru support for Apple Events, XML-RPC and (still diggin) COM. Perl and Frontier make huge sense together. "/>
			<outline text="We also have ideas in writing and organizing tools. This is an area we know well, based on our experience with ThinkTank and MORE in the 80s. In the four-group model, these products are aimed at writers, not systems people, as Frontier is. We see the industry ignoring these people, or fumbling. The first efforts in HTML editors were clumsy because HTML is not a wizzy medium. We can do better by approaching sites as structures and articles as text."/>
			<outline text="***Mixing voices"/>
			<outline text="In the new commercial environment I'm still working on the right mix of voices. When I talk with customers and potential customers, as the president of UserLand Software, I have a different voice. Here's an example."/>
			<outline text="http://www.userland.com/newsletter/issue1.html "/>
			<outline text="But when I write DaveNets, obviously I still am President Dave, but I'm also allowed to digress."/>
			<outline text="***President Dump Kitty"/>
			<outline text="Many years ago, when I ran a software company called Living Videotext, my picture appeared in Business Week along with a story about my company. Somehow it made it to my hippie uncle, living in Florida in a beach house on the edge of the intercoastal waterway near St. Augustine. "/>

			<outline text="Brent Simmons, brent@userland.com, downloaded Navigator 4.5 early today, installed it, and tried out their new &quot;Internet Keywords&quot; feature. "/>

			<outline text="This is a change from earlier versions of Navigator and Microsoft's web browser."/>
			<outline text="I've been emailing with people at Netscape about this today, and so far they've said that the behavior in other browsers, including their own, is an \&quot;undocumented geek feature&quot;. I disagree. Lots of people use the feature, not just geeks. It's easy. It's a shortcut. It goes thru Internic, the net's naming authority, instead of netscape.com, a private company. What if Microsoft did this too? "/>
			<outline text="The bottom-line for me is that they want to redirect flow from my site to theirs. People who go want to go to scripting.com will end up on netscape.com. Of course this only is a concern if Navigator 4.5 gains significant market share. So if I want to preserve the value of my domain name, I have to work against the adoption of Netscape's browser. I'm not saying I'll do that, but I sure am thinking about it."/>
			<outline text="I urge them to think this through. Do they need the money and headaches so much that they're willing to alienate people whose flow they're grabbing? "/>

		<outline text="XML-RPC for Newbies" created="7/14/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="xmlrpcForNewbies" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;XML-RPC for Newbies&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/14/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I sent you a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980710.whsoap.htm&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; to a story about Microsoft and XML-RPC, which according to Microsoft, is in the early stages of development. "/>
			<outline text="A quote from the piece: 'Microsoft officials said the XML-based protocol fits into its goal to interoperate with other platforms and vendors. &quot;We're committed to interoperate as never before,&quot; said Vic Gundotra, director of platform marketing at Microsoft.'"/>
			<outline text="Right on! It's taken fifteen years for this issue to rise to the top as an important agenda item for the software industry. I hope it stays right at the top until we get a solid Internet-based cross-platform remote procedure calling protocol. "/>
			<outline text="But first... What is it?"/>
			<outline text="***XML-RPC for Newbies"/>
			<outline text="Inside every computer, every time you click a key or the mouse, thousands of &quot;procedure calls&quot; are spawned, analyzing, computing and then acting on your gestures. "/>
			<outline text="For example, when you move your mouse over an icon, the computer calls a procedure, LocateMouse, to figure out what you're pointing at. "/>
			<outline text="Is the mouse pointing at a menu? At a scroll bar? If so, which part of the scroll bar? Is it pointing at an icon? Or some text? Every possibility is considered."/>
			<outline text="OK, so let's say the mouse is pointing at an icon when you click the mouse button. What kind of icon is it? If it's a printer, call the procedure that prints things. What do you do when the user clicks the mouse on this kind of icon? A special procedure answers that question."/>
			<outline text="This is the kind of chatter that's going on inside your computer *all the time*, even when you aren't there. It's always asking questions. And the answers come from procedures. To get an answer, the software &quot;calls&quot; the procedure."/>
			<outline text="***Parameters and returned values"/>
			<outline text="Along with the call, the procedure might require some extra information, so it doesn't have to recompute things that other procedures might have already figured out. These are called &quot;parameters&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="The LocateMouse procedure might need to be told where the mouse is. The location of the mouse is usually expressed in a coordinate system like the Cartesian plane that you learned about in high school. An x coordinate and a y coordinate. Such a procedure would be said to &quot;take&quot; two parameters, an x and a y."/>
			<outline text="Parameters are important for three reasons. First, why do the work again when the caller probably already knows where the mouse is? And second, the mouse may have moved in the time it took to call the LocateMouse procedure. And third, a procedure may be called to do some computation, for example, to look up a record in a database. Such a procedure would require a user's name or account number as a parameter, to identify the record that's to be looked up."/>
			<outline text="And there's the motivation for the third part of a procedure call -- the returned value. It's the answer that the procedure sends back to the procedure that called it. A database-access procedure call  might return a set of values, all the elements of the record indicated by the key identifier it received as a parameter."/>
			<outline text="***What is a procedure call?"/>
			<outline text="So, now we're ready to say, concisely, what a procedure call is."/>
			<outline text="A procedure call is the name of a procedure, its parameters, and the result it returns."/>
			<outline text="Why are procedure calls important? A very simple answer. Without them, there would be no computers!"/>
			<outline text="Every program is just a single procedure called main, every operating system has a main procedure called a kernel. There's a top level to every program that sits in a loop waiting for something to happen and then distributes control to a hierarchy of procedures that respond. This is at the heart of interactivity and networking, it's at the heart of software."/>
			<outline text="***What is RPC?"/>
			<outline text="RPC is a very simple extension to the procedure call idea, it says let's create connections between procedures that are running in different applications, or on different machines. "/>
			<outline text="Conceptually, there's no difference between a local procedure call and a remote one, but they are implemented differently, perform differently (RPC is much slower) and therefore are used for different things. "/>
			<outline text="Remote calls are &quot;marshalled&quot; into a format that can be understood on the other side of the connection. As long as two machines agree on a format, they can talk to each other. That's why Windows machines can be networked with other Windows machines, and Macs can talk to Macs, etc. The value in a standardized cross-platform approach for RPC is that it allows Unix machines to talk to Windows machines and vice versa."/>
			<outline text="***What is XML-RPC?"/>
			<outline text="There are an almost infinite number of formats possible. One possible format is XML, a new language that both humans and computers can read. XML-RPC uses XML as the marshalling format. It allows Macs to easily make procedure calls to software running on Windows machines and BeOS machines, as well as all flavors of Unix and Java, and IBM mainframes, and PDAs and sewing machines (they have computers in them too these days)."/>
			<outline text="With XML it's easy to see what it's doing, and it's also relatively easy to marshall the internal procedure call format into a remote format."/>
			<outline text="***Why RPC is important"/>
			<outline text="OK, now that we understand what XML-RPC is, let the XML part fade into the background. It's an implementation detail. Programmers are interested in XML, as are web developers, but if you're a user or an investor, XML is about as important as C++ or Java. The developers like it, or seem to, and that's the only major take-away from the XML part of XML-RPC."/>
			<outline text="But RPC is important, no matter what format is used, because it allows choices, you can replace a component with another one; and it opens possibilities, empowering advanced users to develop solutions with packaged software that the developers didn't anticipate."/>
			<outline text="***Choices"/>
			<outline text="For me, the trail goes back to the mid-80s when my company released an integrated product called MORE which was both an outliner and a presentation product. There was a lot of synergy in the integration, but a significant number of users just wanted the (new) presentation features without the outliner; and a significant number wanted the well established outlining features, and had no interest in presentation features. "/>
			<outline text="Both groups wanted a choice, they wanted us to separate the two pieces and connect them together. If someone wanted the outliner they wouldn't have to buy the presentation software and vice versa. But if they had both, you'd get all the integration features. It was a great idea! I've told this story many times. It was a turning point in my career. The users were asking for something reasonable, yet there were no operating system underpinnings to allow such a separation. "/>
			<outline text="A few years later, the needed technology was in the operating system, and we had built software, a database and scripting engine, around the technology. Application developers implemented interfaces that allowed our software to &quot;call&quot; them. We'd send some parameters to a procedure, implemented in another app, and the app would send back an answer. Every app that implemented this could now be viewed as a toolkit that an advanced user could build new applications thru. In this world, we could have done an outliner and a presentation program, and linked them together with &quot;glue&quot; scripts."/>
			<outline text="Choice is good for users, and for some developers, in some situations, it's not that good. So it was a mixed bag. In some cases, web servers for example, there were absolute standards that were adhered to. And in others, page layout programs for example, the &quot;wires&quot; were seen as a competitive advantage, and never got in synch."/>
			<outline text="***Possibilities"/>
			<outline text="Another advantage of RPC is that users may see opportunities for integration that developers don't understand, combining the features of two or more products. With the ability to glue apps together, an inspired user can do it. The developers may never understand or care what the users are doing, but it can happen anyway. Interfaces provide room for growth, open doors, allow a user-perspective to create new functionality. This vision says that users can be empowered to make integration choices without the support or help from software developers. "/>
			<outline text="This vision was realized in some areas. Databases and web sites are a hot area today, but all the pioneering work was done by users! How many database vendors understood the web when it first started booming? But flip the question around, how many web developers needed databases? Almost all of them figured it out."/>
			<outline text="Because there are standard interfaces for databases, the web people could do what they wanted, even though the database developers didn't have a clue what they were doing."/>
			<outline text="***Trade-offs"/>
			<outline text="As with all software technologies, there are trade-offs. When you integrate, when the procedure call is within the same app, you get much greater performance and more user-oriented features because it's easier to do a procedure call within a single app than it is to go outside of the app with a remote procedure call."/>
			<outline text="Apps will not disappear. In the early heady days of this sub-industry, some people thought they would. But there's too much momentum behind the idea of a process implementing internal procedure calls. So, long live the app! It's a good thing. It's still here, for a while at least."/>
			<outline text="***Back to Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="According to Jeff Walsh's InfoWorld article, Microsoft is planning to open up their operating system using XML-RPC. Such a protocol could be deployed quickly in other operating systems that support HTTP, ranging from Perl scripts running on Linux, to Quark publishing systems running on Macs, to relational databases running on mainframe systems. It could put Windows at the center of a new kind of web, one built of logic, storing objects and methods, not just pages and graphics."/>
			<outline text="As you know, I'm a big believer in this kind of glue. I've been talking with Bill Gates about this since 1985, when we met to talk about interapplication communication for MS-DOS. Then in 1991 we revisited the idea as Apple was deploying the Apple Event Manager on the Macintosh OS. Apple wasn't willing to license the technology, so Microsoft did COM. But COM mainly runs on Windows, and although there have been recent efforts to popularize it on other operating systems, it'll be an uphill battle because most operating systems have their own native way of connecting systems together at a remote procedure call level."/>
			<outline text="So, by agreeing, at least at a philosophic level, that XML-RPC is an important way to go, Microsoft is putting out a big Welcome Mat -- come rule our world, they say. You can control Windows without adopting COM. You can replace an NT machine with any other machine that supports the same interfaces."/>
			<outline text="Even if NT should become a locked-in standard in the enterprise (far from an accomplished feat at this time) users will be able to substitute other operating systems for NT thru simple interfaces. I support that, I think it's a winning strategy, because I know how much value customers place on choices and new possibilities."/>
			<outline text="It's the lesson that the Internet teaches. It's a lesson that Gates learned so well that he's upping the ante. Instead of a hodge-podge of different wire protocols and payload formats, let's get something in place that can quickly be widely deployed everywhere. Why wait? That's what Microsoft is asking."/>
			<outline text="There's no reason to wait. Let's get just-enough technology in place and then let a thousand flowers bloom. I absolutely don't care what the wire format is, as long as I can develop simple scripting interfaces on top of it. I give up control, everyone does, and we let the messy cacaphony of competition take over.  "/>
			<outline text="That's the way to go."/>

			<outline text="Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/07/xmlRpcForNewbies.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; was the result of a lot of hard work over a few months, explaining to business people and reporters, usually not successfully, why I was so excited about the idea of XML-RPC. "/>
			<outline text="Yesterday, after running the piece, I got a phone call from Dan Gillmor at the SJ Merc, breathless, excited, speaking in superlatives. I think Dan had a glimpse of something more that the Net could do for him. It's great when the loop closes!"/>
			<outline text="There were other similar phone conversations and emails yesterday. If it works, others will pick up the ball, and as more news happens in this area, hopefully the stories will be grounded in reality, not the Boy Kills Boy norm of the software industry. I hope!"/>
			<outline text="One writer asks what's the difference between CGIs and XML-RPC. Good question! At a basic level, there is no difference. CGI is a loose protocol for doing RPC over the net. But unlike the *promise* of XML-RPC, which is to have some organization to the flow of control over the net, CGI is so loose that no order can be imposed on it at this late stage. If XML-RPC doesn't have standard interfaces then it will be no more useful than CGIs. The hope is that it doesn't go that way. More hope!"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, now that the Newbies piece is done, my next piece, due by the end of next week, will be XML-RPC for Geeks. I'm going to work with Stewart Allen of WebMethods on this project. Their software and ours interoperate using the same XML-RPC protocol. We'll have more details, shortly."/>
			<outline text="Anyone else who wants to help, please let me know. We'll need reviewers, people to ask questions, so we can make sure the spec is a complete set of guidelines for implementing XML-RPC on other platforms, in other environments. "/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, a couple of short items that have nothing to do with XML-RPC..."/>
			<outline text="***Burn Rate"/>
			<outline text="I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684848813/002-2013145-7115223&quot;&gt;Burn Rate&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Wolff over the last few days. What a great book! I think it changed my life in the same way that Douglas Coupland's Microserfs did. As with Microserfs, I can easily put myself into his world. I've been there! In fact, I'm still there."/>
			<outline text="I thought it was just me who was bewildered by the incredible pace and lack of depth and substance in the online world. I'm surprised that Wolff and I never crossed paths, but his face is familiar, so I believe we must have met once or twice at some industry conference."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, after reading the book, I'm so captivated by the culture, now I want to be a VC just so I can experience the thrill of firing a CEO and replacing him with a &quot;factotum&quot;. Wolff expresses the same doubts that I have, can the net really be a literary medium, or does everyone just skim, looking for sensual bits, ignoring the subtlety of the writing? I like to believe at least *some* people read the stuff I write. Maybe no one does? Hmmm. Oh well. We'll see."/>
			<outline text="Burn Rate is an excellent read, a little depressing, but it's an exciting story because he burns his bridges so thoroughly and so dramatically. If you're professionally or personally involved in the Net business culture, for better or worse, I highly recommend it."/>
			<outline text="***An event-based medium"/>
			<outline text="My theory is that the Net, as a medium, gains and loses focus very quickly. When the DOJ takes Microsoft to court, or a security hole opens in IIS, lots of people zero in, looking for new info, experiencing the thrill of the real-timeness of the medium. "/>
			<outline text="Between the major events, chatrooms, game servers and porn sites are where the action is. The challenge is to get in tune with the flow, always be ready to drop everything and cover the hot story, get into the mania, and then let it subside quickly."/>
			<outline text="But some stories play out over many months, like this one..."/>
			<outline text="***A Y2K-safe bank?"/>
			<outline text="There are only 535 days remaining in this millennium. "/>
			<outline text="Do you know where your money is?"/>
			<outline text="Seriously, who doubts that there will be a financial crisis of some kind, before we cross the Y2K line? Do you think the press is finished with this one? I don't. Even if the banks are fully prepared, why haven't any of them started marketing their computers as being Y2K safe?"/>
			<outline text="It seems that the first bank to step up and proclaim Y2K-safeness will get the full benefit of the financial panic that's sure to come (soon!) as we get close to the line."/>
			<outline text="Here's a proposal. A leading bank or brokerage firm does extensive tests of their computers, simulating the changing of the century. Take out the glitches. Do it again. Take out more glitches. Do it again. Run the test in every conceivable way, and then put their stake in the ground, proclaim their systems to be Y2K-safe and make a guarantee. Publish the methodology so other banks can do the same. I bet Y2K-safeness will become a marketing issue for banks, and perhaps in other industries."/>
			<outline text="While we're on the topic, is there a good website that explains, in layman's terms, how an organization can start testing their systems for Y2K-safeness? Over the weekend I was asked this question by some relative newbies, and I didn't have a good answer. My first take was, tomorrow, set the clock on one of your computers to 12/31/99 and leave it turned on for a couple of days. What worked? What didn't?"/>
			<outline text="If you have other ideas or pointers, let me know..."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. It's a way of sending a procedure call over the net, with the returned result as HTML formatted text."/>
			<outline text="PPS: There's also a public relations opportunity for software companies who help banks get Y2K-safe. Think of it as an insurance policy against a backlash among consumers who want to believe that computers keep their money safe as opposed to putting it at risk."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Netscape and Generic Names&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/20/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Let's go back to the issues raised in &quot;Netscape's Undocumented Geek Feature&quot;, 7/15/98, and the articles on ZDNet, News.com and Wired that followed."/>
			<outline text="The Wired piece was especially interesting. It came out early this morning."/>
			<outline text="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/13820.html "/>
			<outline text="***Generic domain names"/>
			<outline text="Wired raises the issue, we've heard it before, whether anyone should own generic names such as scripting.com. I'm open to debate it. Right now UserLand does own the name, in every realistic sense of name ownership on the Net. Why? We had the prescience to know that it would be valuable, in March 1995, when we registered it."/>
			<outline text="I think we also developed the &quot;scripting&quot; term in the context of the Internet, unlike some generic name holders, who are holding the names waiting for the day when the names are worth millions. They may be disappointed if Netscape wins this argument, especially if Microsoft follows suit. Netscape's claim is that what's important is owning the browser bits on users' hard disks. "/>
			<outline text="We asked for and got a statement from Microsoft last week, and while they said they wouldn't implement such a feature at this time (smart move) they didn't say they would *never* implement it. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's Director of Windows Marketing, said: &quot;We considered and have thus far rejected ideas such as including a set of pre-defined URL mappings to keywords for the very reasons you list in your email. This is not something we believe can be done in such a way that benefits users nor is fair to the great many content providers that publish information on the Web. So contrary to Netscape's claim, we do not have this behavior in any version of Internet Explorer. Even if Netscape did not point to their own site, I still believe this functionality is problematic for users and content developers. How do you pick the one URL that gets a keyword like 'Car' or 'Developers' or in terms of trademark issues 'Ford' or 'Xerox' for example.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Mehdi makes a good point. There are lots of Fords. There's Gerald Ford, the former US president. And Harrison Ford, a famous movie actor. And the Ford Motor Company. And Ford County, Kansas. And Navigator is a Ford product, but it's also the name of a minor league baseball team and of a product from (ooops) Netscape. Which Ford gets the keyword, and how will the other Fords feel about that?"/>
			<outline text="Other owners of generic names, news.com comes to mind, have also done a lot of development of their brand/domain name. I consider news.com to be authoritative in the area of computer industry news. As with scripting.com, they cover only a slice of their generic category. Surely the New York Times would have a better claim on the &quot;news&quot; generic domain name. And some would argue that no one can own news.com, that in some &quot;right&quot; view of the world, &quot;news&quot; should get you to a Yahoo-like page listing of all the sources of news on the net. What's right? Who's to say scripting.com won't develop into a generic site that fully lives up to its generic name? Why is Netscape better qualified to cover scripting?"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, Netscape's move could cause a major redirection of dollar flow on the Net. If it works, a bunch of dollars are going to flow in Netscape's direction that used to flow another way. But there's a problem, if Netscape makes too much money, can't I download their source and ship a browser that works in *my* economic interest? Remember, Netscape is the open source browser. "/>
			<outline text="***They want feedback"/>
			<outline text="I usually don't like to give advice in DaveNet pieces, but when I spoke with Netscape marketing people on Wednesday evening, they specifically asked for feedback, so here goes."/>
			<outline text="1. Open up the keyword database. Show us what it contains. Let us study the issues it raises. Have a permanent dynamic page that allows users to see all the keywords, hot-linked to the sites they connect to. Internic's keyword database is open, as is AOL's keyword system. To be competitive, Netscape's database must be open too. "/>
			<outline text="2. Open up the protocol. Is it a cgi-bin? What parameters does it take? What does it return? If this catches on, other software may want to be compatible. Show us how it works. Even better, make this an application of XML-RPC. It's a perfect technological match."/>
			<outline text="3. Allow the user to choose a different keyword server. Allow competitive keyword systems to develop."/>
			<outline text="4. Split the Address text box in two. Keep the old functionality in the left hand box, and use the second box just for keywords. That way a problem becomes a feature; simply more functionality, it would be hard for anyone to object to it."/>
			<outline text="***Act of friendship"/>
			<outline text="I'm not sure the individual Netscape people I've spoken with understand that when I raise issues like this, it's an act of friendship. Maybe the collective Netscape will get it."/>
			<outline text="The friendship is based on a desire to have a real two-party system in web browser software. If Netscape's share should diminish, or be fragmented into two or more pieces of software (open source might make that possible) then the pressure on Microsoft to keep moving would be diminished. Therefore it makes business sense for me, and other web developers, to want to see Netscape go forward without losing share."/>
			<outline text="They might ask why I raise the issues publicly? It's simple. A publc beta calls for a public response. If they had done it privately, before users started experiencing the dislocation, I would have been happy to provide the feedback privately."/>
			<outline text="***Public betas"/>
			<outline text="In the discussion last week, Netscape said that it's a beta process at work. They can change things while the software is being evaluated. However, it's also a stake in the ground, a good-cop bad-cop thing (if they ease up they'll look good), a trial balloon and perhaps a shot from the hip (perhaps not). It's a fairly technical area, but it may have broad economic impact. It took the other news sources a few days to catch up, but they *are* catching up. I predict this will be one of the hottest discussions for the remainder of 1998, among all industry elements, especially people who hold stock in companies with generic domain names. (For example, broadcast.com.)"/>
			<outline text="Public betas can cause shifts in economics. They have to be as carefully thought out as full version product releases were in the past. Let's see fewer public trial balloons. Aim better. Discuss it privately with friends before unleashing poorly thought out ideas in public."/>
			<outline text="Further, I remember hearing that Netscape was committed to the open standards process. Has this changed? BTW, I don't believe they should do *everything* in an open way, they need a proprietary edge, and their chief competitor, Microsoft, is an information gathering machine. So some things have to remain private. "/>
			<outline text="But a crucial economic feature like the URL redirection in Netscape 4.5 is something that's very hard to support if it isn't openly documented and subject to replacement. I think it works against Netscape, longterm, if they try to exclusively own this feature."/>

			<outline text="Good evening."/>
			<outline text="I'm taking off for a few days, both pleasure and business, but before I take a hike, a big loose end to clean up."/>
			<outline text="On June 1, in &quot;Recasting&quot;, I said there was doubt whether my company, UserLand Software, would go forward. We were going to take Frontier commercial, and I wanted to be straight with our users, I wasn't certain that it would work. "/>
			<outline text="This morning, in a phone coversation with one of our users, I was reminded that I had never closed the loop on this. Now I'd like to do that."/>
			<outline text="It's working. We're going forward. We were profitable both in June and July. We made our July number on the 10th, and sales have stayed strong thru the month. We're developing a surplus and it feels like we're just getting started. "/>
			<outline text="We're doing important deals. The first one that's public is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodwill.siphoto.com/&quot;&gt;Sports Illustrated Goodwill Games site&lt;/a&gt;. We're working on others privately that we're very excited about and looking forward to showing off."/>
			<outline text="We're learning how our three products tie together and where they are separate. Clearly DaveNet, Scripting News and Frontier are related. Now we're starting to get formal about the relationships. We're acting like a business. Sorting out our priorities and our brands. We're aiming more before we pull the trigger. People are motivated by stock options. The usual company things. This is a group of people that very much wanted to be a real company. We're doing it."/>
			<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/rpc.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; is rolling. We've learned that steady consistent evangelizing works better than trying to make it happen fast. This is a technology we're serious about investing in because it plays so well to the strengths of our product and the skills of our community. It's a longterm deal. It's taking a while for the lightbulbs to go on, but it is happening. "/>
			<outline text="So it's still about people and technology and money, and now it's also about sales and customers too. We have great ambitions. We're going forward and I wanted everyone to know that."/>

			<outline text="***Bill's jam"/>
			<outline text="Bill Clinton is in a jam. Did he lie about having sex with Monica Lewinsky? The legal and political minds care, but his popularity is still high. "/>
			<outline text="I find the vision of Clinton having sex with Ms. Lewinsky in the White House disturbing. She could be a North Korean spy or assassin. Who else has he had sex with? The possibilities for blackmail are clear. "/>
			<outline text="On election day many vote morality, personal qualities and family values, but when the issue turns to indiscreet infidelity and lies to cover it up, when the pollster calls, many think it's an invasive and inappropriate subject. I think it's an important issue, for what it says about us, how thin and contradictory our collective values are."/>
			<outline text="***The tip of something larger"/>
			<outline text="Research into sexuality, even from an anatomic standpoint, is in its infancy. We used to think that the human clitoris is a small bump of flesh above the vagina. But an Australian researcher, Dr. Helen O'Connell of Royal Melbourne Hospital, published a report that shows it's actually much larger, that what we see is just the tip of something that's mostly internal. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.sjmercury.com/world/center/organ073098.htm "/>
			<outline text="How did we misunderstand this? Well, according to the article, previous research was based on examination of bodies of older women who died. O'Connell looked at younger bodies. Apparently the clitoris gets smaller as women age."/>
			<outline text="***Standard interfaces"/>
			<outline text="Switching gears, but not really, a couple of years ago I wrote a piece about standard interfaces for websites. Every site is a new experience. Is that good? Welll, hmmm. In many ways it would be better if there were standards for the organization of websites. It's one of the premises of XML, it was the discovery of the Macintosh OS in the early 80s. The web, in its early implementation, was a hodgepodge of coolness, with utility and inspiration hidden, if it was present at all."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/96/04/webUserInterfaces.html "/>
			<outline text="Now that's shaking out. We joke about the &quot;portal look&quot; creeping into the top-level sites everywhere on the Internet. All the portals look like Yahoo now. It's remarkable that the shakeout predicted in 1996 is now happening. The looks of all the sites are coalescing. "/>
			<outline text="Is there room for innovation? Sure! Just check out a Flash-based site. But in the meantime, it's good that evolution is happening, a lot of the experimentation is over."/>
			<outline text="***Tools"/>
			<outline text="One of the reasons it's cool to have standard interfaces is that we can make tools that generate content in these interfaces. The usual software leverage point. Separating content from form. If I know you want a Yahoo-like site, I can make a tool that only generates those sites. It can be simpler. This is one of the lessons that software teaches us over and over. "/>
			<outline text="***Ringling and Barnum"/>
			<outline text="Lately I've been getting out more and talking with people outside the software industry. I'm always surprised and flattered to hear that non-web-geeks are reading my site. Authors, lawyers, bodyworkers, artists, teachers, philosophers, people who wouldn't feel at home in front of a screenful of HTML code. A common comment. They read my site because they like the style but they don't understand much of what I'm talking about."/>
			<outline text="Hey neither do I! As I've said before, I'm a mystic. I love mysteries, I'm drawn to them. Writing is an exporation of mystery, an invitation to play ouija with me. The most interesting responses contain stunning ideas, contradictory information, challenging facts and ideas that remind me of the mystery. People who say do this or do that are telling an unfortunate story. The struggle to be god. No no no. That's not how we have fun."/>
			<outline text="Bless our rudderless political system, our lies about sexuality and the endless stream of Boy Kills Boy software stories. We get what we want. We must want to explore honesty,  sexuality and work out power issues. Occasional creativity comes from the struggles. That's the precious stuff and that's my formula. If an idea has a twinkle in it, it's mine! If it can reach our hearts, I go for it. Just like Ringling and Barnum. It's a circus out there. Same on my home page."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;The Emotional Age of the Internet&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/3/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Oh the Internet!"/>
			<outline text="I look back to the winter of 1996. I was bright-eyed and optimistic. When the Communications Decency Act came out of Washington I believed it was possible to counteract the forces of fear with sheer numbers. "/>
			<outline text="I organized a project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/24/&quot;&gt;24 Hours of Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, a large essay website, to show that there were thoughtful people on the net who had dreams of a new communication environment that would be more democratic, more inclusive, more interesting."/>
			<outline text="***The mail list"/>
			<outline text="AOL, a sponsor of the project, ran a mail list for people who were participating. I requested that participants use the list to coordinate work and express political opinions on their websites, not on the mail list. "/>
			<outline text="The purpose of the project was to show the power of the web, not the power of email. My theory, then as now, is that the web is a far more effective medium. People seem more careful about what they say. "/>
			<outline text="As the guest-host of the mail list, I repeatedly asked the other guests to stay on topic. Then the flames started coming directly at me. No good deed goes unpunished, or so it seemed at the time. Would these people behave this way if they were face to face at a meeting in AOL's office? I doubt it."/>
			<outline text="In the middle of the attacks I kept thinking of the silent ones. People who sit by, the majority of them, while a few people post message after message selfishly venting their emotional stuff. "/>
			<outline text="For example, when I posted an announcement that I would be off the list for an indefinite period, I had been called for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/96/03/juryduty.html&quot;&gt;jury duty&lt;/a&gt;, the discussion switched to a theory that the Clinton Administration had arranged it to deprive them of their leader. This still makes sighhh. It's so self-centered and unrealistically self-important. I assured them that this was a ridiculous idea. I had received my notice *before* the project started, but the paranoia continued. "/>
			<outline text="I unsubscribed from the list, unceremoniously, as I feel it should be done. Don't threaten, just do it. There's nothing more unpleasant than the final fuck you from someone who acts as if the world revolves around them. Just go. Quietly. Close the book and move on."/>
			<outline text="***Powerless and unheard"/>
			<outline text="I've been on the other side of this too. I've gone back and re-read some of my early postings on Apple, they're all still there, and I see the same thing. My face blushes, I missed something back then."/>
			<outline text="If Apple didn't recognize the role of a developer community, then no such community exists. When it's relative to a brand name or a company or a product, it must have recognition. I was committed to the existence of the Mac developer community, but it only existed in the minds of a few people."/>
			<outline text="In Austin, TX, at the closing dinner of an independent Macintosh web developer conference in the summer of 1996, I asked a question. &quot;Of all the people in this room, who is going to make $5 million in the next three years?&quot; Eyes darted, not landing on any individual. That wouldn't have happened in the PC software market, or in the early Mac market. People believed that a bet could pay off."/>
			<outline text="The obvious response was to get out. No amount of pain is worth the hard work of being a developer without any potential payoff. If there's no way to win, why are we working so hard?"/>
			<outline text="That's the realistic view, but in the mind-game world, powerlessness begets rage. People who realize they have no say in a future they're committed to, who struggle to stay there, even after the world has changed. Eventually you move on, go thru the stages of grief, starting with rage and ending with hope."/>
			<outline text="http://ub-counseling.buffalo.edu/Grief/grief.html "/>
			<outline text="If you move, you have power. If you stay, you remain powerless. I really believe that powerless people must want it that way. The instant they want to be relieved of powerlessness, they just have to exercise their power and it's gone. Poof! It's just like mathematics."/>
			<outline text="It's also like chess. Try this strategy. Move a knight back and forth endlessly. Your king will be dead in a few moves, if you're lucky. If you're unlucky, you're playing with someone else whose strategy is powerless knight-movement. You're in for a long game until you give up."/>
			<outline text="***No platform vendor"/>
			<outline text="The Internet is a more powerful seduction than the Macintosh, it has promise that the Mac never had, after all it's the platform without a platform vendor, so there's no one to blame for it getting stuck. Never mind, the collective net still blames Microsoft. It won't work, because Microsoft isn't responsible, as Apple wasn't. They never promised to take care of you, and honestly, realistically, you won't die if they don't. Yet the arguments have the seriousness of a life and death struggle. People use war analogies. It feeds their powerlessness, they act as a soldier in battle raging to stay alive; but they have neither the weapons or a realistic enemy."/>
			<outline text="No individual person is to blame for the failure of inspiration on the net, the blame lies with human nature. If we can evolve we can be powerful. If we have no discipline, if anything goes, we go back to the dysfunction of the houses we were raised in. It's like being in a bad marriage with millions of people. It goes bad in an instant. One day cool things are happening. Then someone feels powerless and acts on it and the cool things stop."/>
			<outline text="***It hurts so good"/>
			<outline text="Endless paraniod flamefests can be fascinating. It's a good vehicle for looking at your own pain. I watch other web writers deal with it. Here's my advice. You're growing if you go deeply into the pain that false accusations raise. Sure there's a person on the other side of the bits who hates you, lies about you, just like someone once did. But remember that they're just ones and zeroes, and that the person writing them doesn't know you. He's talking to someone else, the message has been addressed incorrectly. "/>
			<outline text="It works the other way too. Larry Tesler, the former CTO at Apple, said something brilliant to a friend of mine who sent him a flame letter. &quot;Someone is obviously using your email account without your permission.&quot; We laughed. What an elegant response. "/>
			<outline text="***Geocities"/>
			<outline text="Geocities offers free web hosting. Their users pay nothing. The company wants to put a watermark graphic on every page it serves. Users erupt in violent email, a contradiction in terms. A handful of supposedly powerless people have discovered that if they cry venomously enough via email, they'll get attention. "/>
			<outline text="Does Geocities have the power to put the watermarks on pages they host? Of course they do! What a silly question. Do the people using their service have a choice? Yes, they could go with Tripod or The Globe, or some other free page hosting service. Not only is it possible to switch, it's easy."/>
			<outline text="***Talking to your power"/>
			<outline text="In a series last month, I looked at Netscape's keyword server feature in version 4.5. My complaints came from a powerful place because I have a choice since Netscape has competition. It was actually a second derivative concern, I'm concerned about *becoming* powerless. "/>
			<outline text="I want Netscape to survive because if they don't, the web developer community, a potentially fictitious group, will cease to exist. If Microsoft is the only game in the browser business, they will define what it means to be a web developer. Then I predict a replay of the Austin scenario. "/>
			<outline text="I'm not writing this to raise your fear. I'm talking to your power. What can you do to raise the emotional age of the Internet? If you feel as I do, that the lowest common denominator rules, what can we do to balance that? I'm working on these issues right now. Comments are welcome."/>

			<outline text="It's been a coding week so far, doing lots of sweep-ups and beta releases of new gadgets. Inbetween, in spare moments, I do a bit of evaluating and thinking, looking around and figuring out. "/>
			<outline text="As I move I'm doing it differently. Once it was about accumulating things and now it's about casting them off. Keeping the good stuff, accentuating, emphasizing, enhancing it. "/>
			<outline text="Something changed, by chance I saw something that I had never seen before, I got a glimpse of another level of freedom. Now I think I know how to manufacture freedom, I have an algorithm, a way to use my intellect to spot the problems and then pick my feet up and step by step work around them. "/>
			<outline text="***Win-win"/>
			<outline text="I've said it's my philosophy many times. I believe that I can't win without you winning. If I try to make you lose, I don't win. I think this goes back to our primate roots, we are tribal by nature, and then we built a great civilization by extending the win-win principle. How could you make a freeway or skyscraper or the Internet without lots of win-wins? "/>
			<outline text="If we can work it out so that the energy you put into something furthers my cause, then I have doubled my efforts; and if I do the same for you, you've doubled too. It's just like mathematics, but not really. In this game, in this dimension, growth is where 1 + 1 &gt; 2."/>
			<outline text="I've said I only go for win-wins, but a lot of times I cast myself in a losing role. Of course I see it that way, but the people I deal with think they're losing, and don't spend much time thinking about whether I'm winning or losing."/>
			<outline text="Something big happened for me in May. I got lucky, pure chance assembled a set of people who behaved differently from the way I expected them to. I'm not being too dramatic when I say it shattered my assumptions. A lot of my beliefs broke. "/>
			<outline text="So, since May I've been appraising and deciding, and I've been walking away from lose-lose situations. It's hard to do, it's against all my programming, I needed to develop another voice inside my head, one that's programmed to ask two questions when evaluating an activity. First, am I winning here? And second, if not, is there any way to win? If there's no way to win, off to the dumpster! But only if I have the courage. If not, I wait a bit, and then look at it again. The issue is guaranteed to come up again. Round and round. That's the way it works."/>
			<outline text="So, I have a friend who has a mission but doesn't have everything he needs to accomplish it. I have what he needs. Can we make a deal? So I get a little of what he has (which turns out to be what I need to win), and he gets a little of what I have. "/>
			<outline text="When I wrote this I was thinking of a specific person. But as I re-read it, I realize that there are about a dozen people who it applies to! Maybe even more. This is interesting. That creates my objective -- to turn at least one of these potential win-wins into an actual win-win."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/14/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="An article on the Detroit News website. The author, Dirk Mathison of Parenting magazine, says it's good to listen when children tell stories about their dreams, especially nightmares. "/>
			<outline text="http://detnews.com/1998/accent/9808/11/08110010.htm "/>
			<outline text="He says &quot;if your child is dreaming about being chased by an angry unicorn, tell him that next time he has that dream he can build a fence around the beast or use a magic wand to make the unicorn friendly.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***food.find"/>
			<outline text="This is such an important idea, and it's not just for kids, it's for adults too. Dreams open up so much, when they're scary (adults have them too) that's a fear coming from deep inside. It's so real, and they aren't really dreams, they're you. "/>
			<outline text="Only a very small portion of you is conscious. It's not really a theory, it's a definition. Here's an example. Some part of you is coordinating the actions of your stomach and your mouth. Is the stomach is full? The mouth doesn't crave food. But when the stomach is empty, I gotta eat! "/>
			<outline text="The conscious part of me is just an observer to this process, I have no control over it. Some part of my body is running a program that connects the two events. An agent script that says if the stomach is empty, spawn a new conscious task, food.find (clock.now ())."/>
			<outline text="***Sometimes you're dreaming"/>
			<outline text="Sometimes you're dreaming when you think you're awake. When was the last time a thought popped into your head &quot;This person is just like my father!&quot; That's a clue. You're right on the edge of waking up from the dream at that moment. "/>
			<outline text="Instead of continuing the argument with the person who's not your father, go for a short walk, take some deep breaths, and dream up a solution. Just like the Detroit News story. Your subconscious has taken over, you're dreaming, and now, instead of waking up, consciously go deeper into the dream, and solve the damned problem once and for all. "/>
			<outline text="It's so amazing because it really works! I like to pour spaghetti on my father's head, and tell him that as long as I'm paying the bills in this house (I am!), he's going to do it my way. Sometimes I even lock my virtual father in the bathroom for 48 hours so he gets a chance to think about it."/>
			<outline text="OK, then, the next time &quot;This person is just like my father!&quot; pops up, take a deep breath and say to yourself, &quot;But we solved this problem!&quot; It's so true. You did solve it. The beautiful thing about the subconscious is that it can't tell the difference between dreams and reality. Repeat this just a couple of times, and you start feeling safe around your imaginary father or virtual mother, no matter how badly they're behaving. The dreams become happy, you become happy, because the problem is behind you, totally solved."/>
			<outline text="It's so simple, and it works so well. I'm not kidding. Kids dream about bad tigers and elephants, adults dream about bad moms and dads. The same solution works in either case."/>
			<outline text="***NLP"/>
			<outline text="This process is part of a relatively new exploration called neurolinguistic programming. NLP is the effort to find a common language that allows communication between the conscious and the subconscious parts of a human being. It's as interesting an exploration as scripting a network operating system, and I find that as I learn more about this stuff, the concepts of mathematics and computer programming map clearly onto the connection between the duality that I am, the conscious and the unconscious."/>
			<outline text="I wrote a piece last May called Programmers that was just the beginning of the idea that networked systems are models that externalize the internal communication system running on our own flesh-and-blood computers. From this point of view, computer programmers are like gods creating new beings modeled after own personal system software. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/05/Programmers.html "/>
			<outline text="Computer programmers can be students and teachers in this area. The literature about NLP talks about computers, but many of the people involved don't have software backgrounds so the analogies are relatively shallow. "/>
			<outline text="As I learn about this stuff I'm incredibly excited because I've spent the last 20+ years studying the internal workings of computers, and designing simpler systems for connecting them together, and then connecting the computers to humans. I'm especially interested in this final interface, I find that outliners map onto my internal storage system so well, this has always been intriguing to me. Back in the 80s I ventured as far as asking a few psychologists to help me understand why outlines work so well. Now I want to go deeper in understanding this. "/>

			<outline text="Today I'm using DaveNet to do research on the state of the net, specifically the deployment of XML-based applications. "/>
			<outline text="As with other connective technologies, XML is only interesting if other software and content developers support it. So let's find out what's available."/>
			<outline text="***Who, what... where?"/>
			<outline text="So, if you manage a content team or operate servers and are running apps that produce publicly accessible XML-formatted files, please enter the URLs for these files in this form:"/>
			<outline text="http://betty.userland.com/stateOfTheNet/xml/default.wsf "/>

			<outline text="We'll publish a report on our findings, as we go, linked into the Scripting News home page. If you're pointing to a private site, please say so in the Comment area and we won't publish links to your site."/>
			<outline text="We may re-run this survey in the future to see how XML is being deployed by other web developers."/>
			<outline text="***Expectations"/>
			<outline text="I think it's still early for XML-based information on the net. I would be very pleased if we turned up four or five interesting XML applications. Of course it would be even better if there were ten or twenty."/>
			<outline text="***Questions"/>
			<outline text="The main questions we want to answer are:"/>
			<outline text="1. How much XML is there on the net?"/>

			<outline text="Clinton lies, the videotapes run, he looks into the camera, I did not have sex with that woman, and last night he looks into the camera and says well, yes, I did. "/>
			<outline text="All the lies. The whole government machinery and press and the populace arguing about something he could have stopped, any day in the last seven months, with a simple truthful statement: I lied."/>
			<outline text="I'm sure if you've been reading DaveNet for a while you must know how I parse this. But I want to get on the record anyway."/>
			<outline text="The man lies. He tells the truth only when he's forced to. He was lying last night, I'm sure of it. It's just like Nixon all over again. He's going to take us down this road, step by step. I'm sure the lies will continue to unravel. Next month he will take full responsibility for lying to us last night. And of course his version of full responsibility is to give it to the special prosecutor. Another lie, right in our face."/>
			<outline text="You just have to listen. Some people say that Clinton didn't hurt them, so why should they worry? But what if we had a president who by default, told the truth and respected our form of government, one that requires people giving testimony to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Did he commit perjury? Yes, of course he did. I don't care about the technicalities! Get a grip Bill. More lies. This is such a sad situation."/>
			<outline text="We must want to be lied to. I hear people say he apologized, but he didn't. He says he accepts full responsibility, but he didn't. He says it's about sex, but it isn't, it's about what kind of leadership we want."/>
			<outline text="Clinton is a poor man, a man without integrity. If he resigned now he could leave office with some pride and our thanks, and he could begin a new life based on the truth, and so could our government. He could help the Democrats resurrect their integrity, and give Al Gore a better shot at winning the election in 2000. "/>
			<outline text="Most important, for us and him, we could think of Clinton as a class act, a man who learned the most important lesson that life can teach us, that truth is precious, and he was willing to pay the price. Learning it at 51 is no shame, some people never do. But he hasn't learned the lesson, he's still lying."/>
			<outline text="Further, think it thru, if he stays and we don't try him for lying under oath, we are fundamentally changing the legal system in the US. Every year public officials are tried, convicted and punished for lying. Are we saying everyone is accountable but the president? I say we should do it the other way. Everyone is accountable, especially the president."/>
			<outline text="Clinton is surely the lamest kind of lame duck now. He's right, it's time to move on. The best way for that to happen is for him to resign."/>

			<outline text="A quick short evening piece, I'm taking a long weekend, but amidst all the news of presidential downs and ups, wagging dogs and security holes, there have also been a lot of XML-related announcements today, including one from my company."/>
			<outline text="UserLand shipped a new version of Frontier today, version 5.1.3, a minor release, whose purpose is to get the remaining deal-stoppers out of our implementation of Frontier as an XML-Database. "/>
			<outline text="***XML-Database"/>
			<outline text="The fixes in 5.1.3 allow Frontier to manage large databases of XML content and data, making it possible for us to exchange information with other XML-compatible applications. "/>
			<outline text="It will be possible, for example, to store information that's edited in a spreadsheet or a slideshow presenter, using Frontier as a database and scripting environment, moving and sharing information between the apps. "/>
			<outline text="With Microsoft's committment to supporting XML in the Office 2000 apps, this should give people who know our tools a running headstart on building net-aware apps with Microsoft's productivity apps as content tools. And if XML should grow, as I am betting it will, it'll give us some room to grow too."/>
			<outline text="The XML-Database feature can also be used in distributed computing applications, and be hooked up to XML-RPC interfaces for apps that run over the Internet."/>
			<outline text="The importance of 5.1.3 is that at this point people can start seriously deploying XML storage applications running in Frontier. That is something I've been talking about all of 1998, and it seems like we've finally hit the milestone."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/changes/513.html "/>
			<outline text="Ye-hi!"/>
			<outline text="***My call for XML"/>
			<outline text="Earlier this week I put out a call for pointers to XML files on the Internet, and we got quite a few that way, and also with the help of HotBot, which has a very nifty feature that allows you to search for files with a given extension. We found a lot of XML content, and of course, we tested against it."/>
			<outline text="There's good news to report. For the most part the stuff that people are putting on the net is reasonably well-formed XML. That's a technical term. An XML purist will surely correct me and say that there's no ambiguity, either it conforms to the spec or it doesn't, to which I say that I don't agree. Even Tim Bray, one of the designers of XML, acknowledges a lack of clarity in the treatment of white-space. In other words, it's more complicated than a purist might think it is."/>
			<outline text="http://betty.userland.com/stories/daveWiner/98/08/msnp.wsf "/>
			<outline text="And developers are still putting out files with uppercase &amp;lt;?xml?&gt; headers. So, for now, we're accepting lowercase and uppercase headers (lowercase is what the spec says should be used). Eventually we will tighten up and *only* accept lowercase. "/>
			<outline text="And on other stuff we're being hard-asses. If it doesn't conform to the spec, we call it an error and refuse to load it. That's the only way to avoid the difficulties that we're dealing with in HTML, one of the predecessors to XML (the other one is SGML)."/>
			<outline text="***Validator"/>
			<outline text="We also opened up an XML Validator application today. If you are generating XML, please give it a whirl, and please let us know if there are any problems on our end."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/xmlValidator.html "/>
			<outline text="***James Clark and Brian Andresen"/>
			<outline text="At the same time as we've been working on our own XML parser, another developer, Brian Andresen of Technology Solutions, has been adapting one of the standard parsers, &quot;expat&quot; by James Clark, to run in the Frontier environment."/>
			<outline text="http://www.techsoln.com/frontier/blox/ "/>
			<outline text="It's the same parser as Netscape 5 and Perl will use."/>
			<outline text="And with other fixes in 5.1.3, we're finally ready to support ODBC connections and regular expression text processing in Frontier 5, and in 5.1.4, the COM-server functionality will be finalized."/>
			<outline text="***It's moving"/>
			<outline text="Things are moving fast now. Microsoft, DataChannel and Inso also had XML-related announcements today, so we're finally in position to do some connecting based on the new compatibility. "/>
			<outline text="There are two sides to our use of XML, XML-RPC is for coupling servers over the web, and XML-Database for storing information shared between XML-aware apps."/>
			<outline text="It's a good time to take a few days off, let the dust settle, and come back and see what's brewing. And in the meantime, god bless our president and our country! And while we're at it, let's say a prayer for the people who bomb our embassies, and kill Irish children, they are angry, and probably with good cause.

			<outline text="He says: &quot;Dave Winer, perhaps the Internet's most beloved programmer, can't stop talking about XML. He calls it 'a new kind of Web, one built of logic, storing objects and methods, not just pages and graphics.'&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Thank you, it's nice to be loved. "/>

			<outline text="***XML's Dance"/>
			<outline text="Life has loops, the Bees come back every year. And life is a dance, you never know where the next great idea will come from. "/>
			<outline text="Last year I proposed that we could improve the quality of searches on the web if we put a little bit of XML on every site."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/97/12/realWorldXml.html "/>
			<outline text="The XML file tells the search engine which files changed on a website. Today's search engines have to crawl an entire site to find the files that changed. On our site, www.scripting.com, usually no more than ten files change every day. But to get up to date, a search engine like Alta Vista or Excite has to read all 4761 HTML files stored on our main server. It's a ridiculous waste of resources, viewed one way, and it slows down the indexing operation, from the other side."/>
			<outline text="If the web were optimized, search engines could deliver more timely results. It wouldn't take several weeks for files on your site to show up in searches."/>
			<outline text="Here's another way to look at it. Project yourself into the future, five years from now, the summer of 2003. Can you imagine that search engines will still work this hard to get current? That there will be no coordination between webmasters and search engine masters? It could happen. Let's get started at working on this."/>
			<outline text="So here's an example &quot;SiteChanges&quot; file:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/siteChanges.xml "/>
			<outline text="This file is updated every 24 hours. It lists the URLs of all files that changed on the site. Any programmer on any OS, using any scripting language, could quickly write a script to create and update such a file. It took us a few hours to write the script that does it on our site. And a smart search engine programmer could write the code to look for this file and parse it (if it exists), in just a few hours."/>
			<outline text="This is a great opportunity for collaborative development, independent of the big companies. Webmasters, let's do something cool. Search engine guys, invest in the power of the web."/>
			<outline text="***XML Syntax Checker"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I posted a link to our XML Syntax Checker page to the xml-dev list; but I called it our XML Validator. I got almost a dozen messages from people who are very knowledgeable about XML who said it's not cool to call it a &quot;validator&quot; because our parsers are not validating parsers. Good point! So we renamed the page, stored it at a different URL, and this gives me an excuse to point to it again. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/xml/code/syntaxChecker.html "/>
			<outline text="I highly recommend this exercise to anyone else working on an XML parser. It's a good way to shake out the 7-by-24 bugs, and it helps to quickly show any errors in the parsing process, and we all (seem to) agree that having a robust standard in XML means having very tight parsers that reject poorly formed XML. We learned the lesson from HTML, looseness is bad for standardization. Usually I say Let's Have Fun! but this is one of those times when the slogan should be Let's Be Hardasses!"/>
			<outline text="***Memories"/>
			<outline text="A scene from a recent movie... I watch a women take notes. As she flipped thru her book, there were maps and schedules, lists and numbers.

			<outline text="Stop and think about it. What is yesterday? How much does it have to do with right now? I see a Bee, and I think Oh the Bees are back! And my internal computer knows what program to run, get out the Bee traps, juice them up. But, what if these Bees are different from last year's Bees? Will my strategy still work?"/>
			<outline text="It might. But it's a good idea to keep my eyes and my mind open. It could be that the Bees have figured out my strategy and have a workaround. Think about it. Last year I killed all the bees who were stupid enough to fall into my traps. Maybe they never got to reproduce? Maybe, unwittingly my purpose wasn't to create peace on my patio, as I thought it was; rather it was to help breed a new generation of smart bees?"/>
			<outline text="The bees give me so much to ponder, and for that I'm very grateful. "/>
			<outline text="***Gratitude"/>
			<outline text="We devote so much energy to the dance of our lives, who am I meeting with, who should I call, where do I have to be, how much money did I make, how much did I spend? And we devote so much energy to not dancing with our lives, avoiding this or defending against that, to avoid pain, to stay alive, to get rich, to be seen with the right people."/>
			<outline text="But how much are we dancing in the present moment and how much are we struggling to overcome the past? Do we study ourselves with as much care and attention as we keep our schedules, phone numbers, balance sheets and income statements? Where is the map of the loops in our lives, the conditions we fail to test, the lessons we learn over and over? And how do you feel about your loops? Are you angry with them? Do you deny they exist? What if you just were thankful for them? "/>
			<outline text="If I can show gratitude to the Bees of this year and years gone by and years to come, why can't I be grateful for the part of me that responded to my ancestors and siblings, gave them what they asked for, so I could survive to become the free adult that I am? "/>
			<outline text="Children have to please, and unfortunately, have to lie, to stay alive. But without those compromises, we wouldn't be here today. Something I saw as negative is easily transformed into the biggest gift I could possibly have given myself! Life."/>

			<outline text="In software it's very important who they compare you to. Back when we were a Mac-only developer, we were compared to AppleScript, which was hard to work with because our development and runtime environment is so different from Apple's. "/>
			<outline text="Now that we're cross-platform and have fleshed out our content management features, we're attracting the kind of comparison we want. New Media magazine focuses on multimedia developers, who are, more and more, web developers, and are likely to use either a Mac or Windows machine, or both. They're right in the center of the market we're working in, just like Adobe and Macromedia, so when they write a roundup of our category, it's great that they include us."/>

			<outline text="Maybe you can be somewhere more &quot;there&quot;? Hey the locals don't visit the icons, most people in NY skip the museums and the plays, New Orleaneans avoid the French Quarter, you get the idea, how do you really be somewhere?"/>
			<outline text="***Wanting to be in a creek"/>
			<outline text="On a trip a few years ago I was on a hike in New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo Mountains with a friend. We walked along a road that followed a mountain creek. I wanted to be there, so I took off my clothes and jumped into the creek. "/>
			<outline text="But while I was in the creek I thought about a lot of things. How do I look? Do I look silly? And I got scared. This is cold! Will I survive? My friend took out a camera. Don't take a picture! How awful. Ohhhh. Was I really there? Hmmm. No!"/>
			<outline text="***Wanting to be in baseball"/>
			<outline text="Like many other people I watched the Cards-Reds baseball game yesterday, hoping that Mark McGwire would break the home run record and my eyes would see it and my ears would hear it, that somehow I would be there, but would I? Would it feel that way? Yeah, I'd grin, I'd say &quot;That's really something&quot; but would I *feel* it? Would I really be there?"/>
			<outline text="The answer is no, of course. I'd be sitting in my living room watching a CRT displaying images of someone swinging a bat and hitting or missing a ball and other people talking about it. It could just be a TV show, I have no way of knowing that there's really a group of people doing all these things, or that it's happening right now. "/>
			<outline text="In fact it probably isn't happening now. Have you ever watched a TV broadcast of a game at the game? They play all kinds of tricks with time."/>
			<outline text="***Is TV real?"/>
			<outline text="On this last trip I met a smart man who works as a technician in the television industry. Of course in the 90s he's really a computer guy, we speak the same languages, C, Perl, Basic, you get the idea. He said that a few years ago the major American sports, baseball, football, basketball, hockey, changed strategy after seeing the success of professional wrestling, a completely imaginary sport."/>
			<outline text="He said that while the games weren't fixed (yet?) the promoters were more consciously emphasizing the personality issues. There's a lot more orchestration than you might imagine, my friend says. So when you hear Sammy Sosa say that Mark McGwire is The Man, he might be reading from a script."/>
			<outline text="Does it matter that McGwire is hitting more home runs than anyone else ever has? Is it even interesting? Do the people who &quot;were there&quot; for the big event get anything from it? Were they really there? Hey, more and more of what we experience is orchestrated not real, not spontaneous. Everything is compared against our expectations, as if our expectations had any reality to them. "/>
			<outline text="***The Baseball God is laughing again"/>
			<outline text="How cynical am I? Do I believe the baseball owners set it up so that the Cubs and the Cards would play against each other on the day when McGwire could break the record? Even better, it's happening on a major US holiday, when almost everyone is home and can watch the game on TV. Is this the biggest sporting event in history? It might be, at least in the US."/>
			<outline text="No, I don't believe they could have orchestrated the timing, but I totally believe they would have if they could. I think it's proof that there are greater messages available. The Baseball God is laughing again. If you still believe everything is ordinary think again."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/95/04/thebaseballgod.html "/>
			<outline text="The gods got our attention, and once again they show us that there's huge power that's beyond our perceptions. How did this happen? Who knows. That's what mysticism is about. Are McGwire and Sosa free agents, or are they part of some network that's designed to send a message to the rest of us? To me it's obvious that they are part of something bigger."/>
			<outline text="Well, it's almost gametime in St. Louis now. I'm going to watch the CRT and tune into the big show. I have more writing to do. But first, let's see what the Baseball God has to say today."/>

		<outline text="Really Being There" created="9/10/1998;  12:00:00 AM" name="reallyBeingThere" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;Really Being There&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/10/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning! "/>
			<outline text="So, according to my TV set, McGwire hit his 62nd home run on Tuesday night. "/>
			<outline text="As Kurt Vonnegut might say, Ho hum! "/>
			<outline text="Yes, I watched it, yes it was exciting, in a Hallmark sort of way."/>
			<outline text="Was I there? No way! I was in my living room. Playing a video game and watching the CRT out of the corner of my eye to see who was at bat. If it was McGwire, I watched the lights and sounds that the CRT was producing, if not, I was building a SimCity on a different CRT."/>
			<outline text="***Gratitude"/>
			<outline text="I am grateful to Mark McGwire for being such a warm and loving guy. He's a physically big man, as I am, and people often are scared of big male bodies, but he isn't afraid to open his heart and be vulnerable. For that, I am very grateful. "/>
			<outline text="I want to see more symbols of big open-hearted men who love to hug and be hugged, who respect themselves and are willing to be public role models for others. He shows us that it's OK to love a big man, and it's also OK for a big man to share his love. Good deal. Thanks Mark! "/>
			<outline text="***Is the net depressing?"/>
			<outline text="While I was on vacation last week, a story went through many of the major news sites. Is the net depressing? A group of psychologists did a study and the answer they came up with was yes."/>
			<outline text="Some have suggested that I write about this. OK. Sometimes I find the net depressing. What else can I say? Did I hope it would be otherwise? Yes I did, and still do. That's all I have to say on the net causing depression, for now. "/>
			<outline text="***Another hiking story"/>
			<outline text="On a hike a couple of weeks ago, my mind was drifting, somewhere in the past, somewhat in the future, out in space, anywhere but where I was. My left foot slipped and I lost my balance. By the time I was consciously aware of the mis-step, my right arm had shot out, counterbalancing the weight that was headed down the hill. With the very next step my left foot was back on the trail. I took a deep breath and my mind went back into the past, to analyze what had just happened."/>
			<outline text="I like to think I have a quick mind, but my subconscious mind is *much* faster than my conscious mind. It doesn't have to ponder a response to a life-threatening event. Or if does any pondering, it's imperceptible to me in a conscious way. It's very very quick. Of course it has to be quick or I would be dead. "/>
			<outline text="Every day my subconscious saves my life. It's a remarkable piece of machinery. And to some extent it's always in the moment, allowing my conscious mind to worry about all kinds of things. It seems to be saying &quot;Go ahead and worry about your silly stuff, I'll keep you alive, just in case you ever want to be here.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***The Computer"/>
			<outline text="Think about the human computer, the automatic, unconscious responses of a human being. The walking example above is a perfect illustration of its workings. It's as if I had a very powerful fast CPU on my shoulder monitoring all my muscles and senses, monitoring the balance indicators in my ears. An agent script that's always watching, ready to respond to any of thousands of different crises. A thousand different crisis-response programs. It's always running, always watching, always prepared to respond. "/>
			<outline text="The Computer's job is to keep the body alive and unbroken. It's monitoring things that I am conscious of, but it's also controlling things, like my liver and spleen, that I am not conscious of. There are shared spaces and there are private spaces. I can control my breath, to some extent, but I have no conscious direct control over my heartbeat, that's behind an interface called &quot;living&quot;."/>
			<outline text="But that's not all The Computer is doing. It's also involved in the unconscious functions of inter-human communication. For example, this email is largely, maybe entirely, being written by my internal computer, and the part of you that's reading it is part of your computer. If I had to stop and think consciously about where the T key is, then the H key, and then the E key, it would take many days to write a 20K email message. But over thirty years ago my computer learned how to flow words to a CRT screen by pressing keys, without involving my conscious mind, and it hasn't forgotten how to do this. "/>
			<outline text="So instead of taking days, it takes hours to write the text of a longish email message. And your computer recognizes THE as a &quot;word&quot;, not three letters. You don't have to think at a conscious level to understand what it means. You just get it. That's the subconscious, the computer, at work."/>
			<outline text="***Don's Amazing Puzzle"/>
			<outline text="Remember Don's Amazing Puzzle? "/>
			<outline text="It's worth repeating just to make this point."/>
			<outline text="How many F's are in this sentence? "/>
			<outline text="FINISHED FILES ARE THE RESULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTIF-&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="IC STUDY COMBINED WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS."/>
			<outline text="Your computer probably only sees three but there are actually six."/>
			<outline text="I won't spoil the delicious frustration; the solution is at the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;#solution&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;."/>
			<outline text="The bottom line: the conscious mind doesn't control reading. "/>
			<outline text="If it did you would see all six Fs."/>
			<outline text="***Patterns"/>
			<outline text="So if there are lots of things that are done unconsciously by The Computer, now flip the question around, what if anything is *not* automatic, unprogrammed and spontaneous? Maybe not very much!"/>
			<outline text="I already know that the computer is doing the typing, but who is doing the editing? Especially on a piece like this, my subconscious, my computer, is very much involved. It's telling me stories, about the past, imagining that I'm two years old and my mother has caught me saying these things. If I break any of the rules of my childhood, even those that I don't remember, my editor wants to delete what I've said. &quot;That could be trouble,&quot; my subconscious reminds me, &quot;it might be safer not to say that,&quot; it says in a threatening tone."/>
			<outline text="This isn't far-fetched. If you look at your own internal conversation I bet it works much the same for you. Some of us learned as children that it was OK to go ahead and say what you want (I'm obviously one of those people) and others learned it was better to be quiet, almost invisible, better to be seen and not heard. But maybe the pattern was set before we were children? Read on"/>
			<outline text="***Four-year-olds"/>
			<outline text="Some if not most psychologists believe that our attitudes and strategies are formed by the time we're four years old. Even worse, according to this school of thought, the most important experience was birth, all other influences pale in comparison. If this is true, then human relations is like typing and reading, automatic and deep, learned at an early age, hard to experience at a conscious level, and can only changed by carefully and patiently reprogramming the computer."/>
			<outline text="I see it in myself. My automatic response to an individual is to find a pattern he or she fits, and I respond to the pattern instead of responding to the person. Invariably the pattern is chosen from the few I knew when I was a helpless and dependent infant. I don't feel bad about this, for a couple of reasons. First, I have a lot of company, the world is filled with helpless four-year-olds in adult bodies. And second, as I've said before, if the strategies developed by my emotional computer hadn't been effective, I wouldn't have survived childhood, I wouldn't be here today. "/>
			<outline text="But even if the strategies work, if they keep the body alive, is the body happy? Is the body here, in the moment? Not until it gets connected to time as it's really flowing. A big adult body with the responses of a helpless infant can't be happy, can't be present, and can't be in the moment. Think about it, it's true by definition. If you're responding as a child would, and you're an adult, you are not in the moment. It's mathematical."/>
			<outline text="Being in the moment isn't psychobabble, it's central to being powerful, being appropriate, responsive, and thriving. When we act like freaked-out children, we're deep in the past, far from the moment, far from power, far from happiness."/>
			<outline text="***Breath and birth"/>
			<outline text="Breathing seems to be very important to deep relaxation, and relaxation is part of being in the moment (assuming there are no real threats to survival), possibly because it's one of the few activities that's shared between the conscious and subconscious. You can consciously hold your breath or accelerate it. But if you try to hold your breath too long, the subconscious takes over and forces you to breathe. "/>
			<outline text="Breathing is a shared space. I think the act of breathing is almost like a programming platform, an interface, a way to directly communicate between the conscious and subconscious. "/>
			<outline text="When I breathe deeply and consciously, my intellect sends a message to The Computer. Here's the message: &quot;I am breathing on my own.&quot; In other words, I survived birth. By writing this I'm getting goosebumps. I see this as a confirmation, from my body to my mind that the message has been received at an even deeper level. I made it! I'm breathing on my own. Ye-hi! Glad that's over. (My birth, that is.)"/>
			<outline text="***Cutting the chord"/>
			<outline text="I've done deep breathing, a kind of hypnosis, to travel to the core of my belief system, and even deeper, to learn that breathing is especially important for me because I had a unique challenge at birth, I was born with the umbilical chord around my neck. In my first moments of life, I had to solve a very big problem; I had to unwind the damned chord from around my neck, to keep it from strangling me! "/>
			<outline text="So at my core, before I had even taken a first breath, my computer had to solve a serious real-world problem. This struggle made a big impression, in fact it set the theme for my entire life. If my life were a movie, it would be a constant stream of serious problems to solve. It isn't the solution that's important, very often I don't solve the problem, it's the problem itself, and my struggle, that makes me feel like I have a chance to survive. Look at my resume for a clue. I'm a hole digger, I take things seriously, I want to succeed. "/>
			<outline text="But what I *really* want to do, at a deeper level, is to be born, so I can breathe."/>
			<outline text="***Debugging the computer"/>
			<outline text="There's the bug! "/>
			<outline text="In this moment, in 1998, I'm a 6-foot-2, 43-year-old, healthy man. I'm breathing. It's a demonstrable fact. But if you were to look into my subconscious, it's very confused. Sometimes it understands that I'm thriving, and other times it thinks I'm still in the birth canal, chord wrapped around my neck, trying every trick it knows to get untangled."/>
			<outline text="It's a big bug!"/>
			<outline text="***It's my symbol"/>
			<outline text="The umbilical chord is the major symbol in my life. It shows up everywhere, usually tangled around something, and in my dreams, around my neck. A few weeks ago I noticed that I tend to leave a garden hose in my swimming pool. Wow. My first thought, every time I jump into the pool is that I might get tangled in the hose, I fear I might drown."/>
			<outline text="If I want I can pull the hose from the pool. It's my pool and my hose. My power. That would be an in-the-moment action. An adult thing, to make swimming safe, to balance the fear of strangling on the hose. I can just take it out. As an adult who has been born, the hose is no threat. "/>
			<outline text="Now I'm in a position to write a much clearer and simpler autobiography. I was born with the umbilical chord around my neck. Therefore I am a do-er not a watcher. I don't expect anyone to do anything for me, they can't, I have to solve the problem on my own. "/>
			<outline text="It could be that my personality was formed by the birth experience, or it could be that I had this nature before birth. According to this logic, you will never meet a lazy baby who was born with the umbilical chord around his or her neck. It would be a mathematical contradiction, because lazy people born with a strangling chord die in birth. You have to be highly motivated to overcome this particular obstacle! You have to be solution-oriented."/>
			<outline text="***This moment"/>
			<outline text="Some functions of the computer are fully present, the parts that save your life, keep your system in balance. But other parts, the ones that pay the bills, cook the food, relate to friends, hit home runs, drive your car, are probably living in the past, using old strategies, sometimes very old strategies."/>
			<outline text="Nothing but patient retraining of the computer can allow that part of me to understand that the battle to be born is over. I can't get there by frightening the computer, or arguing with it. The only way to get there is thru understanding and care and patience, listening to the computer as you would a small child, with love and compassion and understanding."/>
			<outline text="My belief, if you do enough of that, consistently, you come into the present. You don't need to jump out of an airplane or ride a rollercoaster or see McGwire hit #63. Just do sensible things in the moment, always checking it out with the computer, and eventually you're there, tracking real-time, not living in the past; living in the present, in the moment."/>
			<outline text="***Psychology"/>
			<outline text="Psychologists debate nurture versus nature. They find that the net is depressing. I think they miss the point. Nurture and nature and the net are irrelevant to those of us, who, at a basic programming level still believe we're struggling to be born. "/>
			<outline text="Our parents are not that important either, as some experimental psychologists are now finding. Whether we got enough love or attention as children, or if our siblings were nice to us; none of this really matters because it is history, all that happened many years ago. Some psychologists now postulate that it's who we choose as friends that determine how we turn out, but I think the friends we choose are a function of our birth struggle, they reflect who we are, but they don't determine who we are."/>
			<outline text="Having survived my birth, what matters most is waking up from the dream, realizing that I'm a powerful independent and strong adult, living as an adult, not an infant struggling to survive being born."/>
			<outline text="***Where we go from here"/>
			<outline text="I'm definitely in an inflection-point. Trained as a mathematician and computer scientist, and with experience as a commercial software developer, manager and promoter, I'm drawn more and more to what makes us tick as human beings. I'm more interested in growth and evolution and friendship. That's primarily where my interest in communication systems, the Internet, comes from, and where my interest in outliners and programming systems came from. And of course the love of a juicy deep problem I can solve on my own. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="I believe that all this stuff is integrated into a whole, that the stronger and deeper our computer systems are, the more growing and evolving we can do as a species. Very few people write about this stuff, and I feel this is where I can make the greatest contribution."/>
			<outline text="I have been outrageously lucky to have friends, notably Richard Dorin and Bernd Steffan, people with powerful intellects, huge integrity, patience and generous spirits to talk about this stuff with me, to teach, to share what they know. They are now discovering the power of electronic communication systems, with my help and a generous donation of hardware from Apple founder Steve Wozniak. I feel like we're climbing the same mountain from two sides, on one side the exploration of our true nature as human beings, and on the other side, developing external models of our intelligence and ideas, to create new flows, new potential, new discoveries."/>
			<outline text="Believe it or not, all this started for me when I wrote a couple of essays four years ago about the Internet and Apple, platforms, Chinese households and Bill Gates. My computer was struggling to be heard. It had a story to tell, the story had to get out of my body, others had to react, a drama had to result, so I could see for myself that my body is powerful and adult, and no one can stop me from saying what I wanted to say. It really is that simple. It didn't matter what my computer wanted to say, it just had to find out that it could speak and be heard. Voila! The door opens for the next level of growth."/>
			<outline text="So for the last four years I've been chipping away at the edges. Part of me was scared to tell the full story, and part didn't know the full story, at least not at a conscious level. All along I expected that at some time I'd be able to bring the whole thing together, explaining how computers and people are relevant to each other. Now I think I'm ready to do that, or at least I can take the process to the next level."/>
			<outline text="So here's how it comes together. The computer networks we build are very simple models of the operating systems running in our own bodies. The Internet is a way of externalizing who we are, a great way to look at what's inside. We're learning machines, evolution machines, possibly the top of the evolution tree on this planet. The computers made of silicon and plastic are very simple models of the ones we have inside. The silicon computers are mere projections of what's inside of us, very powerful projections, so powerful that they are capable of modifying what it means to be human."/>
			<outline text="Now that the wires are linking our desktops, new models of communication are possible that have never been possible before on such a large scale. The depression we see on the Internet, I believe, is a result of not yet knowing how to use the power. A bit of trial and error. I'm sure that the net can help bring us into the moment. If this piece helps me get there, that's all the proof I need."/>
			<outline text="Now the path is a lot clearer for me. There are two sides to the mountain, and I want to go up both. Exploring humanity and fitting the new technologies to enhance that. More trial and error, one step at a time. It's great to be alive, breathing and creating!  As usual..."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="That's really what it's all about."/>

			<outline text="Good evening!"/>
			<outline text="First a warning. There are some people who don't want to read about the US moral crisis. If you're one of those people, please tune out now. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind, I just want to discuss what I see. Most people don't seem to have a problem, but if you do, it's totally OK to not read this piece."/>
			<outline text="About Thursday's piece, &quot;Really Being There&quot;, there were a few responses, some very sweet, from former children struggling to be adults. Welcome to the club, it's always good to hear from other people who want to transform from being a helpless child to being a powerful adult. I'm in that struggle myself, every adult is, I'm sure of it."/>
			<outline text="***Human first, president second"/>
			<outline text="So we know that Clinton is a human being. That means he's a child in an adult body, dealing with the struggles of his past. No conscious adult would do what he did, have sex with a woman who's not his wife when the chance of getting caught was virtual certainty. He wasn't acting as an adult when he got involved or when he lied to cover it up."/>
			<outline text="***It's not news"/>
			<outline text="The problem isn't with Clinton, the problem is with us, the adult electorate of the US. He gave us clear signals that this is who he is. On CNN last night they ran tapes of Bill Clinton's contrition over the years, going back to a humbled twenty-something Clinton with black hair saying almost exactly what he said at the prayer breakfast on Friday. "/>
			<outline text="They also showed the famous 60 Minutes interview when he said that sexual infidelity was part of his past, that he understands how serious the Presidency is, and it's all behind him. Hillary holding his hand, providing confirmation that it's behind both of them."/>
			<outline text="The best clip they showed was Clinton on Friday, his head bowed in humility, a somber look on his face. But in a second, he lifts his eyes and looks right into the camera. An indescribable look in his eyes, an awareness of the camera, betraying that even this is an act."/>
			<outline text="Clinton speaks deliberately. We have to read between the lines because he is never direct with the truth. We had all the evidence we needed to make a decision when he was just a candidate, but we voted for him anyway. Now some of the truth is out in the open, and Clinton is doing what he does, he's trying to pave it over, air-brush it, give the appearance of it being dealt with, so we can get back to business as usual. He calls the Starr Report a smear job. He didn't say he didn't do those things, typically slippery Bill. Divert the attention. Same old same old. He's never going to learn!"/>
			<outline text="I find it disgusting that he's hiring new lawyers to defend against the perjury charges. It means it's all going to be dragged out. There are several hundred million Americans, and one of them is making sure he gets the majority of the attention. Where is his shame? His repentence? A truly humble man, at this stage, would throw his fate on the mercy of the people, not legally split hairs over what is and isn't perjury."/>
			<outline text="***Let's be adults"/>
			<outline text="Let's be adults, and let's take responsibility for this country. "/>
			<outline text="Read the Constitution, he works for us, he isn't us. If the country is doing well that's because we're doing well. It's not about Clinton."/>
			<outline text="***Let's make a deal"/>
			<outline text="As a member of the US electorate, here's what I want Clinton to do. First, stop arguing about whether or not the testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case was perjury. Give it up. It doesn't matter because he lied in every other venue, even if he didn't commit a crime. He looked into the camera and lied. He lied to our employees, Cabinet members and White House staff. And he lied to us, his employers."/>
			<outline text="But the lies weren't his biggest sin, making himself the issue is the big one. It's so selfish, so childish, and it continues, in ever-bigger ways."/>
			<outline text="An adult looking at this situation would say it has gone far enough. If Clinton won't put his personal interests behind those of the country, we must do it for him, no matter how much pain we feel doing it. Make a deal that allows us to go forward. After Clinton resigns, no prosecution. He gets his life and we get back the presidency and hopefully we have learned to demand plain straight talk from our elected leaders. This used to be an American value, a good one. Let's bring it back."/>
			<outline text="***Bedtime stories"/>

			<outline text="First a humorous note."/>
			<outline text="The last piece, &quot;Adult Talk&quot; was automatically removed by a lot of people's email filters because its title contained the word adult. "/>
			<outline text="In American English of the late twentieth century, the a-word indicates that the message contains material that's offensive to many people. "/>
			<outline text="This message also contains adult content. As do all DaveNets, hopefully."/>
			<outline text="What irony! "/>
			<outline text="***Which is worse?"/>
			<outline text="I've gotten a series of rebuttals in a common theme."/>
			<outline text="They all pose a question -- which was worse, Iran-Contra or the way Clinton handled the truth in the Lewinsky affair? What about Chile, The Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, the bombing of Cambodia?"/>
			<outline text="Reaching the heart of this question: &quot;Was FDR a liar because he deceived the country about the extent of his disability?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***A moving target"/>
			<outline text="These are interesting questions because they reveal a sleight of hand, a bit of tricky logic. My inner-mother asks &quot;If they all jumped off a cliff, would you do it too?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Public values shift over time. Perhaps the electorate is becoming more adult, and less likely to overlook blatant dishonesty and abuse of power. Or it could be that we collectively elected Clinton so we could examine our own opinions about integrity and truthfulness. "/>
			<outline text="Maybe in the Age of TV a man like FDR couldn't have been elected?"/>
			<outline text="I don't think we can come to any conclusions, the subject we're analyzing, the electorate, is a moving target. "/>
			<outline text="In any case, it doesn't matter. What is is. For whatever reason, enough people care about what's going on with Clinton to make it a public issue. It's impossible to say how it would have gone if this had happened in the thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, seventies or eighties. Different times, different people, different results."/>
			<outline text="***Bruce Hughes on Clinton"/>
			<outline text="The most powerful message I got was from Bruce Hughes. Here's what he said."/>
			<outline text="Dave, I read your piece, and thought about it. I have to disagree with your recommendation of making a deal to not prosecute Clinton for perjury if he resigns."/>
			<outline text="The reason I disagree is that I believe what I heard Howard Baker, who was on the Watergate Select Committee (remember, &quot;What did the President know, and when did he know it?&quot;) say in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft last Sunday. Roughly, here's what he said. &quot;There is a process laid out in the Constitution for dealing with this situation, and we should follow it. If Clinton resigns, we will have had two Presidents this century resign under threat of impeachment, and that would move our country much closer to a parliamentary form of government, where the President serves at popular whim. I don't think that would be good, and I don't think it would be consistent with the character of the American people.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I am a lifelong Democrat, and I hate what Clinton has done to embarrass and humiliate the progressive political forces in this country. I have flirted with the thought that it might be better for the Democrats (and, in my view, the country) if Clinton were to resign and give Gore a chance to show what he can do. But I don't think so. We looked Clinton in the eye, and voted him into office anyway. Now that choice has consequences for the American people, and we need to face them and live through them. Otherwise, we will forego the opportunity of learning from our mistake."/>
			<outline text="Let Congress do its job, tell your representatives what you think, but let each of them vote his or her conscience. Let Clinton fight for what he undoubtedly considers his survival. Let's do it in public, air out all the dirty laundry, open the wounds, wash the pus out, and, after it is all over, try to get ourselves clean."/>
			<outline text="bhughes@choicemicro.com"/>
			<outline text="***What a great message!"/>
			<outline text="I think Bruce is onto something.  "/>
			<outline text="Certainly if public opinion polls are any indication, Clinton will remain in office thru his term, and will probably end up totally hating his job. In every press conference he'll be asked if he's lying or telling the truth. He'll deserve it, and so will we. In the next two years we'll learn a lot about the importance of truth-telling. Who knows, maybe in 2000 we'll elect a president, like Jimmy Carter, who admits that he lies in his heart."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;We'll Keep Clinton&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/22/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I watched TV yesterday morning and last night, watched an hour from the Clinton grand jury testimony, and bits from Clinton's United Nations speech. I also watched Larry King Live on CNN."/>
			<outline text="I was impressed with Clinton's testimony. I can relate, I can imagine being in his shoes and not being able to keep it together as well as he did. Have I ever cheated on a relationship? Yes I have. Have I ever had sex in an inappropriate place? Absolutely. Have I ever lied to keep the truth from coming out? I'm embarassed to say that yes I have. How would I explain it in a suit, in front of the video cameras? I'd shrug it off. I'm a person. Get a clue. I'd be happy if I could do this as well as Clinton did in his videotaped testimony."/>
			<outline text="There was a tremendous contrast to the Clinton testimony on August 17, and his public address later the same day. Clinton would have been better served if he had taken a few days off between giving the testimony and speaking to the world. "/>
			<outline text="My &quot;Truth Decay&quot; piece was a response to his public statement on August 17. I was outraged, justifiably, at his continuing spin, denial and lies. Now it's clear that he kept his cool in the testimony, relatively, and used the evening TV address to vent his rage, that most of us didn't share or understand, at his prosecutors. Not good public relations, and not a smart way to talk to your employers when your job is in jeopardy."/>
			<outline text="There might not have been a way to avoid the rage. The story was going to come out, it may have been better to get it all over with right away, and it may not have been possible for (some of) us to see that there are two sides to this story. "/>
			<outline text="I was touched by the standing ovation that the president received at the United Nations. Don't miss this. The world needs leadership. The United States is in a unique position. The other countries are powerless until the cameras show up at the UN, and then they can stand up and show us that we could view this differently."/>
			<outline text="I watched Larry King Live, and saw there is nothing new. They're having the same discussion they've been having for the last few months. I find now that my opinion has shifted. I'm tired of the argument that he has to leave, I think it would cost too much, and I believe that there are other preferable solutions."/>
			<outline text="***We'll keep Clinton"/>
			<outline text="Let's keep Clinton for two more years. I don't think he'll do it again, any of it. We may have the most refreshingly honest two years of presidency in several generations. The cost of switching presidents now would be very high. The cost of miring ourselves in the depths of these details is even more consequential. Based on the experience with the Nixon resignation, I think we'd be recovering from this for ten or fifteen years. We could do it differently."/>
			<outline text="We've spoken. We've found the line that we don't want our presidents to cross. "/>
			<outline text="We actually have a pretty good president, if you can consider, in balance, his unacceptable acts against the positive ones. I would have supported impeachment and removal for his signing the Communication Decency Act, one of the most reprehensible things any president has ever done, in my humble opinion. A high crime and misdemeanor? Absolutely. There's nothing more precious than free speech and nothing more deserving of protection than a new medium. Impeachment was never seriously considered for this act, probably because Congress passed the law that he signed. There are probably a few essays in this idea, maybe we'll get to that later."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, Clinton has stood up for some individual rights, probably for the wrong reasons, but it doesn't matter. The US economy appears healthy, and although I don't believe he deserves the credit for this, a change in presidents is likely to upset the prosperity because we could lose focus, easily."/>
			<outline text="Clinton clearly doesn't have a philosophy, but that doesn't mean we can't have one. There are checks and balances, the power in Washington is distributed. There's an election on November 3, and his job and our continued approval is going to mean a lot to him, a lot more than it did when he acted so carelessly."/>
			<outline text="Finally, to people who insist that this stuff shouldn't be on TV, I don't agree. Let's get it all out. If you don't like seeing it on TV, I have a solution for you. Stop watching TV. It works."/>

			<outline text="Good morning: DaveNet."/>
			<outline text="People! Let's have a discussion here."/>
			<outline text="Last time we talked, the Clinton outrage was still fresh. "/>
			<outline text="The Microsoft trial was dormant, somewhat forgotten, it didn't seem important."/>
			<outline text="But things changed when the trial started, now it's the top story, and the government is digging up old stuff that's just plain wrong. "/>
			<outline text="***What's wrong"/>
			<outline text="Who's responsible for the demise of Netscape? The government would like to make Microsoft the scapegoat. But is this even remotely scientific? Where was the control? Did Netscape do everything they could to be successful? Did they play the software game with a strategy that had even a remote chance of success? No way!"/>
			<outline text="I wrote about this in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. I begged Microsoft to bend over to let Netscape survive their ineptness. But Microsoft was under no obligation to make it easy for them, and Netscape did everything in their power to provoke Microsoft. They challenged them at their core, their goal was to replace Windows. They said it publicly, often, in every possible way."/>
			<outline text="***The Windows Company"/>
			<outline text="As a person who studies Microsoft, I have to know what's at their core. Who are they? Well, they're The Windows Company. If you challenge Windows, and if Gates believes you have a chance, he'll come at you with everything he has. It was well-documented behavior in 1995, the crucial year in the government's case. I shared this insight publicly in many DaveNet pieces. It was realllly well known. "/>
			<outline text="Did Netscape have a choice? Did they have to loop back and challenge the old way of doing things? Sheez, they had the ideal situation. They should have resisted comparison with Windows, instead they invited it. We watched with fascination. Do they know something we don't? Even though Microsoft was so strong, we believed that Netscape had a chance. But they had to be smart and effective and instead they were arrogant and ineffective."/>
			<outline text="***A murder trial?"/>
			<outline text="It's a very strange situation, a murder trial, but the victim isn't dead. Further, if the victim should die, the cause of death wasn't murder, Netscape will have died of natural causes. "/>
			<outline text="It's true that software company death happens all the time in Silicon Valley, and often Microsoft is somewhere near the corpse at the time of its demise, but it's totally unscientific to conclude that Microsoft is responsible. If you field an inadequate team to play against a professional team with deep experience and deep pockets, and the other guys win, are they to blame? How so? What could Microsoft have done differently? Did they ask that Navigator be positioned as a threat to Windows? Where's the evidence of that?"/>
			<outline text="The real problem at Netscape in the mid-90s was that they weren't ready to play the game at the level they were playing it. Barksdale, the CEO, wasn't immersed in the culture of his users, his employees, or the technology they were developing. Andreessen, the CTO, didn't have experience. Neither of them were part of the engineering culture of Silicon Valley, they couldn't forsee the development problems that would eventually haunt them."/>
			<outline text="So now it's a few years later, and they're battle scarred. Good for them! Now maybe they can be a real software and services company with a realistic business plan."/>
			<outline text="***Think!"/>
			<outline text="Netscape may have missed the chance to lead the web generation, perhaps this is a waste, but they still have a chance to be part of it. "/>
			<outline text="As always, their goal is to become more mature, more businesslike, smarter, more knowledgable about the industry they're part of. The government lawsuit is bad for Netscape because it's a distraction. Netscape just can't win this way. "/>
			<outline text="It's possible that Microsoft can be hobbled, but Netscape, if they persist in positioning themselves as a victim, will never overcome it. It's hard work to sell software. I think that's what Netscape is learning. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft can't be everything. They're just Microsoft. I think it's easy to co-exist with them, you just have to be clever, you just have to think and have that thinking reflected in your products and you have to ship them, and the reviewers and users have to like them. You have to study Microsoft in minute detail. You have to be smart, and persistent, and have a long term strategy, and have the courage to change your mind and go in a different direction. And you have to be right almost every time out of the gate. These are good things to do! Netscape is just beginning to show some of this. "/>
			<outline text="I don't support the government protecting Netscape when they've offered so little of what I believe is required to be successful in this business. I don't think it's good for the people, I don't think it's good for Netscape, I don't think it's good for the economy or good for justice or good for technology."/>
			<outline text="Success is a reflection of intelligence and drive and effectiveness. Thinking and doing, that's what counts. Looking back at the history of Netscape vs Microsoft, I wouldn't change a thing. The outcome was completely predictable, but only partially because of Microsoft's predictability. It was also the predictable result of Netscape's strategy. Did they have a choice, or did they have to directly challenge Microsoft? They actually had many choices. For me, that closes this case. Let Netscape find its niche, independent of Microsoft, let the market shake it out. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Check it out. IBM is investing in Apache now. That's what it takes to win. Be creative, look for the doors that are already open or don't even exist; stop trying to break down fortifications. Life is too short. Technology moves too fast. It doesn't take much time before the fortresses are worthless."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Another thing to check out. Netscape could have bought Apple and had their own OS with millions of users. In other words, they could have executed their kill-Windows strategy much more effectively. They sniffed. But look at what Steve Jobs has been able to do at Apple, years later. There was value and they chose to ignore it."/>

			<outline text="As an aside, this pretty much proves that I don't sit on stories. It's been a long day, and the last thing I thought I'd be doing at 6:51PM on a Friday night is writing a detailed technical piece. But it's an important subject, and there's  some exclusive news here, so stop the presses and let's get reallly deep.."/>
			<outline text="***Guha"/>
			<outline text="Earlier this evening I spoke with Ramanathan Guha, guha@netscape.com, the lead developer of the What's Related feature in Communicator 4.5. We talked about privacy concerns I raised yesterday on the Scripting News website."/>
			<outline text="After the talk I have some changes to make to my earlier statement, and they are making some changes in the next release, Communicator 4.5.1."/>
			<outline text="***How it works in 4.5"/>
			<outline text="First, according to Guha, if you never click on the What's Related? button, your URLs will never be sent to their server. "/>
			<outline text="If you do click on the button, it then sends the URL to the server, and gets back a menu of related sites, which it displays. It's at this point that you may be sending URLs, and may not realize it."/>
			<outline text="Then for the next three sites you visit, it pre-fetches the What's Related menu, sending the URLs to the server. Here too you will be sending links to the Netscape server and may not realize it."/>
			<outline text="***An example"/>
			<outline text="Say you go to www.infoworld.com and click on the What's Related button. The server now knows that you were at www.infoworld.com. "/>
			<outline text="Then you choose www.news.com from your Bookmarks menu. Because they pre-fetch the menu, their server knows you visited www.news.com. And the next two sites you visit too."/>
			<outline text="***Why it's a conern"/>
			<outline text="Maybe you like porn sites. Or maybe you support a controversial political cause, or are just interested in learning more about one. Maybe you or a loved one has a disease that you're researching. Maybe you're gay and you don't want anyone to know. These are the kinds of concerns people could reasonably have."/>
			<outline text="***There's a cookie in here too"/>
			<outline text="Further, in the current release, Netscape is sending a cookie along with the What's Related request. This would mean that Netscape could link your site preferences with your name and address, if you had registered with other services running on a Netscape server. "/>
			<outline text="They say they are not recording this information, and that their servers are audited by Coopers and Lybrand, a famous accounting firm. But, of course, new management could come in at Netscape and change these policies. Users would have no way of verifying that such a change in policy had not occurred, and Netscape would be under no obligation to inform them."/>
			<outline text="***Changes in 4.5.1"/>
			<outline text="According to Guha, there will be two changes in the next release of Communcator:"/>
			<outline text="1. When it does a What's Related fetch, it will display a dialog warning of a possible security concern, similar to other such dialogs in their browser."/>
			<outline text="2. The browser will be modified to not send the cookie on the What's Related request."/>
			<outline text="If they make these changes, I'm satisfied. My main concern was that people would be transmitting possibly personal information to Netscape without knowing that they were. "/>
			<outline text="The first change makes sure the user knows what's going on and the second change makes sure that Netscape can only gather aggregate data, and not relate it to individual users."/>
			<outline text="***Paul from Netgravity checks in"/>
			<outline text="As I was putting this piece to bed, I got an email from Paul Nakada, pnakada@netgravity.com, a programmer at Netgravity who works on reporting and warehousing of exactly this kind of personal information. He asked me to say that he speaks only for himself, not for his company."/>
			<outline text="He says: &quot;Even though there might be no cookie being sent, don't think they're not trying to determine who you are. Combine IP address, user agent, referrer, time of day, etc. and they can get pretty close to determining who you are. Correllate that with their user database, and bingo, who needs cookies."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Also, how does this privacy concern compare to phone companies with records of every call I make and credit card companies with records of purchases I make and travel patterns. I freely give these services intimate details of my life, but for some reason a web browser gets me all uptight?"/>
			<outline text="&quot;And how does What's Related tracking differ from an ad network (Doubleclick, Linkexchange, Netgravity) tracking you from site to site?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Those are good questions! If there was some way to avoid giving personal information to phone and credit card companies, I would. Those decisions were made a long time ago, before I was alive. We're exploring the issues with browser software now. Here I am, doing my thing. As for the other issues, you're the expert, I'm the student."/>

			<outline text="I just finished reading the &quot;Halloween Memo&quot; which got a lot of play on the net yesterday, along with comments from Eric S. Raymond."/>
			<outline text="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/halloween.html "/>
			<outline text="I found Raymond's comments distracting as I was trying to understand what the memo was saying, so I wrote a little script that removed Raymond's comments, and posted the result here:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/misc/halloweenMemo.html "/>
			<outline text="If you are a user of Microsoft software, or a developer who builds on their system software and/or apps, I highly recommend reading this piece. I believe it's real. If so, it provides a glimpse into the thinking process at Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="It's about more than open software, there's probably a similar paper inside Microsoft on the Department of Justice and one on IBM, and quite a few, over the last few years on the web and Java."/>
			<outline text="Here are my notes after reading the piece."/>
			<outline text="***How Microsoft Thinks"/>
			<outline text="As you might imagine, Microsoft is looking to embrace the ideas of the open source world, and is thinking if it will diminish their role as the dominant operating system software company."/>
			<outline text="I agree with their major conclusion that right now open source software is powerful on the server, and not in strong position on the desktop, on client machines or on content workstations."/>
			<outline text="They note IBM's recent increased involvement with the Apache web server. They also note a falloff in interest on the Mozilla mail lists, which they archive internally. A reminder to people who believe Microsoft isn't watching and listening, it's better to assume they are."/>
			<outline text="The piece talks openly about FUD, Fear Uncertainty and Doubt, and acknowledges that the leading open source products, Linux, Apache and Perl, aren't vulnerable to FUD, since their continued existence isn't in doubt. "/>
			<outline text="One of the most interesting sections is towards the end, talking about ways of blunting attacks from the open source world. While XML isn't mentioned, it's behind the discussion on WebDAV, with a prediction that the Apache organization won't pick the right way to invest in WebDAV, and presumably this will provide an advantage to Microsoft, server-side. "/>
			<outline text="I find this very interesting because my company has been trawling on the edge of WebDAV, experiencing the same kind of confusion. It may be that WebDAV is just plain confusing, equally so to the people at Microsoft. Or there could be an ace up their sleeve that we can't see. "/>
			<outline text="There's no mention of XML-RPC, but it does talk about MSMQ for Distributed Applications. What is that? I don't know."/>
			<outline text="To understand this memo and to understand Microsoft, remember that this is a very big company with thousands of employees. Unless they're organized by an outside threat, they often move slowly and in a confusing way, both internally and to people outside Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="This memo represents one slice of the thinking of this organization, both in time and in people. It's almost certain now, three months later, that Microsoft has a different focus, a different set of priorities and a different set of issues they're working on."/>
			<outline text="I see it differently from Raymond, who polarizes things as open source versus closed source. I think, as Microsoft does, that many of the supposed discoveries of open source are actually discoveries that apply to all software, independent of their economic model. In fact, what's really going on is the opportunity of the Internet to displace centralized software companies, like Microsoft, is being wasted because of insignficant lines between non-Microsoft development organizations. "/>
			<outline text="***Open source is a fixture"/>
			<outline text="Earlier this year I made a bet with some Microsoft people that before long they would be releasing source code as a normal part of their development and release process. They said it will never happen. In the memo it's clear that they're now considering releasing parts of the Windows source code, for example, the TCP/IP stack. Although people on both sides of this fence doubt it will ever happen, I remain sure that Microsoft will adapt and in some ways match Linux, Apache and Perl, and will probably embrace open source to a greater extent than anyone now thinks possible."/>
			<outline text="And that's the way it will work for all software companies. The ones that are starting around SendMail, Linux, Perl and Tcl (what else?) will release proprietary software in binary form (many already have) and Microsoft, Adobe and Symantec (and UserLand) will release parts of their technology base in source form. This is a transition that began a long time ago, and it's accelerating."/>
			<outline text="***Visible Embrace and Extend"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has had recent great success with its Embrace and Extend strategy in its competition with Netscape and Sun. It's virtually certain that they will respond to  open source with the same tactic, that they won't resist open source, they will embrace the idea and then take it where they want it to go. "/>
			<outline text="For the first time, this memo reveals the process at work, it's visible and it's pure Microsoft. If the memo isn't real, it was written by someone with a very deep understanding of how Microsoft works and thinks."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;How a Windows Developer Thinks&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/4/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I'm glad that the Microsoft memo leaked, because it showed, openly, how disciplined, thoughtful and creative you have to be to exist in the software business for a long time. "/>
			<outline text="The open source advocates are misled if they think that they &quot;get&quot; something that other software developers don't. That's a very dangerous place to be. If your ideas catch on, you can be sure of two things. First, it's probably been done before, someone else knows even more about it; and second, the smart people who don't understand what you're doing will study it, and eventually will figure it out."/>
			<outline text="We saw this in the Mac, in Java and in the web. All were good ideas. And in all three cases, the proponents mistakenly thought they had a purity of vision and a style of programming that couldn't be emulated. Oh how wrong they were. You gotta keep it moving, you have to do more than drink the Kool Aid, you have to be creative about who you will work with, and you have to go where the market takes you."/>
			<outline text="Luckily, we're seeing some of that happen in the open source world. That's good!"/>
			<outline text="***PhotoShop and open source"/>
			<outline text="Open source is a major way to gather developer momentum. All the specs in the world can't equal a piece of running code that I can copy and bake into my program. Start with something simple, test it out, prove that it works (or that it doesn't) and then proceed. This is the programmer's way to build ever more complex machines."/>
			<outline text="When an idea catches on, very soon, people want to tweak its functionality, get features that are only useful to them and perhaps a small number of people. Quark has its XTensions, for example, and around that idea a thriving market emerged. And Adobe Photoshop supports plug-ins. "/>
			<outline text="The list is finite but large. There are lots of developer platforms floating in the software world. To focus all the attention on Microsoft is to miss the point. Finding the right mixture of room for developer play and off-the-shelf utility has always been the challenge, not just for operating systems, for every kind of software."/>
			<outline text="If you support a plug-in architecture, you have to supply source code to show the developers how to do it. Everywhere you see plug-ins you'll find an open source tradition. Plug-ins can't get going without sample source."/>
			<outline text="***Scripting"/>
			<outline text="It's even more common than that. Where ever there is an application scripting tradition, such as on the Mac and Windows, there is also a tradition of free source code to show you how to script an application."/>
			<outline text="Few of the Unix advocates come from the Mac or Windows scripting worlds, they probably don't know that the tradition even exists, but it does, and much of  the learning has already happened, and the people are spreading out."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I downloaded a copy of WinZip 7.0, and guess what, it has a scripting interface. No sample source code. Ooops! (I'll figure it out.)"/>
			<outline text="***Apache, Linux and Perl"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, many customers don't want to fuss with source code."/>
			<outline text="The first time I went looking for Apache for Windows, all I could find was the C source code and instructions on how to build it. I was upset. Even though I'm a developer, and could probably figure it out, who has the time? I just wanted a web server. It's like going to a restaurant to order a great meal, and having the waiter take you to the kitchen to show you how to cook it for yourself. Sheez, that's not why I came here. I want you to serve me. I'll pay the bill, with pleasure, for services rendered."/>
			<outline text="Of course after a little searching, I found the binary for Apache, installed it and a half-hour later I was running a web server. (An aside, Microsoft's IIS takes a skilled system engineer half a day to set up, and even then it might not work, so Apache has an advantage they could be pushing more, and Microsoft still has work to do. A gentle hint to both competitors.)"/>
			<outline text="As the stars of the open source world, Apache, Linux and Perl, move out into the commercial world, as they are clearly going to do, they will have to behave more like commercial software. Sure, some people *love* the idea of being able to see and tweak the source, and some people already have overflowing lives, and just want the functionality, and would happy to pay for it."/>
			<outline text="***How Windows Developers Think"/>
			<outline text="Which brings me to the point of this piece. Windows pretty much defines the market for customers who want things to work out of the box. If Linux wants this market, then it must do a better job of working out of the box. And if Windows wants to stay strong, it also must do a better job of working out of the box."/>
			<outline text="As a Windows developer it would be great for my business if Microsoft released the source for Windows. It means that the bugs would probably get fixed faster. We would probably find new ways of integrating functionality faster. And it would also mean that Windows emulators on other platforms would finally work really well. I'm not saying Microsoft should do it, I can see lots of problems, but I want to be clear that it might make their developer story stronger if they did."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, because the Windows market is so large, and because historically it has depended so much on Microsoft engineering, there are huge opportunities to make it work better. To be sure that this opportunity is realized in the market, a change in attitude at Microsoft would have to come, but the timing looks good because of competition from the open source world and because of the legal situation in Washington."/>
			<outline text="My call: it's worth an investment. I've now been using Windows as my primary platform for a year. It no longer seems weird to me. We have a lot of stuff working and have lots more ideas."/>
			<outline text="At the same time, Microsoft is under more pressure and receiving more scrutiny than ever before. I believe this is good for Windows developers. How could the current legal situation *not* make Microsoft more aware of how their actions impact smaller developers working on the Windows platform? "/>
			<outline text="So that explains my position. I have a strong interest in the vibrancy of the Windows market. And I also have a strong interest in having access to that market without having to go thru the platform vendor."/>
			<outline text="***My strategy"/>
			<outline text="I am not a gorilla. I have a very small company and a very small customer base, compared to the bases for Windows or for Linux. Lots of room for growth if I play the game smart."/>
			<outline text="I don't play the Embrace and Extend strategy, it's not appropriate for a player of my size. My strategy is different. I make friends. My success or failure, in business, is determined by the extent that I can cement friendships in the form of software that works with other software."/>
			<outline text="An example. On the Mac we have a great development relationship with the developers of BBEdit, the leading tool for editing HTML text on the Mac OS. Frontier and BBEdit act as a team, giving web developers the best text editing tool coupled with the best web content framework, providing a result that neither product could deliver on its own. This isn't news, we did this a long time ago, and reaped the benefits. In an upcoming release of BBEdit we hope to do it again."/>
			<outline text="Another example, again on the Mac, is the relationship between Frontier and the leading web server, WebSTAR. We worked closely with the development team, and found lots of ways we could deliver the power of both environments thru an HTTP interface. These features became standards, and are supported by all web servers and content environments on the Mac. "/>
			<outline text="We can do it again, with a broader view now that we're also on Windows. Websites are LANs. Thru HTTP and XML we can build incredible bridges that cross environments. We have our hooks into the Microsoft developer world, probably more than any of the Unix-centered tools and environments can, because this is our focus. Over time we will have more hooks, and we hope to even play a role in defining new system-level hooks. "/>
			<outline text="So here's my offer to the Linux, Apache and Perl worlds. We need a standard runtime environment for dynamic websites that we can target from our Mac and Windows content management system. That involves all three of the lions of the Linux world. Apache does the serving, Perl does the computation and Linux makes it all work."/>
			<outline text="***Choice"/>
			<outline text="If I can participate in building a bridge between Mac/Windows and Unix, I can be safe from Microsoft, because I can deliver a benefit that some customers will want: Choice. "/>
			<outline text="No doubt there are huge numbers of people who want all-Microsoft solutions, that's why this strategy is no threat to Microsoft, at least not at this time."/>
			<outline text="As a Windows developer, attempting to speak for other Windows developers, what we want is to bridge out from our base. It's in our interest to see Linux gain traction because it creates a two-party system, and focuses on customer choice. This is where us little guys fit in, in providing choices to the customers who value choice."/>
			<outline text="To the Unix folks, please stop focusing all your attention on Microsoft and look to possible friendships with people who work inside Windows, but who don't work for Microsoft. We can help each other because our interests are aligned."/>
			<outline text="I believe that to some extent, even the most loyal all-Microsoft shop wants protection against vendor lock-in. I alluded to this in my last &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/11/howMicrosoftThinks.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;. This is the germ of power in the Internet, the idea that choice is precious. You can't cement the power of the Internet with polarizing speeches and white papers about Cathedrals and Bazaars, it can only happen by erasing the lines, opening the doors, building and delivering compatibility, making it easier and then even easier, and letting the customers choose."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Perl is not the only powerful scripting language that came from Unix. I know about Python and Tcl and respect them enormously. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: Many people don't know what Kool Aid is. It's a cheap soft drink that members of the People's Temple drank, with poison, to kill themselves. The first time I heard this expression was from people I knew at General Magic. It goes like this: I Drank the Kool Aid. Kind of like Going Down With The Ship. Hopefully you get the idea."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: A bunch of people asked me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$1010&quot;&gt;outline my proposal&lt;/a&gt; more specifically, so I did."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/12/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="All of a sudden a judge in Washington is trying to figure out whether Microsoft sabotaged Apple's QuickTime for Windows. "/>
			<outline text="But the other side of the question isn't coming out. Did Apple do everything they could to work around problems they were encountering in Windows? "/>
			<outline text="Did Apple thoroughly test their software in Microsoft's web browser, or did they rely on Microsoft's claim of Netscape compatibility?"/>
			<outline text="Did Apple have other avenues to explore before making it an anti-trust issue, even if Microsoft was blowing them off? "/>
			<outline text="Did Apple check with other plug-in developers to see how they had worked around similar problems? "/>
			<outline text="The trial also raises an ethical question. Can a platform vendor do things to favor their own software over developer's software? "/>
			<outline text="And does the platform vendor have to work with everyone who wants to make software for the platform? "/>
			<outline text="***How an Apple Developer Thinks"/>
			<outline text="It is possible to deliver commercial quality software for a popular operating system without having a cordial relationship with the platform vendor. Every Mac developer knows about this. For many years Apple didn't answer the phone for anyone. The fact that there is a healthy base of content development apps for the Macintosh is proof that you don't need any help from the platform vendor."/>
			<outline text="You do it by bonding with other developers, sharing information and best practices, and stepping thru the code in a debugger to see how the OS is mangling your software, and figure out how to work around that. "/>
			<outline text="Every step of the way you share info with other developers, for two reasons. First, they may shorten your development cycle (been there done that) or second, you can pave the way for the next guy to come thru the problem area. You leave a trail behind you when dealing with compatibility issues. The more open and visible that trail, the more support you'll get from other developers."/>
			<outline text="It's a good defensive position to take, and developers need good defensive positions. If we all work around the problem the same way, when the platform vendor breaks me, they also break you. Or on the positive side, if they test a new rev of the system with your software and not with mine, I'm still covered. No developer likes to be left standing alone when a new version of the system software breaks apps or system extensions."/>
			<outline text="As a developer, I know that software has bugs, and I've learned that it's the developer's responsibility to work around bugs in the OS, even if the the OS vendor deliberately put the problem in my way. Sometimes a change in the OS only breaks one *kind* of app. Is that a competitive move? Sometimes it can be, it certainly feels that way when it happens to you. But it's certainly not a matter to be decided as part of an anti-trust case, not unless all other reasonable avenues have been explored, and only if it's very clear that the software would have succeeded if the platform vendor hadn't interefered."/>
			<outline text="Taking it to court, where there aren't any plug-in developers that can help them, makes me think Apple isn't serious about QuickTime for Windows. It's Apple's job to make QuickTime work in the environments they want it to work in. I bet Microsoft still works around bugs in the Mac OS. We all do it. It's a fact of life, it's an imperfect world and software has bugs, even operating systems from big companies, especially operating systems from big companies."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I'd like to understand what happened. If possible, I'd like to find and speak with the Apple engineer on this project, find out what the problem was, then get that on the web, in public, and ask other developers with experience working on Windows browser plug-ins for MSIE to comment. "/>
			<outline text="It's too late to prevent the embarassment for our industry, the embarassment that comes from being so ineffective at working with each other that we have to bring our problems to the government. This isn't exclusively Microsoft's problem, it's a problem for our whole industry. Apple is the last company I'd expect to be pointing this particular finger. Historically, they're so bad at working with others when the shoe is on the other foot, when they're the platform vendor standing in the way of the developers. "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I'd like to be a force for good here. Let's show Apple that they can rely on other developers to help solve these kinds of technical problems. If they're in it for the long haul, they must have a stake in a system that works."/>
			<outline text="Working together we can make QuickTime for Windows work really well, why shouldn't it, and we can help make the Mac platform even healthier through more cooperation between the platform vendor (Apple) and Mac developers."/>
			<outline text="Let's work together."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: How about an XML parser system extension for the Mac OS? Is anyone working on that? The Mac has to be part of XML and vice versa. The customers want it, just ask the Seybold people."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Remember BOGU? We all have to do it. That message is for both Microsoft and Apple. I think Microsoft is closer to getting it because they used to do it so well. Apple has, in my opinion, never practiced BOGU. It's good for you. A little humility and even subservience makes better software. It's a yin-yang thing."/>

			<outline text="The best message came from Norm Meyrowitz, a top executive at Macromedia. He said that the next releases of two of their mainstays, Director and Dreamweaver, would both do XML beautifully and do it on both Mac and Windows."/>
			<outline text="This is expansive. It means that we will be able to create distributed content management networks, over HTTP, where Macs and Windows machines can be intermixed, as total peers, each doing the things they do best, or the things that the users prefer. Writers, designers, animators and system managers, each doing their thing, each using the OS they like to use."/>

			<outline text="Am I wrong and is everyone else right? (Some people are nodding right now.)"/>
			<outline text="No, I'm not wrong, but I'm not right either. And neither are you. And I'm not an apologist for Microsoft. People who think so are taking a shortcut and are depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn something new."/>
			<outline text="***It's not that simple"/>
			<outline text="Few issues are so simple as to allow me to be fully pro something or anti something else. I am against capital punishment, but I understand the sorrow and rage one feels when a relative is murdered. I am in favor of abortion rights, but I understand the ethical dilemma. To arrive at my positions, I do a lot of thinking, balancing issues, considering alternatives, and being flexible. For a lot of issues, rigidity gets you further from a decision, not closer."/>
			<outline text="Like everyone else I have something called a point of view. And I am flexible. If things change, and I want to change, I let it happen. I try not to dig my heels in against change."/>
			<outline text="If Apple makes an accusation, it should be examined. Same if Netscape does. Does that make me pro-Microsoft? Hardly. If Microsoft screwed Apple, you'll hear about it here first, with facts to back up the assertion. But, Apple has not provided enough information, or access to their engineer. Does that make me anti-Apple? No, it says nothing about me, other than I have an open mind and want more facts."/>
			<outline text="People who say my last piece was anti-Apple should look again. I offered them a way to get QuickTime solidly on Windows. And I offered to help them turn the Mac platform into a vibrant system with lots of new apps. This is not an anti-Apple stance. If you want to win in the software business you have to be ready to cooperate, to accept a gift, at a moment's notice. Apple clearly isn't there yet. I hope they get there soon because there's a lot of cool stuff we can do."/>
			<outline text="My opinion: Save the silver bullets for real scary situations, like security holes in web servers, electronic privacy issues, junk email, Microsoft subverting WORA, or locking hardware OEMs into Windows. Or the nuclear missles that could launch on 1/1/00. Keep a sense of perspective. "/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="***Think"/>
			<outline text="Just because Apple says Microsoft done them wrong doesn't mean it's so. We have to look at facts to determine what's true. Constantly re-evaluate your beliefs as new information becomes available. Think think think. "/>
			<outline text="As a software developer, and a member of the software industry, I have a stake in the outcome of the trial in Washington DC. So I think about it, what do I want to happen, and is that what's happening?"/>
			<outline text="Here's what I think. The software industry is a ethical cesspool run by self-proclaimed leaders each with an emotional age that can be measured in single digits. To single out Microsoft is unfair, ridiculous and counter-productive. "/>
			<outline text="It's even worse. The most vocal people on the Internet tend to be even more mired in the cesspool. Think it thru. If everything Microsoft ever does is bad, then how can you win? What if they did nothing wrong, or, even more extreme for some, what if they did something good? Could you even see it? If you don't show any flexibility in your point of view, there's no point discussing anything with you."/>
			<outline text="My last few pieces have been about thinking. It's the most important thing we can do right now. Think about the important things. Think about the things you want."/>
			<outline text="***What do you want?"/>
			<outline text="I ask the people who line up against Microsoft, what do you want? What's your vision? What will you do if Microsoft is defeated in court? Will you treat your customers and developers better than Microsoft treats its customers and developers? I'd like to hear about that."/>
			<outline text="I think there has to be a two-way BOGU for the crisis to end. Microsoft's attackers must stop asking for special treatment, and they must stop engaging Microsoft at the level they engage Microsoft, and start working to fix their own problems, to help others fix theirs, to grow into the role they envision for themselves instead of asking for a handout."/>
			<outline text="And on the other side, Microsoft must change. What do they want? Some of it they can have, and other stuff they can't. If they want the rest of the industry to get out of their way, they have to get out of the way of the rest of the industry."/>
			<outline text="In other words, it's time for disarmament, on both sides."/>
			<outline text="***After the anger subsides"/>
			<outline text="How will this be resolved? People are very angry, both at Microsoft and elsewhere. I get a lot of flames. OK, so after the anger subsides, what do you want? "/>

			<outline text="Does Microsoft have a right to exist?"/>
			<outline text="Yes they do. How do I know? Because they *do* exist. Just like the Palestinians do, as do the Israelis. People who are anti-Microsoft are anti-reality. They're here. The government is not going to kill them, any more than it's going to kick out Bill Clinton. It doesn't work that way. You can stop dreaming now."/>

			<outline text="They are. They exist. "/>
			<outline text="The more you oppose what exists, the more powerless you are. It's a good way to get nowhere. To everyone who wants Microsoft to go away, the key to your power is in giving up on that. Embrace Microsoft. Be glad they're here. Now work around them. Do things that make *you* powerful. To Microsoft, the next time that happens, don't mess with it."/>

Sun is a miserable immature company, I wouldn't vote for them to lead the industry, I'd rather go sailing on the Mediterranean or make pottery. But the Sun slogan resonated with thousands of developers, who want choice, they don't want to be locked into Microsoft system software. Same here. The day Microsoft embraces WORA and the philosophy of choice behind it, their troubles will be over."/>

			<outline text="Then a conclusion that can help put the Microsoft trials in perspective. "/>
			<outline text="What's on trial are the practices of the software industry. "/>
			<outline text="This clicked for me when I read an InfoWorld report on the testimony of an IBM exec explaining how Microsoft stood in the way of the success of IBM's OS/2 operating system."/>
			<outline text="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?981117.wcsoyring.htm "/>
			<outline text="Perhaps I'm cursed by too-long a memory, but I remember a time when IBM was the 10-ton gorilla, blindly pushing their own solutions over everyone else's. "/>
			<outline text="So Microsoft inherited this role, for whatever reason, now they're the blind 10-ton gorilla. And IBM is arguing the case we all could have made against *them* prior to the early 90s. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's argument, the software industry is very competitive, makes sense compared against the experience of IBM. Microsoft's weakness today was IBM's weakness in the 80s. It's their size and their belief that all-in-one is a sustainable long-term strategy in the software industry. Microsoft's claim that technology moves too fast to support that strategy is accurate. "/>
			<outline text="IBM is still a larger company than Microsoft, by a lot. In other words the message isn't in the numbers. The status of gorillahood has more to do with being the default choice than having the biggest bottom line. "/>
			<outline text="But, as I've repeated many times in DaveNet, eventually such hegemonies break, new technology becomes possible, the default choice (today Microsoft) tries to own it, and they get left behind."/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates, a student of this stuff, is caught playing a game he can't take any further than he already has. The government and his competitors are volunteering to be the scapegoats for his downfall, but the seeds are planted, it's going to happen anyway."/>
			<outline text="Is it fair to Gates and Microsoft? Maybe not. It's unfair to change the rules after there is a clear winner. But that's not the point. The game must go on. We all have to deal with a limited understanding of why things happen and why each of us is cast in the role we are cast in. We all have to deal with our inability to control the world. "/>
			<outline text="Some of us rise higher before we hit the limit. Gates and Microsoft are the latest to hit the ceiling. They have no choice but to ungroup and divest, and it'll be good for them, because it will bring them more in line with the way the tide is flowing, and has been flowing, for the last few years."/>
			<outline text="***A generational thing"/>
			<outline text="The seeds of the downfall of the gorilla strategy is that we all grow older, and new people come along, and they have no vested interest in the rules of our world, and they break the rules, to their advantage. "/>
			<outline text="I first learned about this when I was a teenager in New York City. A friend, we called him Crazy John, liked to build radio transmitters. One day he showed us a machine that would broadcast over WABC-AM, the number one radio station in NY for teens. His transmitter would replace the station over much of the borough of Queens and be in motion, in a car, so the triangulation machines owned by the FCC couldn't find him."/>
			<outline text="I said &quot;But John this is illegal. You need a license to do that.&quot; He said &quot;I wasn't even born when they gave out the licenses.&quot; What an interesting way to view things. I remembered this idea for many many years."/>
			<outline text="I remember how we took advantage of our elders in the early 80s when PCs took over from mainframes and minicomputers. The old folks were blind to what we were doing. We took over from them, leaving companies like IBM and DEC caught in a little strategic puddle that used to appear to be the whole ocean."/>
			<outline text="Today's 20-year-old was born in 1978. When he or she was three years old, the IBM PC shipped. The Mac shipped at age six. And Windows 3.0 shipped at age 12. They have a different attitude about computers. The Fear part of FUD doesn't work as well on them, because PCs are just as ordinary for them as TVs were for people of my generation when we were growing up."/>
			<outline text="Technology rewrites the rules every generation. It may not be possible now to sustain a gorilla even for a few years. The first warning sign is largeness. When a single entity becomes so large that it believes it controls technology, or acts as if it does, or tries to, it should do a self-imposed breakup. To wait for the government to intervene is to have waited too long."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is so big today that they make a lot of decisions to pacify the gorilla, not responding to needs of the market. I think the creative people at Microsoft are just as limited by the gorilla as anyone outside of Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="Gates and I are of the same generation, I'm just a few months older than he is. Many of the reporters are of our generation. So are the leaders of most of the other major technology companies. It's strange, but I think we all have a stake in his continuing to play the gorilla role. I think we lie to ourselves when we think otherwise."/>
			<outline text="But the young folks can and probably will do to us what we did to our old folks when we were young. It happens every twenty years or so, whether we're ready for it or not."/>
			<outline text="***Bill the brazen"/>
			<outline text="Read this interview with Bill Gates, one year ago, before all the court cases started."/>
			<outline text="http://www.news.com/SpecialFeatures/0,5,14704,00.html "/>
			<outline text="He was so brazen, so unafraid of being open with his point of view. So few people in the software business are this open in their thinking. But Bill Gates, in 1997, had nothing to fear, no reason not to tell us what was on his mind and how he views the world. "/>
			<outline text="If you read nothing else, read the CNET interview. It's far more revealing and more relevant than the Halloween memos, which only revealed the thinking of a few Microsoft programmers, not the CEO and founder and leader of the company."/>
			<outline text="Maybe I'm swept up in the times, maybe he will be the one to make the shift into the next stage of gorillahood, maybe I'm missing something. But people are people, Microsoft sure has some smart ones, but they have so many people, it all kind of averages out."/>
			<outline text="I think we're almost at an inflection point, when the slope of the curve changes directions again. Maybe this time there will be no gorilla (I hope so) and maybe this time the old folks don't have to stand in the way of the young. That would truly be an accomplishment, a sign that things are getting better, that the leading edge of technology can be a place where change and creativity are embraced, not held back."/>

			<outline text="Maybe there are other places where people aren't so petty? Maybe it's time for me to make some new electronic friends.

			<outline text="1. The press is discounting the value of the web browser in this deal. It's not clear to me whether they understand the central role that Netscape engineers are playing in the open source development of the browser. The execs at AOL are creative, I doubt if they discount it. "/>
			<outline text="2. If operating systems are not that important anymore and web content and e-commerce are the market for the next N years, has AOL already sewn it up? As I pointed out several times in the past, Netscape could have merged with any number of other companies to provide fertilizer that enhances a less lively parent company. At this moment, the AOL deal is exactly the right deal. "/>
			<outline text="3. Will AOL place value on relations with web developers? Can they manage the relationship with developers more effectively than Netscape could? One thing is for sure, Microsoft can do this, and is doing it.

As a web developer myself, I wonder how AOL wants me to think about this deal. "/>

			<outline text="Back to more mundane everyday accomplishments!"/>
			<outline text="Quietly we've been testing a new runtime environment for our websites at UserLand. In early October we started the new Discussion Group, which is merely an HTML interface for the broader content management system that has been at the core of Frontier since mid-1996."/>
			<outline text="Behind the scenes there's a document database and rendering system, with lots of ways to flow content into it. We're starting to publish XML interfaces for this database, to allow authors to connect to the system without using a web browser, and eventually without using our editorial tools. "/>

			<outline text="I only have time this morning for a very short piece. It's been going that way more and more lately. Writing for the web has taken a back seat to writing software for the web. But today we received a very noteworthy honor which is very visionary, very indicative of where we're going with our software and why we're so excited about it, and I can't let it pass without commenting."/>
			<outline text="***Jakob Nielsen"/>
			<outline text="This week's AlertBox column by Jakob Nielsen asks an interesting question. If you were Bill Gates, where would you be shopping for new ideas for The Internet Desktop? Interestingly, this is exactly what we've been thinking about at UserLand. And it's very gratifying that Nielsen tuned into that, and honored us with placement on his list of technologies that he would buy if he were Bill Gates."/>
			<outline text="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/981213.html "/>
			<outline text="That's a high honor indeed!"/>
			<outline text="***Desktops are important"/>
			<outline text="In the rush to the web, we lost sight that the web is still a nascent application platform, it's much less sophisticated than the GUIs that evolved in the seventies and eighties. Bruce Tognazzini, an early Apple UI guru, has written about this. I've heard that Steve Capps, one of the original Mac developers and now at Microsoft is also working in this area. And in Frontier 6, coming in a few months, we will close the loop for web authoring, fully integrating it with the Windows/Mac desktop environment and all the powerful and deep writing and graphic tools that are there, but not easily connected to the web, yet."/>
			<outline text="I have been writing about this, but most of the writing is very technical, and therefore I'm only publishing it on the website. I feel that without context, it wouldn't make much sense to DaveNet readers. But when we finish this project, the result will be very understandable. When you're looking at a page that you authored, there will be a big unmissable button that says Edit this Page. When you click the button, the document is wrapped in XML and sent to your desktop, where it opens in an editing window, ready for you to edit it. It could be a GIF or JPEG or a Director movie or Flash sequence, or more likely an essay, story, business plan, report or other text document. If you have an editor for the document, we'll try to find it, and open it for you."/>
			<outline text="When you're finished editing, bring the web browser to the front and click on the Save on Server button. There it is, that's how the web and the desktop are integrated for multi-user authoring. For now, I don't believe it can possibly get easier or give you more leverage. And it gives you the power of the deep apps that run on the desktop, PhotoShop, Illustrator, FreeHand, Word, BBEdit, Dreamweaver, Director, etc. There are no counterparts to these apps written in Java or DHTML, nor is it likely, IMHO, that there ever will. "/>
			<outline text="To make this work has meant elevating the whole Frontier environment. XML and XML-RPC were absolutely necessary. COM and Apple Event support. ODBC and support for Windows scripting APIs. And new work in editorial tools that's actually a loop back to the work we did in the 80s on outlining, word processing and presentations."/>
			<outline text="It's all summarized in this slide show:"/>
			<outline text="http://iis.userland.com/slideshows/Nirvana/slide01.html "/>
			<outline text="***Thin workstation model"/>
			<outline text="I find it interesting that that even though I don't like how Scott McNealy and Larry Ellison play in the software business, that I have at least partially embraced their vision. My workstation isn't as thin as theirs, not by a lot, and I have a deep investment in C apps, and so do the other content tools companies, Adobe, Macromedia, Quark, et al, and I want to continue that investment, not abandon it as they would ask me to. "/>
			<outline text="I resisted the temptation to throw it all away for Java, and I'm glad I did. The industry goes thru these gyrations from time to time, and in the end, the money is where the users are. In this case, it requires a small bit of connective technology, XML-RPC, to turn the popular content tools into networked applications. That's where we've been working, and we're starting to reap the benefits."/>
			<outline text="***Desktop creativity apps"/>
			<outline text="It was time to say this, however quickly, because Nielsen has totally tuned into what we're doing. Whether we sell to Microsoft or some other large company is a separate issue. I am committed to seeing this software to market in as effective a way as I possibly can. I'm not in a hurry to get VC money or do an IPO or to sell out, these could be very distracting and could lessen, not increase the chance of our success. "/>
			<outline text="I think when the dust settles, the vision we're implementing will be the common practice, that the web will be seen as groupware, and it will be easy to create for, and the popular desktop creativity apps will be networked just as the reading apps (the web browsers) are."/>
			<outline text="So now I have to get back to programming.. See you on the web!"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/15/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="To those who wish that I would stay away from US politics, you may choose to not read this piece. As a US citizen, I have something to say. I'm not hearing it on TV, or reading it on the web or in newspapers. I'm not a Democrat or a Republican, you can be sure this is not partisan politics. I am just me, nothing more."/>
			<outline text="It's easy to get wound up and confused in the Clinton quagmire. More than the public inquest into Clarence Thomas's sexuality in 1991, this one directly questions the political stability of the United States. What is it built on and how strong is that foundation? What has to be covered up, swept aside, in order for us to remain intact as a country?"/>
			<outline text="***In September"/>
			<outline text="In late September, I wrote a piece &quot;We'll Keep Clinton&quot;. I've changed my mind. Impeachment is the way to go. Enough is enough. The issue is not going to go away, nor should it. "/>
			<outline text="***Sexual harassment"/>
			<outline text="A generation ago we decided that sexual harassment is a crime. "/>
			<outline text="We decided to rise above a system where powerful people could demand sex of subordinates. "/>
			<outline text="We decided to focus on merit and excellence, not sexual willingness. "/>
			<outline text="We decided to weed out sexual corruption from our professional lives by criminalizing it."/>
			<outline text="***Clinton was accused"/>
			<outline text="Clinton was accused of sexual harassment, not with Lewinsky, with Jones and then Willey. That should be pause for thought on its own. But it went further, he lied about it. He thwarted justice. He evaded prosecution. He lied and induced others to lie. "/>
			<outline text="Not until Joseph Lieberman, a Democratic Senator from Connecticut called him on the lies, did he stop spinning and diflecting and accusing. "/>
			<outline text="At one point Clinton said his fate was in the hands of others. He would shut up and let the Congress decide his fate. That was a good idea. But, with the polls on his side (how many of them vote?) now he's back, lobbying and spinning. "/>
			<outline text="Yesterday Al Gore preached about the wisdom of the American people. This was the most insulting part, a preview of what's to come. They think they have us. Back to business as usual."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday Clinton said he hasn't even thought about resigning. Hasn't even crossed his mind. Are you kidding? On it's face it's a lie. If you don't get it, think about this. It would be like me saying right now that it never crossed my mind to type this essay into my computer. Well, what am I doing right now?"/>
			<outline text="The specific charges, perjury and obstruction of justice, are the small picture. The big picture is that we elected a man who has contempt for our intelligence and vision. He depends on us to ignore the blatant contradictions. He lies, it's his lifestyle, and we accept it. No big deal, some say, but the lies are negating accusations of criminal behavior, and to me at least, make him look more and more guilty of the sexual harassment he was accused of."/>
			<outline text="***Did he do it?"/>
			<outline text="The question, now long forgotten, was and is, is he a sexual harasser? Would we remove a president who used his office in the practice of sexual crimes? Well, you tell me. Would you? "/>
			<outline text="Long before it was a matter before the US Congress, it was being considered in the courts. It was *his* choice to get in the way of that process. That it's come to this, impeachment, is his doing, not ours, and not the Republicans."/>
			<outline text="So many smart, otherwise caring people, seem to overlook this. He was charged with doing something reprehensible. He lied to protect himself. If you can forgive that, can you forgive him for pressuring other people to lie to protect him? Isn't this how sexual harassment gets overlooked, how it gets buried, forgotten, and the crimes are allowed to continue?"/>
			<outline text="***Who comes first?"/>
			<outline text="We are going thru a national grieving, that's for sure. There's no way to put this behind us without looking at why it happened. And I encourage you to look deeper than the flaws of one person, or the politics of Congress, or the legalities of impeachment. Look at the moral character of each of us as voters. When we elected Clinton what were we saying about ourselves and our aspirations for our country?"/>
			<outline text="We were saying, in my humble opinion, that we want a country built on lies. We elected an architect of lies, a craftsman, a tale spinner, a little boy who smiles and asks for our approval even though he's lying and we know it. This goes all the way back to &quot;I didn't inhale.&quot; Who cares if a child of the sixties smoked pot. But why did we elect a man who lies about it?"/>
			<outline text="***Sexual McCarthyism"/>
			<outline text="The Sexual McCarthyism argument is another insult, more spin bullshit. "/>
			<outline text="If he had a happy sex life I'd be the first to congratulate him. That would be quite an accomplishment. But that's not what we're talking about. "/>
			<outline text="Again, it's about sexual violence, one step short of rape. And it happened on the job, probably many times, in the workplace we collectively own, the White House."/>
			<outline text="Such matters are always public, whether the accused is a President or a Supreme Court nominee, or a random employee somewhere in America."/>
			<outline text="***He could resign"/>
			<outline text="I'm fed up with this country. It's time for us to grow up, take responsibility, get back on track. We are losers. That's what Clinton says about us. I'm fed up with people who say we can't elect a different kind of leader. We have the power. We're at an inflection point. Big change is here. I hate powerlessness. Use your power. Now it's time for thought and vision. What do you want for our country? "/>
			<outline text="Please look beyond the issues of one sad example of an American. He doesn't matter. That's what I want Clinton to say and for us to accept. The only realistic act of contrition, the only way for us to go forward before his term expires, is for Clinton to show a tiny bit of pride in his country, to put it first, to step out of the way, and let us all move on. He won't do it, so we have to do it ourselves."/>
			<outline text="This is not a quick judgement. We've had our noses firmly planted in his horrendous integrity at least since January, and I believe, much longer. "/>
			<outline text="***We own him"/>
			<outline text="To the Congress, please please impeach him. For us and for perpetuity. The President needs to know that we own him, not vice versa. If he lies, we may forgive, but he has to ask for forgiveness. He's still arguing. He's still lying. Teach him and all that follow that we're tough when it comes to the truth. "/>
			<outline text="To the rest of American electorate that chooses lies, you're selling us out. If you think the lying was bad before, just wait, if he gets off clean, it's going to be really disgusting. And not just with this President, with all future Presidents. The spin doctors, the professional liars, are recalculating right now. It could get much worse. "/>
			<outline text="The solution is in our hands right now. Support Congress. They're doing the right thing for once. Let Clinton's trial be a confirmation that the truth matters. We have no more important business. Clinton could have relied on our goodness, our generosity, our wisdom, instead he's appealing to our powerlessness. I hate being lied to by an employee. I won't stand for it. Will you?"/>
			<outline text="***The much larger picture"/>
			<outline text="And finally, since sexual harassment is largely a male versus female crime, please think about a young woman, a daughter or niece will do, and explain to her why it doesn't matter that Clinton obstructed justice to keep from being punished for committing a serious sexual crime."/>
			<outline text="By overlooking Clinton's dishonesty we become complicit. When he says the truth doesn't matter, and you agree, you're saying we can never be better than we are. To me, these things matter, they really do."/>

			<outline text="Good morning DaveNet readers!"/>
			<outline text="It's late December, for sure. It's cold cold cold in the Bay Area. It's winter, but not our winter. Somehow it got lost and we got Colorado's weather instead! Brrrr. Please, if you're in California, stay warm. "/>
			<outline text="It's a good time to be hibernating. Music on the box, more sad James Taylor tunes. He misses everyone, even before they're gone! "/>
			<outline text="Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby, go on and tell me lies but hold me tight. Save your goodbyes for the morning light, but don't let me be lonely tonight. Hmmmm. He's so sad!"/>
			<outline text="Hey even on a cold day it's OK to put on some warm clothes and go for a walk, watch your breath, be happy that your coat is warm the sky is clear. Test your vision. Go to the top of a hill and have a look. "/>
			<outline text="What do I see?"/>
			<outline text="***A cynical generation"/>
			<outline text="I was born in 1955. I grew up in the sixties and early seventies. With hindsight, had I been just one year older I would have been drafted to fight in Vietnam. Instead I wrote, rallied and rebelled. I did the best I could to fight the government with the limited resources available to a teenager. It was frightening to be a young man in those times, with so little experience to base decisions on, and if you made the wrong decision, you could die."/>
			<outline text="Washington not only lied to us, they tried to kill us, and they were successful with 50,000 men of my generation, gone, dead, their lives ended. As they say, people died for our freedom, and it's not always the way they tell it in the history books."/>
			<outline text="It was a humiliating death. We were old enough to die for our country, but we weren't old enough to vote. It was time for the previous generation to go, and they didn't go easily. They killed a lot of people on their way out, not just young Americans, but far-away people of all ages in southeast Asia."/>
			<outline text="***A fearful power"/>
			<outline text="The men who died in Vietnam gave us the power to tune out on Washington. They played a big role in the downfall of Nixon. They were the marker for how horrible power in Washington could be. So we got rid of Nixon, and subsequent Presidents were refinements of the answer to Nixon, people we could tune out on, the well-intentioned nice guy. Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and now Clinton."/>
			<outline text="Successively better airbrushed, more and more tuned to polls, fighting for the center, telling us what they think we want to hear, trying to nudge the numbers up, but not relying on the minds of the electorate. They were smart not to rely on our minds, because there was no evidence that we wanted to use our minds."/>
			<outline text="Now I think, I hope, we're at the end of that road. My generation, Clinton's generation, is running this country. We can be forgiven for our cynicism. Why would we look to Washington for leadership? Best not to look. We take drugs, watch TV, and fall deeper and deeper asleep. It's not that Clinton lies, we lie. We say we're alive, but are we? "/>
			<outline text="***A funny fascination"/>
			<outline text="I listened to the House debate on Saturday after tuning into the committee hearings over the previous few weeks. I was struck by the formality and ingrained respect in the words they use. &quot;I rise to speak!&quot; they say (except on the committee where they remain seated)."/>
			<outline text="I found myself fascinated, much as an employee would be fascinated to snoop on a boardroom discussion. I imagine that like me, most Americans had no idea what a congressional debate sounds like. We could all learn a lot from this. I may be your opponent, I may be at war with you, but my words are stronger and more powerful if they are presented with respect for our mutual intelligence and integrity."/>
			<outline text="How differently they talk among themselves. The same people who spew spin on Larry King actually make a lot of sense when they rise to speak their cause in Congress."/>
			<outline text="***What will history say?"/>
			<outline text="The New York Times published an excellent reconstruction of the events that lead to the impeachment. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/122198impeach-reconstruct.html "/>
			<outline text="This is great fodder for the historians. Watching CNN, PBS and CNBC over the last few days I find the stories told by scholarly historians most interesting. They don't paint the event as a Republican conspiracy. In fact, they're pretty sure that history will say that Clinton played a major role here."/>
			<outline text="The most revealing quote from the Times piece, for me, came from Mike McCurry, until this fall, the White House press secretary. Asked what caused the impeachment he said: &quot;It's a consequence, first and foremost, of the president's appalling behavior.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="It must have been very frustrating to be a member  of the House (or White House) with integrity while Clinton's reckless lying was going on. I totally understand why they voted to impeach. If I had been a House member, I would have voted that way too. If I were McCurry I would have resigned. And if I had voted that way, or resigned, no matter what the polls say, I would have no regrets."/>
			<outline text="***Poll suicide "/>
			<outline text="Oh the Republicans and the Democrats."/>
			<outline text="Saturday we saw two sides locked into their ways and neither of them giving. "/>
			<outline text="The Democrats hurl the nastiest ideas, talking about violence and coups d'etat, Gore still talks about the wisdom of the US electorate. They're still talking in soundbites, leaving everyone to decide which side they're on now that things changed so much. "/>
			<outline text="No one asks for our support directly. It would raise too many contradictions to do so. They talk over our heads to our fear, if we calmed down and pieced together the statements they repeat, over and over, we'd see that they're still lying. They're still doing it. Amazing."/>
			<outline text="I think right now the Republicans are a little ahead of the Democrats, they are deliberately going against the polls, and I totally support them for doing that. The polls encourage childish judgement on the part of voters. They give power to people who don't vote. They shouldn't be encouraged. It's no way to run the country with the biggest bank account. It's no way to run a country with nuclear missles deployed in submarines. "/>
			<outline text="***Think!"/>
			<outline text="Do you think the Republican leadership, in total disarray now, didn't get that they were committing suicide?"/>
			<outline text="I've listened to Henry Hyde talk. I've listened to what he actually says, not what the Democrats say he says. He's stubborn for sure, but he isn't stupid. Here's what he says. Clinton pushed us too far. "/>
			<outline text="That speaks for me. Let's come together on one thing. Integrity matters. Why? There's a high way to live and a powerless way. In our power, a word means something. If I can trust your word, we can work together. "/>
			<outline text="***The people impeach"/>
			<outline text="To me the argument isn't between the Democrats and Republicans, it's between the minds of the people and the government. It was just the luck of the draw that a Democrat was in office when the shit hit the fan. I wouldn't read too much into the partisan differences, I actually think they're irrelevant."/>
			<outline text="Here's the truth, bald and unvarnished. The people impeached Clinton. Read the Constitution for an explanation. Government of the people, by the people, for the people. E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. "/>
			<outline text="It's over, it's done. There's no point arguing whether the acts are impeachable. They are impeachable because impeachment has happened. "/>
			<outline text="***War"/>
			<outline text="Impeachment is war, but it is non-violent. The Democrats who say this is violence are spinning big lies. It's the opposite of violence. "/>
			<outline text="War is shocking. This is definitely war. We are shocked. No surprise there."/>
			<outline text="We truly live in a great country because we can fight a war without killing anyone. That's the most respectful way to do it. We can do it with our minds, expressed through our votes. No need to blow each others' brains out in this war, the Constitution, a totally revolutionary charter, very wisely provides a way to overthrow the government without anyone dying."/>
			<outline text="The war is between minds and mindlessness. Integrity versus lies. Working together versus drifting nowhere. Evolution versus mere survival. Power versus powerlessness."/>
			<outline text="***Integrity"/>
			<outline text="The other side appeals to our wish to go back to sleep. It's as if they have a sign &quot;Please leave your brain at the door.&quot; But the media, TV and the web, also carry a revolutionary message, however briefly and softly. Let's reach higher. Let's wake up and be powerful instead of reveling in our powerlessness."/>
			<outline text="The Vietnam War is over. The generation that gave us all those horrible choices is gone. Our generation is in power now. What's our vision for this country and for the world that we lead? Will we go back to sleep or will we do something wonderful with the chance we have to improve the world?"/>
			<outline text="I'm sure of this. Nothing good can come from tuning out on the issues of our day. And there's no denying that the primary issue is integrity. "/>
			<outline text="***Thinking and vision"/>
			<outline text="This fall I've been focused on thinking and vision as I write a new level of server software running on Windows and Mac. It's unusual, I know, for a software developer to explore these things, but if you want to make software for people with minds, as I do, it pays to study this stuff."/>
			<outline text="Thinking and vision are two undervalued concepts in our age. A thinking mind has a thirst for information, is flexible when new information comes along and has a curiosity to understand how things really work. "/>
			<outline text="Vision is our ability to see. What do you really see? What's really here? And how does it compare to the first impression? In a rush to judgement we shut down our minds. Gut instinct can save your butt in an emergency, but it can also limit vision."/>
			<outline text="***Thinking relates to software"/>
			<outline text="I've written about this a lot. Software forces discipline. You can't debug a program with shoddy thinking. Early last week I found a major bug in the software that had kept me from finishing. The bug had been there for a couple of months. Any day I wanted to find the bug I could have. It wasn't until I got over my fear, rolled up my sleeves and did the research that the bug was revealed, and in an instant, fixed."/>
			<outline text="***People with minds"/>
			<outline text="My market, both as a software developer and a network developer are people with minds. There are already plenty of places to get a dumbed down experience. I want to work with people who enjoy, use, exercise and develop their minds. "/>
			<outline text="In November I said: &quot;Show me where the thinkers are.&quot; "/>

			<outline text="I've been keeping up on the issues of impeachment, reading newspapers and websites, and considering ideas that have not been showing up in these places. I've also been talking with people and listening, and I think people in the US are overlooking something that we may not be able to ignore much longer."/>
			<outline text="First, there is definitely a serious split in this country. Some people blame the Republicans for what happened, I've even heard people say they're so angry with the Republicans that they'll never vote Republican again. To them, I want to say, save some of your rage for Clinton. Understand that there are two sides here."/>
			<outline text="Clinton screwed up, the Republicans responded, and Clinton did more, and on and on. How far has it gone? That's what I want to think about now, logically, precisely, and not emotionally or expressively. And I want to consider other points of view, especially those from outside the US."/>
			<outline text="If we're ever going to work together again, there will have to be give on both sides, sooner or later. We'll have to see ourselves as one country, responsible for what we do, no matter what party you belong to or support."/>
			<outline text="***A tough question"/>
			<outline text="I was going to bag this piece, it's not worth the trouble, I said to myself, until I saw CBS's 60 Minutes last night, and listened to Andy Rooney talk about how far it's gone. He asked the same question I'm going to ask here. "/>

			<outline text="But as I sort thru this, I want to know, where is the crisis? Does Iraq threaten us? If so, how? Oil prices are now lower than they have ever been, as if oil prices were an honorable reason to bomb another country. How would we feel if Iraq had bombed US cities? How would we feel if Iraq found a way to retaliate now that we have bombed their cities? Could we blame them if they did?"/>
			<outline text="Did Israel ask us to bomb Iraq? Clearly if Iraq attacks Israel, that's a problem for Israel, and we're an ally and protector of Israel. Did Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan or Egypt ask us? How come they're staying silent on this? Or are they not silent and we're not hearing about it?"/>
			<outline text="If timing was a big issue, as Clinton says it was, why choose to bomb Iraq just as the House was convening to decide impeachment? Are we to believe that the decision was made without considering impeachment? "/>
			<outline text="At some point in the deliberation, someone must have said &quot;But Mr. President, couldn't this backfire on us? Couldn't it look as if we're doing this to bolster your Presidency?&quot; It's the first question that pops into a thinking mind."/>
			<outline text="The question has barely been raised on TV or in the newspapers or on the web. Why? This is supposed to be an open country. I can't believe that anyone who's really thinking about this hasn't asked themselves this question. It's on my mind, I can tell you that for sure."/>
			<outline text="***Carole King?"/>
			<outline text="These are very strange times."/>
			<outline text="This came home in a new way when I saw a TV clip of Carole King entertaining the troops on a US warship. What was she doing there? Did I miss something? Is this the Bizarro World? Next is it going to be Bob Dylan, Jesse Jackson, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg?"/>
			<outline text="What am I missing? What are we supporting? If you had a debate with a thoughtful person from outside the US, what would you say about how our military is being used? Justly, fairly, wisely, respectfully, honorably? And is it really still just about sex? Can Clinton blame the Republicans for this? Where will the buck stop this time?"/>
			<outline text="The appearance of dishonorable militarism is enough to cause some people to draw their own conclusions. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck.. "/>
			<outline text="***Did you know?"/>
			<outline text="I'm reminded of those who said they knew that Clinton was lying when he said he never had sexual relations with that woman. I wonder if they're listening carefully to his words now. Are they really this gullible? How will you feel if it escalates, and you or your children are asked to fight a war in Iraq? What will you be fighting for?"/>
			<outline text="This is very bad for the US. We are being irresponsible. We let a dishonored president bomb foreign countries and we look the other way. I keep watching the Op-Ed pages for a clue to this, but they are silent. I wonder why?"/>
			<outline text="***A failure to communicate"/>
			<outline text="Over the weekend I watched a great movie, Cool Hand Luke, starring Paul Newman. He's a tragic Christ-like figure, making it an appropriate movie to watch during the big Christian holiday. "/>
			<outline text="He says and does things the other inmates wish they had the courage to say and do. The warden breaks his spirit, but it returns before the movie ends. Cornered, resigned to dying, he repeats, with a twinkle in his eye, what the warden said in an earlier scene. &quot;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&quot; Then the jailkeeper shoots him. As they carry away his dying body I wonder whether it was worth it. "/>
			<outline text="In the end the prisoners are still in prison, but they have the memory of his courage to warm them. Luke is gone, the truth is gone, but at least they had a glimpse of what it's like to be alive."/>
			<outline text="***People with honor"/>
			<outline text="Compared with perjury and obstruction of justice, it matters more to me that the President looked into the camera, with induced outrage, and denied doing something that he later admitted doing. It was his outrage that did it for me. He's an emotional manipulator on a mass scale. Looking at the film of the Cabinet officers saying they believed him, I wondered &quot;How could they?&quot; "/>
			<outline text="If this country ever had courage, now is the time for it to surface. Don't wait for a hero, no one person can do it. We all have to decide if honor counts. Or at least a good portion of the electorate has to get there."/>
			<outline text="The Democrats point to Clinton's historic 70 percent approval rating, and they're right to do so. We preach the value of democracy, but are we hypocrites, do we get any benefit from democracy in our own country? The man lies. Even his supporters acknowledge that. We accept that, but what's the limit? How far will we go? Consider that seriously, as you try to understand the news, as you try to understand the country you live in and how it relates to other countries."/>
			<outline text="If Clinton stays, do we have a system based on lies? None of us know how deep it goes. We may be fighting a war as a by-product of  this, a real war, with battleships and bombs. Don't blame anyone but yourself. You could have stopped it and you still can, it's not too late, yet."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/31/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Here's the 1998 year-in-review website.."/>
			<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/review/ "/>
			<outline text="It's DaveNet in soundbite-form, with links to the original articles. All the blemishes are there, all the too-bold predictions, all the flip-flops. It's a humbling but valuable exercise for me. "/>
			<outline text="But it was fun too. You'll find stories about the Taco Bell dog and Barry Goldwater, Frank Sinatra, Karla Faye Tucker, and even my uncle Sam, and of course Bill Clinton and Bill Gates. The Bees were back, and so was Java. Websites became easier to use. XML got broader, more confusing, and deployed, all in the same year!"/>
			<outline text="***Summing it up"/>
			<outline text="The best most to-the-point quote this year was in the last piece: "/>
			<outline text="&quot;If we're ever going to work together again, there will have to be give on both sides, sooner or later. We'll have to see ourselves as one country, responsible for what we do, no matter what party you belong to or support.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It's funny because that quote works in every part of every story I wrote last year. It's equally true for the United States, for the software industry, between the genders, as well as the Frontier community. "/>
			<outline text="Everywhere at all times, we can look for things we have in common, things we agree on. So often we focus on is how different everyone is. I do it too. But I'm happier when I can see what bonds us together, where our common interests are, which values we share, ways in which we're alike, not different."/>
			<outline text="So let that be my summary for 1998, let's look back on this year as a time when we started working together, or saw why we should work together, and look forward to 1999 and beyond for ways we can do more of that!"/>
