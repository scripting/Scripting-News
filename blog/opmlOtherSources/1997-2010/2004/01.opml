Doc Searls famously told of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; developers and users play in the design of Apple computers. (&quot;The influence of developer will be minimal. The influence of customers and users will be held in even higher contempt.&quot;) It seems the role for voters is similar. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bopnews.com/archives/000238.html&quot;&gt;Chris Lydon tells&lt;/a&gt; of a story that was snuffed during the Carter run to the Democratic nomination in 1976. &quot;I have been unable to discover that you believe in anything other than yourself,&quot; said Carter aide Bob Shrum of Carter, on the record and for attribution. But the editors of the NY Times refused to risk exposing Carter. The last half of the 20th Century was an excessive monoculture, centralized thinking system, where we think, as Citizen Kane &lt;a href=&quot;http://coco.raceme.org/films/citizenkane/quotes.php&quot;&gt;snapped&lt;/a&gt; &quot;What I tell them to think!&quot; The American news executives who deleted the Dean candidacy through misinformation should do as the leadership of the BBC did -- resign and make way for an overdue reformation of journalism, and as a result the American political system. It's time. As Lydon tells us, the corruption isn't new. What's new is that it's visible now that we can inform each other without relying on them." created="Sat, 31 Jan 2004 21:22:00 GMT" type="outline"/>

I'd love to see a conference run with decentralized decision-making. I'm just an attendee. I get to decide who speaks. Why? Because decision-making is decentralized. Of course a campaign needs centralized decision-making. No question. But an &lt;i&gt;election&lt;/i&gt; is a ouija board. The voters' decision is decentralized. Too many people believed the hype about Dean without thinking for themselves. Now you have to think. It wasn't a marvel of Internet technology, it was just an improvement, which ain't bad, but it's not a revolution. Here's the epitaph on Dean's of the Internet. It was 98 percent hype, two percent substance. The hype bought him an avalanche of free positive coverage in print, radio and television. The coverage, as usual, was bullshit. That was the juggernaut. Jim Moore, the insider, is the only analyst who has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/2004/01/28#a449&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; worth listening to.

Dean wasn't the savior, he was a candidate for president. But the people who stood up for Dean &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; revolutionaries. At best the Dean campaign was Netscape, inwardly focused, with a top-down map of the universe, with guess who at the top? This is the problem with looking to Presidential politics to be the venue for our salvation. Dean's choice was to start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/01/28#When:5:53:53AM&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; 25 percent party, or fire the Internet and try to stop Kerry.

If Dean is just like all the other candidates, there's nothing remarkable about his 25 percent of the NH vote. But, if instead of repping the entertainment industry as all Washington  Democrats have done so far, he actually considers Internet users to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/2003/11/17#a651&quot;&gt;contituency&lt;/a&gt;, and watches out for our interests, then 25 percent is &lt;i&gt;just awesome.&lt;/i&gt; It's on the map. If any minority got that kind of turnout all of a sudden you'd see a big shift in US politics. So let's watch Dean in the next few days. Now it's time to be creative with the much-mailigned Dean Corps. In the Iowa circus, that lasted months, okay people got tired of all the enthusiasm. But in a national campaign lasting a few weeks, use the advantage the Internet gives you. It's a word of mouth campaign." created="Wed, 28 Jan 2004 10:53:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

Yet it was just a little over a month ago that major press outlets were declaring the nomination process finished, with the poor voters playing no role at all. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-12-09-edit_x.htm&quot;&gt;USA Today said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Gore's early endorsement drowns out voters' voices.&quot; It's like saying a baseball game is over before the first pitch. It's wrong on its face. Some games aren't over with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Second, when estimating the sheer idiocy of the press, there is no bottom. You can &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; go lower. Just look in the archive to see what people believed at any point in time. It seems at this point that the Dean endorsement was the last hurrah for Mr Gore.

I saw the Great Dean Scream another dozen times. I heard the chief of the Democratic Party asked if he thought it was the end of the Dean campaign and he said the obvious -- it wasn't, and it should't be. Then they asked if Clark had screwed up by letting Michael Moore call the President a deserter. Later Russert repeatedly asked Clark to denounce Moore for saying that, but he wouldn't. The system is so perverse that Clark just danced instead of coming out and saying the obvious, yes, he's President, and yes, he got elected without his character getting the kind of examination the Democrats are getting. &quot;So Tim, let's turn it around,&quot; Clark might have said, &quot;Why didn't you grill Bush on that during the 2000 election? How did he become President without that getting vetted?&quot; I might go further and wonder how he got the &lt;i&gt;nomination&lt;/i&gt; without his military service being fully examined. And then to nail it, ask Tim to play the Dean Scream a few more times. (I'm starting to like it.) If the Republicans cry bloody murder, let's go back and figure out who painted Dean with &quot;angry&quot; label. Yeah, it was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/pow/article/0,8599,388523,00.html&quot;&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, in case you were wondering. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 25 Jan 2004 20:56:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="&quot;thinkusaalignright&quot;Another comment. The Democratic field this year is incredible. They're all good candidates. If you forget the labels the Republicans, the Clintons and the press have pinned on Dean, he'd be a good leader, a good commander in chief. We probably would get a good health care system, finally. His wife Judy would be a fantastic First Lady. I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the fact that she's more comfortable in sneakers and jeans than in fancy ball gowns. But Kerry is good, so is Edwards, and Clark, even Sharpton and Kucinich are interesting. Lieberman, well, he's more of a Republican, imho. Anyway, it seems a shame to waste a nomination on Dubya.

It's been interesting to watch posts from Joi Ito and Ethan Zuckerman and now Jay Rosen. I had a lot of the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/search/default?q=Davos&quot;&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The New Hampshire primary happened during Davos that year, and it was a shock (a good one) when John McCain won it. There were protests, the Internet bubble hadn't burst yet, the Alps are magic, and the sense of power amazing. Also amazing was the frankness with which world leaders spoke, such a difference from their television personnae. BTW, when I first met Zach Rosen at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deanforamerica.com&quot;&gt;DFA&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn't help exclaiming &quot;You look just like your uncle.&quot; I bet Zach is tired of hearing that, but he took it in stride.

They have the most interesting story in the world unveiling around them, and have almost nothing about it. Just the usual house organ stuff. They're frozen in the headlights. Now is the time, if not for Dean, for the Internet, to really use the weblog to tell the story of the voters of New Hampshire. Okay, the television networks won't carry your story, but word of mouth can. Do something hugely innovative, tell the truth. There were moments when the Dean campaign could do that, on the Internet.

					<outline text="This morning I watched the Diane Sawyer interview with Howard and Judy Dean, and was very touched. I told the Berkman Thursday group last night that I was pretty sure that Dean would turn the corner and emerge out of New Hampshire as a viable candidate, and after watching the interview and last night's debate, I'm even more sure. Last night I also told what I know about The Scream, and why it was so shocking and where it came from. After seeing the Sawyer interview I feel I must tell the story in public. First a disclaimer. No one in the Dean campaign asked me to tell it, nor does anyone in the Dean campaign know I'm going to. I don't work for them and I don't support any of the candidates for President at this time.

Several times during the meeting a loud crazy-sounding scream came from the room, everyone was doing it, and it was really frightening. The stuff of nightmares. This was before Howard Dean's rant. I asked Jim Moore what that was about, he said it's an Indian war yell or something like that, they used to do it in United Farm Workers rallies, and they adopted it at Dean For America.

					<outline text="They're probably not saying this publicly because it wouldn't seem contrite to do it, and they probably know they'd get roasted for saying the scream and ranting you heard was part of the motivational culture at DFA. Some have compared the Dean speech to a similar rant by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that made the rounds of the Net. So Dean gets a bit whacky, but after seeing it so many times, the shock value is fading. Taken at face value it wasn't anger, it was a steam-letting, and an attempt to rally the troops, and totally understandable. The press, as usual, is making a big deal of catching a candidate being a human being. But that's what he is. He's not an actor, he's not a commercial, he's not a deodorant, he's not a product, and I'm glad we have a chance to have this discussion. I'm not a Dean supporter (yet, but I'm getting there) and they didn't ask me to say this, but please, it's time for the press to let us have an election, or maybe it's time for us to have an election without them." created="Fri, 23 Jan 2004 12:23:40 GMT"/>

The Internet isn't just a way to raise money, we've already seen that it can put people where the voters are.

Getting Gore's support signalled that Dean would compromise any values he might have to win. Gore supported the CDA and his wife Tipper who appeared on behalf of Dean was on the wrong side of free speech in the music industry in the 80s. I used to think people don't remember, and maybe they don't, but their spotty history must be reflected in their body language.

His thread in the movie is about unlearning a lifetime of bitterness and of course the person who stole his wallet puts it back and he finds it, and Joan Crawford takes care of him, and life goes on.

The owner of Domino's gives to anti-abortion groups, not Domino's itself. This is an important distinction. Abortion is one of those moral conundrums where most of us think there's a clear answer, but we don't agree on what it is. That Tom Monaghan has a strong opinion and backs up his belief with contributions is not a problem for the pizza. The problem would be if, by buying a pizza from Domino's, I was making a contribution to a cause which I oppose. The power of the Internet. In the 70s all we had to go by was word of mouth, and if you tended to associate with people like yourself, you never heard a reasoned opposing viewpoint. It's fair to say that most people in Madison in the 70s, if not all, were in favor of abortion rights. Just asking a question about whether it was the company or the owner would likely get you yelled at. Really, I'm not kidding. " created="Sat, 17 Jan 2004 12:14:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

I am neutral on the Democratic presidential candidates. I may have opinions, but in my technical work, they're simply not relevant. I believe in politically agnostic tools. For example, the Pentagon was a big customer of my outliners. I grew to really like them as people. However as an anti-war person in the 60s and 70s, who'd-a-thought I'd be creating tools for them in the 80s. Another example. I used to love Domino's pizza (in Madison it was the best you can get). Then I found out that a percentage of their profits were going to fight against abortion rights. I stopped eating Domino's pizza immediately. Why should pizza take a political stand like that? So, if a campaign wants to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-pus1.htm&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; the envelope, I'm there. It doesn't mean I support the candidate, or that I will vote for the candidate, or that next week I won't show up at their competitor to help them deploy the latest technology. I'll be there if they'll let me try out new ideas, to raise the bar, to help more people be involved in the election." created="Sat, 17 Jan 2004 09:53:50 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Should you always give the user what he or she wants? No. It would be irresponsible to do so. For example, consider doctors and antibiotics. A doctor shouldn't give you an antibiotic unless it can really do you some good, and along with the prescription should come a stern lecture about taking the full course of the drug, not stopping when you start to feel better. As a user, you may just want to feel well, and that would be understandable. But the rest of us have an interest in you not being selfish. If you stop taking the drug before all the nasty germs are killed, you're going to help create a strain of the germ that's immune to the drug. Eventually there won't be an antibiotic that works, and future generations will die from diseases that are totally curable today. So while the user may want to stop taking the drug, the doctor would be irresponsible in prescribing it if he or she felt it was likely that you wouldn't finish taking it. The same idea applies to reading bad XML files. If my code reads them, then yours has to too. Eventually the XML stops working.

				<outline text="One of the reasons the Share Your OPML project has been so much fun is that it has been so easy to give users the features they ask for. Even so, I realized early-on that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the demand for new features. The solution is to provide access to the data behind the website so other people can build on it. For example, very few people know that the popular Technorati service is built on the backend of weblogs.com, called changes.xml. Another example was the open service list for UserLand's first aggregator in 1999 and 2000, which enabled a community of developers to form around RSS. We're going to do it again. I've spent the last few days coding a new flow of static OPML files. At the same time I worked it out with Hal Roberts lead developer at the Berkman &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/geekroom/&quot;&gt;geek room&lt;/a&gt;, to statically serve the data from a harvard.edu server. Hal has done some really excellent work. People have been asking for a service that can serve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/projects/apache/gzip/&quot;&gt;compressed&lt;/a&gt; content, so Hal programmed our server to do that. I'm working with a small group of developers now on testing the new capability. We're still finding problems. When it's released we'll have sample code for Python, Tcl and UserTalk and perhaps a few other languages. It's all XML so it's easy to work with. And then, when you have an idea for an app that builds on the Share Your OPML flow, you can ask &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; developer with a scripting language to develop it for you, not just me. This is good, users and developers, working together, having fun. &lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;" created="Wed, 14 Jan 2004 11:37:07 GMT" type="outline"/>

A few weeks ago I was eating at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charleshotel.com/hotel/102000033.asp&quot;&gt;fine restaurant&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge and saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chefrick.com/html/cpotpie.html&quot;&gt;Chicken Pot Pie&lt;/a&gt; on the menu. It had been years since I had one, so I ordered it. It was delicious. Every bit as good as I remembered. So when it got really cold last week I went to the supermarket and bought some, figuring that I'd have to bake them in the oven, which was okay because it was so cold and I was pretty lazy and didn't mind waiting for up to an hour to eat my delicious pot pie. Well, surprise surprise, they make them now so they can cook in ten minutes &lt;i&gt;in a microwave.&lt;/i&gt; And they have an ingenious packaging thing so that the crust browns, almost as if it had been baked. The pies come out great. They cost about $3 and are really filling. Add a Diet Coke and you got a meal. Nothing earth shaking, but if even one person gets to eat some really good comfort food on a cold night, it was worth it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 14 Jan 2004 00:34:42 GMT" name="imgSrchttpwwwscriptingcomimagesarchivescriptingcom20040113piejpgWidth55Height34Border0AlignrightHspace15Vspace5AltaPictureNamedPiejpgsometimesITryToShakeYourWorldOtherTimesLikeNowIJustGoForAMinorUpgradeAFewWeeksAgoIWasEatingAtAAHrefhttpwwwcharleshotelcomhotel102000033aspfineRestaurantaInCambridgeAndSawAHrefhttpwwwchefrickcomhtmlcpotpiehtmlchickenPotPieaOnTheMenuItHadBeenYearsSinceIHadOneSoIOrderedItItWasDeliciousEveryBitAsGoodAsIRememberedSoWhenItGotReallyColdLastWeekIWentToTheSupermarketAndBoughtSomeFiguringThatIdHaveToBakeThemInTheOvenWhichWasOkayBecauseItWasSoColdAndIWasPrettyLazyAndDidntMindWaitingForUpToAnHourToEatMyDeliciousPotPieWellSurpriseSurpriseTheyMakeThemNowSoTheyCanCookInTenMinutesIinAMicrowaveiAndTheyHaveAnIngeniousPackagingThingSoThatTheCrustBrownsAlmostAsIfItHadBeenBakedThePiesComeOutGreatTheyCostAbout3AndAreReallyFillingAddADietCokeAndYouGotAMealNothingEarthShakingButIfEvenOnePersonGetsToEatSomeReallyGoodComfortFoodOnAColdNightItWasWorthIt" type="outline"/>

An expert in a given area puts together a set of feeds that you would subscribe to if you want a balanced flow of information on his or her topic of expertise. You let the expert subscribe to feeds on your behalf. I've gotten the first taste of what this is like by reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.scripting.com/rssAggregator&quot;&gt;aggregator page&lt;/a&gt; on the Share Your OPML site. As new sites come on the Top-100, as the aggregated interests of the community shift, I automatically start reading sites I wasn't reading before. I don't have to do anything. I like this. So at last Thursday's Berkman meeting I asked two of our regulars, Rick Heller and Jay McCarthy, to start doing these reading lists, and Rick is ready with what he calls a list of &quot;political blogs that provide a balanced diet of liberal and conservative views.&quot; Now I have more work to do, to create a user interface that lets Rick edit &lt;a href=&quot;http://monster2.scripting.com/blogs/gems/feeds/mySubscriptions.xml&quot;&gt;his list&lt;/a&gt; at will, and presents an easy way for you to subscribe to his list so he can automatically subscribe you to new feeds (and unsubscribe you from others). The technology is not that hard, but it's essential, imho. Two comments. 1. I'm talking with other developers about building around this idea, so there will be another round of open formats and protocols building on RSS, OPML and XML-RPC; and 2.

This may make his competitors look like idealistic dreamers for thinking it would serve users' interests if they spend more time designing and coding new features and less time working around bugs in content. With all due respect, I think Greg is wrong about users. They &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; care about quality. We're finally emerging from the period where users of RSS were uninformed, confused and dumb. This happens every time around the loop. At first the users don't understand how it works, then they figure it out, and they leave behind vendors who depend on them being confused. BTW, there's nothing that says that the aggregator vendors can't get their act together on &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; XML formats, not just new ones.

I wonder why? I assume it's because people don't know that the feeds are there?" created="Sun, 11 Jan 2004 21:51:49 GMT" type="outline"/>

Boston is the big New England TV market and New Hampshire is in New England, so we see the ads, and boy are they interesting. I've never seen this kind of political advertising before. Suggestion to the campaigns, post your latest ads on the the Web and send me pointers, please. It's a cheap way of getting your message out and generating buzz. A curious thing about all the ads, at the end of each, the candidate says &quot;My name is John Kerry, and I approved this message.&quot; They all say exactly the same thing (except Kucinich who says &quot;Did I approve this message? You bet I did.&quot; Weird.) Anyway, why? This is new. This must have something to do with campaign finance reform.

One of the things people want is the ability to subscribe to OPML files. This a very powerful idea, and I want to go all the way with it. It's the next level after RSS. Not only do I subscribe to your feed, but I want to subscribe to a set of feeds that you choose for me. Imagine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/&quot;&gt;Jenny the Librarian&lt;/a&gt; managing a set of librarian feeds for programmers. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://politicalwire.com/&quot;&gt;Taegan Goddard&lt;/a&gt; keeping a set of political feeds for people who want to watch all the campaigns. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2002/08/14#When:1:03:47PM&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/archiveScriptingCom/2004/01/08/joan.jpg&quot; width=&quot;45&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;Maybe she's slumming?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This goes somewhere. And it's curious timing because this evening I turned on the code that teaches feeds.scripting.com to subscribe to OPML files. If, instead of uploading, you &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.scripting.com/enterUrl&quot;&gt;enter&lt;/a&gt; the URL of an OPML file, we'll check it &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.scripting.com/eventLog&quot;&gt;periodically&lt;/a&gt; to see if it changed, and if it did, we'll re-load it, and use it recalc the Top 100, and to refresh your &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.scripting.com/viewSharedFeeds?source=3d551b4a3d20bf17996e6eb98cd47269&amp;op=View&quot;&gt;Other People's Feeds page&lt;/a&gt;.

He imagined -- what if, at random, Lotus version 5.0 magically appeared on his computer one day. It's just a pattern of bits, it's improbable, for sure, but it &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; happen. Think of all the millions of dollars that he would have made, and all the millions that Lotus would have lost. So fast-forward to 2004, Yahoo has a bug that somehow makes it &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.scripting.com/discuss/msgReader$168?mode=day&quot;&gt;appear&lt;/a&gt; as if they have a built-in RSS aggregator.

Anyway, Clay Shirky isn't a blogger, he's more of an &lt;i&gt;anti-&lt;/i&gt;blogger. Does Guterman read the people he writes about? That's the cool thing about weblogs, you don't have to guess what people think. Anyway, I've gotten used to getting pushed aside. It's happened over and over. That's life. I'm not doing this because I want to be popular, I'm doing it because I believe we need more people telling us what they see. Do I think it will revolutionize journalism? I think it is already doing that. Will it tear down the media monoliths? They're doing a pretty good job of that on their own. Would I like to see them torn down? Yes if they get in the way. Are they now in the way? No. Had Guterman called I could have explained this. Instead he wrote a stupid mindless piece, all stereotype and caricature and zero insight. Too bad because he's a smart guy. He wrote a great series about content management in The Industry Standard in the 90s. Back then I wrote him to explain how Vignette and Interwoven et al were doing it wrong, and how weblogs were the way of the future. I wonder if we could get an acknowledgement of that Jimmy?

Programmers have to have health insurance, send their kids to good schools, make mortgage payments, and retire someday. And these days they have to hire lawyers to defend themselves against the lawyers of the big companies. It's romantic to think of programmers working just for the approval of their peers.

In 2004, it's hard to say which dominance has more potential to do damage to competition. Or apply The New York Times test. If the Times were promoting a service, or appearing to promote a service, that it owned, but it wasn't clear from its name that it was owned by the Times, would they include a note saying they owned it?
