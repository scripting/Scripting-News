					<outline text="At last night's dinner I sat across from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pentdego.com/&quot;&gt;entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; who runs a company that makes content for cell phones. He told the story of WAP and WML and how they had splintered and reformed so many times, that now there are thousands of variations, and it's basically impossible to make applications that work over enough of the market to be economically viable. " created="Tue, 27 Apr 2004 06:32:15 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Yesterday Adam Curry, a friend of mine (a word I don't use lightly), said when he sees me write about RSS, he quickly skips to the next item, thinking &quot;I'm glad Dave is taking care of that.&quot; Don't be so sure, I said to Adam. The people who want to splinter the formats just make my personality the issue, something they couldn't do if you joined me in fighting the splintering. If two people say no, it can't be about personalities, because we'd have to share the personality flaws. When you make me the only voice, that's what happens.

I said you now own Joi Ito. Help him learn how he could help. He invests in lots of companies that benefit from RSS. It's time for him to do something good for RSS to balance the books. He's used it too well, his companies, particularly SixApart, have repeatedly undermined a coalescing of the format. Someone needs to talk wtih Joi about this. I've tried, and failed. Maybe Adam and Joi can figure out what Joi needs to get him on board. Then, after that works, we'll find someone else for you to work with, and then someone for Joi to work with.

They said sometimes you have to pull the battery on your laptop to get it work because the laptop-plus-battery consumes too much juice, but the laptop-itself is okay. When I plugged the laptop into the converter, the light on the power-brick would pulse and the machine would start up and then hibernate, over and over. I tried to charge my iPod and it wouldn't charge. So I tried pulling the battery on the laptop and voila, it runs. So I am able to get online (for 17.5 euro a day, what a ripoff) but my battery isn't charging, which is a problem I have to solve.

					<outline text="I didn't like Google's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evhead.com/archives/2004_04_01_archive.asp#108266094752373041&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; yesterday which came through Evan Williams. It was about as snotty as it could be, and started a whole bunch of people characterizing the issue as a conspiracy theory. How Nixonesqe. This is par for the course, Google's PR with the blogging community is usually like this these days, but it wasn't always so. There was a time when they dealt with us with respect, understanding that we are part of the Web that they cover with their search engine. As they've grown they seem to have forgotten that. "/>
					<outline text="But in fact, Google &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; do things to force Atom support, so the conjecture is reasonable, and &lt;b&gt;Evan didn't deny they were doing it. &lt;/b&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Exactly this sort of thing happened with the Google Toolbar and its support for Blogger, just weeks after they said they wouldn't do anything to favor it over other weblog tools. They said it was just a beta, but the beta became a shipping product and they never explained why they weren't breaking the promise. In fact they were. There were APIs they could have used which would have made their toolbar work with any blogging tool. This would have clearly been the appropriate technical, not-evil, approach."/>
					<outline text="Google is a very powerful company that plays very fast with developers and content providers. Up till now none of the issues have involved the crawler or the search engine. Now they've crossed into that territory. We deserve a better answer than the one Evan gave us, certainly a more respectfully stated one."/>

				<outline text="About Zawodny's invitation to flame" created="Fri, 23 Apr 2004 23:14:45 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Yesterday I pointed to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001902.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy Zawodny that appeared to be calling for a flame fest with me as the guest of honor. I pointed to it after the first few comments made it clear that it wasn't going to be a flame fest. In fact, it was the most rational discussion of conflict disclosure I've seen to date in the weblog world. It left me bursting with pride to be part of this community." created="Fri, 23 Apr 2004 23:14:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's nothing wrong when someone writes an essay advocating something that they have a financial interest in, as long as the interest is disclosed. For example, if you're going to buy a house, it's good to know you're reading something written by someone who will profit if you buy the house. That's why you get an inspector to look over the house after you decide to make an offer. And why you'd feel betrayed if it turned out the inspector was getting a percentage of the sale. (In fact the inspector would go to jail for doing that.)" created="Fri, 23 Apr 2004 23:16:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So when a Google shareholder write's an empassioned defense of Google, it was correct for Zawodny to ask if he was a shareholder. He did ask, and got an answer, and as far as I was concerned, that was news, so I pointed to it. All of this is good, it's the system working as it should. " created="Fri, 23 Apr 2004 23:17:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="As I read John Battelle's &lt;a href=&quot;http://battellemedia.com/&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of search engines, I wonder if he is consulting for the companies he's writing about. John has a long career as a journalist and now as a professor, both professions &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; disclosures of conflicts of interest, so I assume he has no such conflict, because I haven't seen a disclaimer from him." created="Fri, 23 Apr 2004 23:18:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On the other hand, I often see people who I know have conflicts writing in their area of conflict without disclosure. In a world where everyone's playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=footsie&quot;&gt;footsie&lt;/a&gt;, if you tend to out people, you quickly get a rep for being difficult, or having personality problems. Does this sound familiar? Heh. " created="Fri, 23 Apr 2004 23:19:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In any case, the thread on Zawodny's was a milestone.

Same idea. More and more, the media is owned by big faceless companies who can be manipulated by the government. Blogs are great, they're like personal magazines. This is no longer a vision, it's reality. So if you want to publish an idea, go ahead. You don't need to sell it to a publisher. The next step, which we're on the cusp of, is video production and distribution using RSS and BitTorrent, and perhaps other P2P methods. Adam Curry, who began his television career working for one of the behemoths, has become the visionary for the personal television network of the future.

Why doesn't Google trust &lt;i&gt;us?&lt;/i&gt; When I try to engage them in conversation, about important stuff, they offer all kinds of defenses, ranging from accusing me of playing the age card (Michael Gartenberg witnessed this), to saying &quot;it's an engineering issue&quot; (an insult, it's not) and in one case, just walking away mid-sentence. This company has a problem. The debacle over the privacy of Gmail, which isn't much of a technical issue (the other guys, even bigger companies, already do what Google is talking about), is self-inflicted. This is a company that used to know how to talk with people like myself. Now they have every defense up, and the insiders don't want to let them off the hook until they show an interest in communicating. I'm with them on that. It's not personal as my fellow fellow &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/andrew/&quot;&gt;Andrew McLoughlin&lt;/a&gt; claimed it was (he's now an exec at Google). It a conversation.

Tonight's press conference was pretty bad. At one point I thought maybe Bush should just resign and go be President of Iraq. He seems to have lost track of his job, which is President of the country I live in, the country I just paid taxes to, the country whose young people are dying to save a country that &lt;i&gt;did not&lt;/i&gt; attack us on Sept 11 and one that clearly does not want our help. Watching him fumble tonight, I realized this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/search/default?q=bumbles+along+twisting&quot;&gt;Mr Joe Average&lt;/a&gt; thrust into a situation way over his head, as if that wasn't bad enough, he started a war that has no end. Shame on the Republicans for nominating this guy in 2000. He can't complete a sentence. He talked about a chicken farm in Libya (twice!). The Republicans still have the power to fix it, get a new candidate for the November election, and start the withdrawal from Iraq now. It's a disaster.

Brought three DVDs with me, watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/&quot;&gt;Good Will Hunting&lt;/a&gt; yesterday on the plane, watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105323/&quot;&gt;Scent of a Woman&lt;/a&gt; now.

				<outline text="A thought I'll expand on later. The only economic factor you ever hear about are taxes. But the debt and the deficit matter too, maybe much more. The hype is that we should be ashamed of ourselves for passing on the problem to later generations, but that understates the problem. Our creditors could say, at any time, no more credit. Then, at current rates, we're going to be short $1 trillion per year. That's more than $3000 for every American, and that's just the shortfall. You'll still have to pay taxes.

					<outline text="I need to make a couple of disclosures, but I want to be as sensitive as I can. I don't want to be part of supposedly open processes that only include a small number of people. They aren't open, you could say say they're &quot;as open as possible,&quot; to be generous; or &quot;exclusive,&quot; to be really accurate. " created="Fri, 09 Apr 2004 11:47:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I've had several email exchanges and one conference call about formalizing the specification for &quot;RSS&quot; with a standards organization. My position in these private communications is exactly stated in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#roadmap&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; section of the RSS 2.0 spec. I'm basically explaining how it would apply to a formalization process, which I would support. I would not agree to be the chair of a working group, probably even wouldn't make sense for me to be a member of the group. That's all that's happened so far.

					<outline text="Second, I've been helping the evangelists at Microsoft, Lenn Pryor, Jeff Sandquist, Robert Scoble, in formulating a new approach to working with developers. I plan to be open about this too, because my goal here is to help bootstrap a two-party system, and when that's working, a three-party system, and so on. I think Microsoft can exist very well in that kind of environment, but it's going to be a tough thing to pull off, because they're so large, and they're basically a gravity well, largely influenced by their own internal conversation, that it's hard for an average MS person to understand why people outside MS even bother to exist.

					<outline text="And now with so many of them having weblogs, it's going to be hard to keep MS people frrom interfering. But that was the problem with Apple, and Netscape and now Google; and it will be a problem in the tech industry until it's solved. How can an organization be clued in, and still work with outsiders.

He was the Wild West's equivalent of an A-List blogger. How demoralizing it must be for WBH to achieve so much fame, only to have people hate him for it. Then I felt for the central character, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/cast/character/alswearengen.shtml&quot;&gt;Swearengen&lt;/a&gt;, the murderous saloon man who is betrayed, and now has to deal with competition.

Most Americans probably believe that Iraq was responsible for 9-11. If they found out the truth, they might wonder, as Clarke does, why we're fighting a war there. According to Clarke it's a very bad move. It weakens western-friendly countries in the region. Iraq was a poor choice for combatting terror, Iran, Syria and Saudia Arabia are much more involved. We only have token forces in Afghanistan and haven't wiped out the leadership of the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Never mind that Iraq is a morass. The focus of the press and the Bush spinners has been on placing blame for 9-11 on Bush. The book isn't really about that, it's about the direction we're going &lt;i&gt;now. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Mon, 05 Apr 2004 22:16:18 GMT" type="outline"/>

What if someone else had been President on 9-11, and decided to use the new support for the US in a positive way, not just to wipe out Al Qaeda which he surely had global support for, but also to do something to improve something about the world. He doesn't answer the question, but it's still an interesting one. What if Truman had been President? Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton. It's hard to imagine any of them rushing to war with a random opponent, without international support, without a defined goal, assuming quick victory.

It only matters if you are the best, but it wasn't always that way. Before movies, records, radio and television, every town had a best singer, live performances were how people got music, so creativity was much more decentralized, there was more of it. I told a story of a conference I was at last year, and at my lunch table was a young man who said he is Jack Benny's grandson. He said he had no talent. How could Jack Benny's grandson possibly have no talent! Then I looked at the faces of the students in the Harvard classroom.

				<outline text="My vacation is over. From now until the 18th I'm mainly focused on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;. Tomorrow and Tuesday I'll be in NY meeting with three of the discussion leaders (also going on a job interview, how about that). We're going to have a dutch treat dinner on Friday night at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.durgin-park.com/&quot;&gt;Durgin Park&lt;/a&gt;. There should be a way to sign up for that later today or tomorrow morning. Lunch on Saturday is extended to 1.5 hours so people have time to wash their hands and do a little schmoozing. Last year the one hour lunch break proved too short by about 15 minutes. There will be a party on Saturday night, Adam and I are splitting the expense. Which brings me to the subject of money. We've priced the conference very reasonably (it's free) but we do need some more money, not much, to buy food for the party and to fly in some people who have important contributions to make, but don't have the money to travel. If you can afford to kick in $50 or even $500 that would be great. Let me know, and if there are enough people who want to participate we'll come up with an easy way to do it. However, I need to be very clear that this is not in any way a money-making enterprise for me, Berkman Center, or Harvard Law School, or anyone else. We'll spend all the money we get on the conference itself, and if there's any left over, we'll give it back with thanks to the people who contribute. We're also looking for volunteers to help welcome people, and monitor sessions and webcasts. Jay McCarthy will post something about that shortly. Many thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skybuilders.com/users/bob/bios/biopics.html&quot;&gt;Bob Doyle&lt;/a&gt;, for his help with the video webcast and for providing the projectors for each of the rooms.

A year ago people wouldn't have been so outspoken with their concerns about Google (many had them, but only expressed them privately). The honeymoon for Google is ending. A reporter told me about their top PR person a few days ago, saying he's the smartest one in the business. I had never heard of him. Before he came on, I had a very good working relationship with Cindy McCaffery, who was the top PR person before him. Now I don't even rate a &lt;i&gt;notice&lt;/i&gt; that there's a new person. PR is about relationships, that's Marketing 101. Clearly Google doesn't handle criticism well, and they're about to enter the big leagues, in competition with huge companies with seasoned management, that know (more or less) that whether or not someone has gone negative on you is irrelevant, you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barrymoltz.com/articles/published/pub_enemiescloser.html&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; have to work with them. And the other guys know how to sling the mud, and it's going to stick on old Google if they don't do something, quickly, to rebuild relationships that used to work. If anyone has a positive relationship with them on a PR level, I assume it's because they've never written anything remotely negative. " created="Sun, 04 Apr 2004 00:25:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I see a flurry of activity in the Are Bloggers Journalists? permathread. I love the arguments people make about how thorough and skilled most professionals are, and how most bloggers just shoot from the hip. I think these people need to look closer. Journalists do all that they think bloggers do, with an extra added bonus of arrogance. There's no accountability. No equivalent of the ABA or AMA. No malpractice suits to worry about. I love to draw analogies. Try this one out. I'm sure travel agents said something like what people say about journalists. In the last month I've booked four trips, and I'm about to book a fifth. One through Travelocity (who still hasn't given back the money they stole from me, another issue for another day) and three through Expedia (which isn't without its glitches, in Gainesville they reserved a handicapped room for me, and I had to wait an hour before I could check in, and the room had an absolutely bizarre bathroom). Anyway, are there still travel agents? Has their industry shrunk or grown? You may be surprised at my answer. Yes there are still travel agents, and the industry has grown enormously. But I do it myself, and I do a better job. I am willing to rebook a trip if it turns out one flight has more open seats than the one I'm booked on. I shop for bargains. I read the descriptions of all the hotels, and I search for reviews. I don't mind putting in a lot of extra effort for the customer, who is someone I really care about a lot -- me. I used to use professional travel agents, and I'd end up staying at golf resorts (I don't like golf, or golfers) or far from the places I wanted to visit, or pay way too much, or get a seat I didn't like. For BloggerCon, I'm going to write a review of all the professions that have been transformed this way. Journalism &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one of them.

But of course if I tried to sell them on a news report written by me on this subject, I'd have to disclose all that I've done in this area, which (as with Hammersley) would immediately disqualify me. Instead of complaining about us, the Guardian should dig in right now, no excuses, and ask Hammersley about all the points Cadenhead raises, and if he can't answer them, immediately issue a mea culpa, and be a lot more careful in the future about having partisans writing news reports.

Why does the Guardian (or any other paper for that matter) employ an arbiter and then not respond when an ethical issue is raised? I've sent emails and talked on the phone with various people about this. They can't seem to hear that the issue isn't that I got some bad press, that happens all the time. What matters is that a major newspaper, whose integrity appears to matter to them, has let one side in a dispute report the news, without labeling it as opinion. Secondary, there are major factual errors in the piece all of which favor Hammerley's position. And third, yes it does make me angry that they make me look like someone that I'm not. But don't miss the first and second issues. You may know that it was an opinion piece, but readers of the Guardian were not told. Now the core question -- does this happen regularly at the Guardian? Seems to me they'd want to protect their reputation by troubling themselves to answer the questions."/>

North Florida has the best beaches anywhere. Lots of room, great swimming, Listening to Richard Clarke's book. Audio books are perfect for the beach. No fussing with pages, or getting tanning oil all over the place. You can close your eyes and soak it up.

Yeah, the right-wingers are missing the point. Sure I think Clarke is a sanctimonious self-important Republican.  But what he says is worth listening to, considering, and doing something about.
