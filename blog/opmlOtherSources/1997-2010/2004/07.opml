Reporters could have avoided this misinterpretation had they spent less time following Bush around the country and more time sitting at their desks doing Nexis searches, where they could have unearthed old Bush quotes like this one from 1996: 'The Republican Party must put a compassionate face on a conservative philosophy.'

				<outline text="I'm at Boston's Logan Airport, using their WiFi. It's $6.95 for 24 hours of access. Two major irritations at modern airports I always forget to mention (because I rarely blog in airports I guess). First, people sitting behind you in the waiting area talking on their cell phones, saying very mundane personal things that I really didn't want to know, at full volume. I guess the conversations are especially irritating because you can only hear one side. You wonder if the person at the other end is really interested, or is as irritated as you are. The second thing that bothers me is how you get separated from your wallet as you go through the screening. There it is, sitting out in the open, waiting for anyone to pick it up. The guy in front of me complained about his $6000 Rolex watch being so vulnerable, so they went and got it for him. I mumbled my wallet is worth more than $6000 to an identity thief. Did they get it? Nahhh. This goes along somewhat with the lax security at Fleet, where people got in without any kind of matchup between their ticket and their ID. I'm not any kind of security expert, but I think we got off easy this week. " created="Fri, 30 Jul 2004 13:41:36 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Something I noticed too. There's a lack of discipline among the pros which has deformed discourse in all areas including science, technology, economics, medicine (areas where accuracy really counts). The practice of quoting out of context, if you don't want to be made to look like a fool, turns opinions into mush. I got quoted out of context quite a few times this week, I knew it would happen when I posted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/07/26#When:5:01:42PM&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; about how boring the convention was on Monday. I published the bit anyway, because communicating with my readers is more important to me than potentially being made to look like an idiot by professional reporters. This is something I'd like them to look at. If you're really an idealist (and many pros are) you have no choice but to &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; to convey the meaning of the people you quote.

I've seen all kinds of variants in the last few days, some of which are real pages on one of my sites, but are not my weblog. In the write-up on the WHYY interview above they break new ground and list an &lt;a href=&quot;http://Scripting-News.com/&quot;&gt;address&lt;/a&gt; that's 404. Reminds me of the old days when we would typeset manuals, and the print designers would insist on typesetting the screen shots. Of course they'd introduce errors, and the users, who didn't use typeset computer screens, must have felt a disconnect. Eventually, I fired the typesetters and we ran actual screen shots. Advice to our brothers and sisters in print, radio and TV, you gotta test the URLs, and it helps to have a mailto icon that goes directly to someone respoinsible for the content so errors can quickly be corrected.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/007953&quot;&gt;Matt Haughey notes&lt;/a&gt; that Fox only shows small parts of convention speeches, without context. They are able to do this because like all press at the show, they get advance copies of the speeches. Maybe this is why the Dems shouldn't distribute advance copies. All reporters have laptops. The whole thing could be webbed and distribution would be instantaneous. It would also defeat the Dewey Beats Truman &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/07/28#When:9:49:17PM&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; we saw yesterday. The Dems should go to a Steve Jobs event and see how they do it at Apple. There's an art to making dull announcements seem exciting. I bet Steve could have rolled out the program Edwards launched yesterday with a lot more sitting on the edge of the seats than we saw. (But Steve could probably learn a few tricks from the Dems.

				<outline text="Want another dirty little secret? Of course you do. &quot;;-&gt;&quot; &lt;i&gt;You can't hear what the speakers are saying from up in the blogger cocktail lounge on the seventh floor.&lt;/i&gt; It's all mumbled and fuzzy. Rebecca, Jesse and I read the transcript of the Edwards speech while he was giving it, he didn't deviate much, but he didn't read the exact speech either. All the other speakers were totally jumbled. To hear what they actually say I have to try to catch it on C-SPAN after the show back in the hotel room. This leads to my second feature request. How about a live audio webcast, on the LAN in the convention, so we can put on headphones and hear the speakers' actual words in real-time. We've tried using the C-SPAN webcast, and it works (though not well on the flaky WiFi setup) -- but here's the problem -- there's a five-ten second delay. So the crowd is erupting while we're hearing the buildup. Not very good. Eventually I gave up on that approach, and just tried to figure out the mood by watching and listening as best I could without technical assistance.

Last night I cut out early to have dinner with a friend who is not part of the convention. Took a cab down Commonwealth Ave. Downtown Boston is a military encampment. The uniforms were very strange, lots of weird colors, helmets, bullet-proof vests, handcuffs. A motorcade held up traffic, but I couldn't figure out who would be in such a large motorcade, and the special security was unbelievable. Heavy armored vehicles. Snipers on the roofs, armed guards at every public building, and this was several blocks from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fleetcenter.com/&quot;&gt;Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. As I left the convention area I felt a real sense of relief. If there's going to be an attack tonight I'm going to watch it on TV, I thought.

First, it got more interesting, and second, while it was really boring at 5PM, no regrets. I recalled watching conventions as a youth, probably the Ford-Carter conventions in 1976, and the ones that nominated Mondale and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0126310/radioStationPictures/images/2004/02/09/dukakis_tank%5B1%5D.jpg&quot;&gt;Dukakis&lt;/a&gt;. I go back as far as Nixon-McGovern in 1972. In all cases, you could tell, watching it on TV, that the people at the convention totally weren't paying attention to the speeches, even though the cameras were focused on them. I remember feeling, at the time, what a waste. Now the networks have figured that out and aren't bothering to cover the speeches that are so dull even the delegates don't bother. On the other hand it was a good move for bloggers to be included, and a good move for us to come. The convention proceeds at a pace that's more amenable to our style of reporting. We're getting the hang of it. I expect to be writing about this convention for weeks, months and years to follow, Murphy-willing, of course. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Tue, 27 Jul 2004 11:43:54 GMT" type="outline"/>

Answer, for the most, they're using their normal laptops. I'm using my ThinkPad. Other stuff: The new Nikon Coolpix, USB cable for the camera, two mikes, two headphones, a Radio Shack line splitter (so I can plug in two mikes at once, but it doesn't work), a power strip, USB mouse, cell phone, business cards, and that's about it. I deliberately emptied my backback this morning, a dry-run yesterday proved I was carrying too much weight, no need to bring the iPod (my laptop has iTunes and all the music on the iPod). Don't need my crossword book, or my passport or checkbook and all the other miscellaneous michegas that's accumulated in my knapsack. Amazing how much weight all that adds up to.

I thought about it, then realized you could say the same thing about a lot of other things that command public attention. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html&quot;&gt;Super&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.janetsnipplering.biz/&quot;&gt;Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2003/12/31/playBall.jpg&quot;&gt;World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/03/03/subway.jpg&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/a&gt;. Or the inauguration, or even perhaps Election Day. Because people say it, does it mean it's true? Well, in some sense, &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; ever happens. Just ask a Buddhist. I mean really. We live, we die, we assume it makes a difference, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/05/12/DoGalaxiesDream&quot;&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; do we know? So the conventional wisdomers are asking a very deep question. While they're examining this, I'm going to go to Boston with my digital camera, microphone, outliner and content management system, take some pictures, and share them. The idea will be to show the grainy images, the small picture, not the big one. What does this look like in person-size chunks? What would it be like to be here? Nothing more than that. I did the same thing at Davos in 2000, by the way, and still like to review the stories and pictures from time to time. Same with 24 Hours of Democracy.

Three weeks into it, the psychological addiction is so incredibly powerful. I felt like I was dancing with a seven-foot cigarette, saying Just Smoke Me, every waking moment, and sometimes in my dreams. Every time I wanted to solve a problem or think, I'd reach for the cigarette that wasn't there. There's no silver bullet, I've found. Over two years later, there are still moments of craving, sometimes insane, almost psychotic, craving. Instead of punching my hand through a wall (which hurts), I take five deep breaths, and say &quot;I love you&quot; to myself. It works. The craving passes, and often, but not always, is replaced with a sense of well-being. Also, no matter how much I crave, there's no chance I'll smoke, I cough almost uncontrollably sometimes just &lt;i&gt;being around&lt;/i&gt; smoking. I think my body would totally reject the smoke. Anyway, best of luck, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do it, and it's totally worth doing." created="Wed, 21 Jul 2004 09:25:11 GMT" type="outline"/>

He used the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution as his cover. We won World War II, which was a much bigger war, covering much more territory, with a much better equipped enemy; Vietnam was a disaster.

Now that is really weird. What city should I choose to fly from? It'll be easy for me to get in and out of NY no matter where I am the week after next. I still may go to California for the blogging conference, but I'm leaning towards driving south to Florida and back in time for the convention. I'm going to look at locating in three places for the next year: Florida, New Mexico, and California. The first two are the two battleground states that I think I'd like to spend a year in. I've already spent a lot of time in northeast Florida, and I know I'd like it, it's where my uncle lived for 25 years. I've &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; spent a lot of time in New Mexico, but it sure looks lovely, and it's got good skiing (in Taos and in nearby Colorado), and it's inexpensive, and it's got massage schools, which I'm leaning towards, because I want to get into shape in the next year. I also need a good place for programming. If I land in California, it'll probably either be in Berkeley or Santa Cruz, for the same reasons I like New Mexico. It's more expensive, but I know a lot more people in Calif. On the other hand, I can't say I like the software atmosphere in Calif. Still not a lot of emphasis on technology, mostly on get-rich-quick corner-cuts, which is fine, but it's not what I like to do, or be around. Still dreaming of Europe in the back of my mind.

First, Tim, in the last paragraph, you mean \&quot;apple\&quot; not &quot;atom.&quot; But that's the trivial mistake, the really big one is the idea that any substantial portion of the content of the Web is going to convert to XML. One has to assume that if it hasn't happened after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm&quot;&gt;six years&lt;/a&gt;, there must be a good reason it hasn't (yes there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; reasons to do it, but not reasons that make sense to most of the millions of people who have learned HTML). HTML has frozen in its 1996 form, right around the time the standards &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/08#standardsNazis&quot;&gt;gurus&lt;/a&gt; took over.

He illustrates how a user-oriented developer looks at the Web. I agree with everything Brendan says up to the point where he says RSS and HTML are orthogonal. Take another look, RSS wraps chunks of HTML with useful metadata. Anyway, I think what they're doing is good, and if they stick with it, Microsoft may pay attention at some point. With the Kooky Buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/07/08#When:7:35:17PM&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt;, it appears maybe they've loosened up.

				<outline text="&quot;thinkusaalignright&quot;Okay, the report from the Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday told us something that everyone with basic common sense already knew. 1. There were no WMDs in Iraq. 2. The President knew that. 3. So did all the other members of the administration: Cheney, Powell, Rice, Rumsfeld, etc. 4. They all lied, many of them still are lying. 5. Bush gave a speech yesterday about how Kerry flip-flops, what a lot of nerve he has, on the same day a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/07/10#whosOnTheSenateIntelligenceCommittee&quot;&gt;committee&lt;/a&gt; chaired by a Republican, with a Republican majority, confirmed that his pretense for war was a lie. A war in which hundreds of Americans have died. Now, at the same time, we're asked to believe that the announcement of a  terrorist threat by this administration during the rollout of the Democratic ticket is just the normal course of business. Now, really, what's the probability that's true? 1 percent? 5 percent maybe? If you're a Republican, now that you know what you know about how the war started, do you believe in their integrity when it comes to terrorist threats? I think it's high time for the Republicans to clean this mess up. We're a deep troubled situation, and we need a regime with &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; integrity running the country. Even the staunchest Republican must see that by now? I don't get it. &lt;i&gt;It's not too late for the Republicans to run someone else. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Sat, 10 Jul 2004 15:56:32 GMT" type="outline"/>

Since then, they have labored in relative obscurity, growing a customer base, raising VC money, adding people, and staying out of the way. Then Google launches Gmail, with a very Oddpostish interface, and someone at Yahoo says &quot;Hmmm, I've seen that somewhere,&quot; calls up Ethan and Iain and their new VCs and asks &quot;Are you for sale?&quot; and the rest is history. Now Google has competition on elegance of user interface. Sorry the announcement comes at such an awkard time, everyone in the tech press must be getting in their cars and driving to the beach or the mountains. Congrats to the Oddpost guys, and their users and investors, and congrats to Google for getting some new worthwhile competition.

				<outline text="&quot;thinkusaalignright&quot;I saw Farenheight 9/11 today. I could enumerate all the cheap shots, all the emotional arguments that, when you follow them through, end up meaning nothing. But I won't waste your time or mine. Now I remember why I, for so many years, refused to label myself a liberal or even register as a Democrat. It's because even when the Democrats have right on their side, they don't stop there, they have to throw in the emotional bullshit, the senseless stuff, and reduce the argument to its most petty level. The war is wrong, Bush is incompetent, that's all I need to know to vote Democratic in 2004. I don't need to hear that mothers of dead soldiers' grief is unspeakably horrible. I don't care that they didn't get the full month's salary for the dead soldier's last month, and I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that the President had nothing to do with that. I hate Americans who politicize the most sacred &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;political things. It doesn't matter to me if they are left or right-wing. But I think Americans who resort to bad arguments when they have a winning case are the most despicable of all. They aren't fighting for a better, more just, smarter country, they just want to win, even if they turn off people with minds. I have no patience for that.

Still an interesting idea, imho, worth discussing perhaps. I'd be surprised if the audio version is generating huge sales, and it might be something the authors would permit, given that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.searls.com/cluetrain/&quot;&gt;full text&lt;/a&gt; of the book is already on the Web.

In the 1.5 years I was at Berkman, I never once heard John say no. And believe me, I needed a lot of yes's to make two conferences happen, one on very short notice, a day after another Berkman conference run by Charlie Nesson. Yet John pulls off what must be a very complicated job without involving you in his cares, and that's important. The internal problems fade away, and things get done.

					<outline text="The war is bad, Bush is a bad president, probably the worst of our lives. I've heard about the seven minutes of video of Bush paralyzed after the second plane hit the WTC on 9/11. Sounds powerful. Even right-wingers have to admit that a President should be someone who's mobilized by a crisis, not frozen. " created="Thu, 01 Jul 2004 12:36:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So often people overstate their case. That's Moore's mistake. When you overstate, you lose people with minds. One of the greatest things about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/30#mooresTactics&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about Moore yesterday is that I heard from right-wingers with minds. What a relief to find out they're not all like Limbaugh or O'Reilly. Seriously." created="Thu, 01 Jul 2004 12:36:47 GMT"/>
