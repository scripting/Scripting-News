In recruiting discussion leaders I look for people who seem to have a sense of blogging, they were born knowing how to do it, they have something to say, it came naturally to them. I don't look for big names, I look for people who will make good discussion leaders. People who have a passion for the subject, and (more important) have a passion for the story. It's the kind of humility that makes a successful moderator. I tell them &quot;you're a reporter&quot; and the sources are in the room. They are not an audience, they are your panel. The goal is for the conversation to stay in the room, that people who have something to contribute feel welcome to do so." created="Thu, 30 Sep 2004 01:31:06 GMT"/>

Other conferences are invitation only, how they can claim to be part of the Web is a mystery to me (the Web is inclusive, by design, it routes around exclusivity). Other conferences charge thousands of dollars for a chance to rub elbows with the rich and super-rich. Not BloggerCon. We don't charge people anything to participate. We &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; ask for donations (soon), if you can afford to kick in some money, we'll have lunch, and be able to pay for Wifi and webcasting. I always contribute my time at no charge, and I give $1000 in cash. Adam has also given $1000 each time. But you don't have to pay to participate, and everyone is invited. Why is that good? Because you don't just get one point of view, or just hear from people I like. No &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/09/29/footsie.jpg&quot;&gt;footsie&lt;/a&gt; here. I once said to someone who held an exclusive &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=a-list&quot;&gt;a-list-only&lt;/a&gt; event at BloggerCon that you know it's an open event, because if it weren't, you wouldn't be here. We encourage people to be open to others, no matter how famous they are, no matter who they're friends with. It's transparent. It's a user's conference. No speakers, no panels, no audience." created="Thu, 30 Sep 2004 02:02:44 GMT"/>

It's long been my belief that this is where political blogging will first achieve real significance, I think in two, four or six years the entire House of Representatives will be blogging. It's too good a medium for local politics. I learned at the DNC that at least one of the two major parties sees it the same way. Ed has been with the political blogging story all the way, he led the journalism discussion at BloggerCon I. He also planned and ran a successful &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;conference in August in &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/08/20&quot;&gt;Greensboro&lt;/a&gt;.

He chastised me for: 1. Criticizing his article in public. 2. Causing him trouble if he corrects his mistake and 3. Not realizing that he personally had not written that part of the article. My response is public because his article is public. Had he, or a CNET researcher, asked me about this in private, then it would have stayed private. Further, the article has &lt;i&gt;his name&lt;/i&gt; on it, so I'd be really concerned if I were him about what other misinformation it might contain, rather than somehow blaming me for CNET's incompetence. Finally, the arrogance of these reporters! Somehow one article in CNET makes him the boss of RSS-Land. The proper response would be first to apologize for giving credit for my work to others, and skip the exuses, then do some research,  correct the errors, and go on.

Then I read this on Seth Dillingham's blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truerwords.net/4263&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kernel.scripting.com/2004/09/28#a20&quot;&gt;open source release&lt;/a&gt; of Frontier. &quot;When Dave announced that the source would be released, I was determined not to let it affect me. I wouldn't let this thing I loved hurt me again. ;-) Imagine my surprise, then, when reading about the release and listening to Dave's audio commentary almost brought tears to my eyes.&quot; It never occurred to me that my audio blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/blogs/gems/dnc/cnSept27.mp3&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; would have that effect, but now that I read Seth's comment, I can see why it would. Frontier has had a huge human cost to it. It's an obession. It should have a warning label. Warning, could cost you years of your life. Many. Beware. Like Seth I'm determined not to get dragged into its vortex again. So when Wes Felter (another former devotee) posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/frontierkernel/message/76&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; challenging the one in charge to decide this or that, I just flipped the cover of the laptop, and lay down to read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/books/beginnings/9804/primary.colors.klein/&quot;&gt;political novel&lt;/a&gt; I borrowed from the library. &quot;It's a young man's thing,&quot; I said to no one at all, &quot;I gave my youth to this passion, and now both are gone.&quot;" created="Wed, 29 Sep 2004 07:17:50 GMT"/>

Jeff Sandquist previewed the audio and said he had never understood what Frontier was before. It's good that this event which is probably one of the largest releases of open source code ever, may mean that more people appreciate this interesting and unique piece of software. Or it may be a time capsule, a message in a bottle, or a bridge to the future, and that would be fine too. One thing it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; is an attempt to boil the ocean, or a threat to your favorite scripting language, Web content system or HTTP server. Just trying to preserve a life's work of programming, so it doesn't end up lost or forgotten. Peace brother. " created="Tue, 28 Sep 2004 08:57:13 GMT"/>

If I had it to do over again I would have been direct and honest when answering these questions. Basically, I don't know, it's really up to the users. If you want us to continue developing the software, you have to be sure we get enough money to do so. If you think Apple is capable of satisfying all your needs, then you have nothing to worry about. If you'd like insurance, help us stay in business. The power has always been with the users, not the platform vendor, no matter how much spin there is that says otherwise. You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; have your cake and eat it too. Developers can do something that platform vendors don't do well -- listen to users.

The right way to do it is decentralized, using a convenient XML &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; for representing and editing directories. We happen to have one, it's quite popular and has a lot more power than is being used. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2002/06/02/theGooglishWayToDoDirectories#todaysDirectories&quot;&gt;Googlish way&lt;/a&gt; to do directories, which could easily be the MSN-way to do directories, or what Yahoo can do when they're ready to give up the centralized model. It's really simple. Teach your search engine to look inside OPML files, and index them using the same page-ranking method you use for HTML. When the searcher wants to go into a directory, display it like Yahoo or DMOZ. Voila, let a thousand directories bloom. If someone tries to &quot;own&quot; a category, route around them. The Web doesn't have a single home page, why should directories? Competition is the way of the Web. " created="Sat, 25 Sep 2004 23:48:08 GMT"/>

I wouldn't like it. On the other hand, I'm absolutely sure that Fox is in the loop on the daily Republican talking points, you can see the coordination in their news programs, and I'm very angry that they do that.

Once I settled on it I no longer had to watch the time, I knew it was 50 minutes, plus or minus; and it was good in the snow (the field part was fun when the snow was deep), and I didn't have to think. I listened to all of Chris Lydon's &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt; in that mode. And NPR news. It was on that walk that I heard about Ronald Reagan's passing (I rarely took the walk in reverse, but on that day for some reason I did). I also heard about the passing of &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/09/21/palmer.jpg&quot;&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/a&gt; there too, and spent lots of time thinking about Uncle Vava who died shortly after I started taking that walk.

					<outline text="So now I'm in a new city, and trying to figure out the new walk. The first day I went toward the central library. No good, too many hills and too many stops for traffic lights. Then I tried heading over to the ballparks, pretty good --  it's flat, the traffic's not too bad, you can do a loop (always better than turning around) but it's a little on the noisy side (highway 99) and yesterday I think I found a better one, and it may be &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; one. " created="Tue, 21 Sep 2004 12:11:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's how it works. Walk to the waterfront, go north on Alaskan Way (instead of south, as I had before). The cool thing that happens is that it separates from 99, so it gets quiet, and then even better, there's a sidewalk on the harbor side of the street that has no traffic lights (because all the streets end at the water, duh). You can walk for a long way without a stop. After about 20 minutes you hit a park, and if you want to catch your breath, there are benches looking out at the harbor. It was on one of those benches yesterday that I heard Adam Curry play one of my favorite old Alice Cooper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.uol.com.br/cante/lyrics/Alice_Cooper_-_No_more_mister_nice_guy.htm&quot;&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt;. Loop around, and come up Western Ave, through Pike Place Market, and grab some fruit and head back home. The whole loop, just about an hour. No noise, very little traffic. Yes, it's very promising." created="Tue, 21 Sep 2004 12:13:11 GMT"/>

"/>
					<outline text="First, why is it important that I of all people know what Moblogging is? Okay, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musicals101.com/who6d.htm#Mostel&quot;&gt;Zero Mostel&lt;/a&gt; says, I'll tell you. (Sorry.) Blame &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nkzone.org/nkzone/&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, my former Harvard colleague, and former Tokyo bureau chief for CNN, and friend of &lt;a href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/&quot;&gt;Joi Ito&lt;/a&gt;. Rebecca keeps telling me that I must have a session about Moblogging at BloggerCon. At the closing session of the last BC, I asked the room if they felt we should have one, and everyone said yes we should. However, unless we know what Moblogging is, if we were to have a discussion about it, it seems we would spend all our time debating what it is and whether or not it belongs at a BloggerCon. Those are exactly the kinds of meta-discussions that I like to avoid. At all costs. So I want to know what it is, and if it's worth discussing."/>
					<outline text="So Scoble and I sat down for coffee with this mission in mind. To figure it out. To figure out what Moblogging is. And we did. We nailed it. We know. And now I'm going to tell you."/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Moblogging is any activity that occurs away from your normal blog-writing place whose purpose is to create content for your blog.  &lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="So, when I took &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/09/18#tully&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the coffee shop, that was moblogging."/>
					<outline text="When I wrote this explanation that was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; moblogging, since I did it at my desk, fully supported by my normal high-speed net connection, laptop, multi-gigabyte external hard disk, second monitor, USB hub, mouse, etc etc. There were no distractions that come from being in the real world, no toll booths, gas gauges, semi-trailers, weather reports, ticket takers, hot dog vendors, fish throwers, jelly tasters that demand attention above and beyond the blogging I'm doing."/>
					<outline text="I was moblogging when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/08/30#shocking&quot;&gt;crossed&lt;/a&gt; the Mississippi River in northern Minnesota, where it's just a slow-flowing &lt;a href=&quot;http://pics.scripting.com/0037/0005.jpg&quot;&gt;creek&lt;/a&gt;. If I hadn't taken the pictures and later uploaded them, I still would have been delighted and impressed, but I wouldn't have been moblogging."/>
					<outline text="When I'm driving through the corn fields of Saskatchewan recording an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/dave/coffeeNotesSeptember2.mp3&quot;&gt;audio blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I am moblogging. Here's a 15-second Quicktime &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/dave/DSCN0949.MOV&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates what it feels like to moblog while driving, from my point of view."/>
					<outline text="I am also moblogging when I almost drive off the road trying to hit pause on the recording. (In other words moblogging requires new hardware that is designed specifically for moblogging.)"/>
					<outline text="In the future I will be moblogging when I hit the big red Record button on my iPod and talk into it for a half-hour while driving across the wheat fields of Alberta and then hit the big red button again to pause the recording and save it to the internal disk of the iPod. (A low battery also causes it to be saved.) I will be moblogging when I &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; drive off the road into one of the wheat fields. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Before we came up with this definition, we were fumbling around trying to figure out if moblogging was more than taking pictures of things with cell phones and having them uploaded to some central server so we could point to them from our blogs. Yes yes, moblogging is more than that, it's a way of blogging, perhaps even a way of living. It's important and fully capable of supporting a 1.5 hour discussion at Bloggercon. "/>

Shouldn't the publisher have the right to opt-out? Right now there is no mechanism that's broadly supported by aggregators. This has come up many times but always gets mired in the usual hand-wringing and second-guessing of the XML mail lists. If you were looking for a use-case, consider the NY Times Olympics &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/userland/Olympics.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/09/15/feedWindsDown.gif&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of their latest entry. Now the Times presumably can configure their server in a couple of weeks to tell aggregators that the resource is gone. Even so, many aggregators won't notice and will keep polling indefinitely. And many content people can't change their server in this way. I'm no longer on the RSS advisory board, so I won't be playing a role in solving the problem, but it needs to be solved.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://onesimplequestion.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Another question&lt;/a&gt; for George Bush: How many times have you been arrested? Usually you wouldn't ask a sitting President a shameful question like this. But then a sitting President wouldn't challenge the honor of an opponent who risked his life for his country, while he used his daddy's influence to save his. As I've said before, during Vietnam, getting out of the draft was one of the things people were doing, it's not something to be ashamed of (that's why it's wrong for the Democrats to use this as a negative against Bush). But it's much worse to take shots at people who fought in Vietnam. This was one of the shames of the Vietnam era, that we didn't separate the failed war from the honor of the soldiers who did their duty. They came home to face a shame that wasn't theirs, it belonged to LBJ and Nixon, and the other leaders who got us into the quagmire. Today, Bush and his cronies perpetuate that shame. So he deserves to be asked shameful questions, and if he doesn't want to be asked then, he should be more careful about shaming Kerry." created="Fri, 10 Sep 2004 21:03:12 GMT"/>

That's going to become painfully obvious when they try to hold elections in Iraq in January. The people holding the elections will control none of the country. Meanwhile, the US deficit grows to fund this miserable no-win war, jobs move overseas, the US economy is serving the upper class more and more, and the people who voted for Bush on the ridiculous promise that they too could be part of the upper class, will feel like they screwed themselves. They will have screwed the rest of us too. Never has a ticket had so little to offer as George Bush and Dick Cheney do.

" created="Thu, 09 Sep 2004 15:40:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The rule my doctors told me, which proved to be right in my case, is that after one month you're halfway back, then after two months, three-quarters, and so on. Every month you split the distance to the goal. A year after the surgery you're functioning pretty well, in fact probably &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than you were before the surgery, because your heart wasn't working very well beforehand. " created="Thu, 09 Sep 2004 15:54:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thing that seems to be true for all bypass survivors is that they put off seeing the heart doctor long after they know they have a problem. I explained this to a friend this way. Up to that point in your life you had worked through every physical problem through exercise, diet and rest, and it worked; esp muscle ills (the heart is a muscle). But this is the first time for many people (it was for me, and probably for Clinton too) that you couldn't exercise your way back to health. I think a lot of people die because of ths mistake.

I didn't know that Henry Kissinger had bypass 20 years ago, as did Dick Cheney. They're still walking around. Now what my cardiologist said makes more sense.

So why bother caring what you think while you're alive. So much time is wasted trying to prove you're right. You're not right, neither am I. " created="Thu, 09 Sep 2004 15:48:56 GMT"/>

How much happier they would be if they stopped caring about being right. Having a lover who wants to be with you can be a totally joyous thing, but people make it so complicated. Do yourself a favor, write off the idea of being right, and just seek pleasure and helping other people, esp the person you love, and by all means help yourself.

I remember hearing him speak at Davos in 2000, he was an inspiration.

Russ Beattie, for example, had a succinct, practical and negative &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008013.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of Apple's new desktop computer.

Generally I'm too wiped out after a day of exploring the northland to have much energy left for creativity before falling asleep. But not so in the morning. Even without coffee, I'm rarin to go!
