There actually is some validity to the developer complaint, and there's a lot to be said for licking your wounds quietly esp when you produce software of great utility but limited depth. What's good is that developers are starting to care about other developers. That's important. Create strategies together that build on each others' strengths. There's no power in complaining about Apple, of course they can add features to their OS, esp ones that link back to the Macintosh of 1984. But if you all viewed the Mac OS as a collaborative development platform, you could market your stuff independent of Apple. Now that would be &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more revolutionary than a pretty collection of useful widgets.

I was reminded of the student strikes we'd do in the late 60s and early 70s. First have an organizing meeting with the steering committee, print up the leaflets, hand them out, march somewhere, sit-in the lobby of the school, maybe get on TV, whatever, and then what? They were great affairs while we were expressing our outrage, but in the end, we had to go back to school, get good grades, get accepted at good colleges, etc etc. We possibly helped end the war sooner, in some way (although the right-wingers said we did the opposite). It certainly was a lot more fun than sitting in a classroom, getting good grades, etc. We used to joke that we didn't do too many strikes in the winter, mostly they were in April and May when the weather was too good to be caught up inside a classroom.

					<outline text="Anyway, seeing the list of formats that Apple supports, RSS 0.91, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, Atom, I sighed on behalf of Atom and poor not-respected-by-geeks RSS. Reminds me of what my doctor said when I showed up for an annual checkup five pounds heavier than the year before. I shrugged it off, not too bad I said. She said &quot;But you're going in the wrong direction.&quot; Sure, people say that it doesn't matter how many formats there are, but it actually &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; matter, even for users, as I've said repeatedly, every new format is another brick in the wall of Barrier To Entry, and that means less choice, but it also might make it harder for efforts that build on RSS to get started.

					<outline text="Yesterday, I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/29#When:9:34:50AM&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; about a great BitTorrent-with-RSS application. I saw the URL to the feed, and groaned. It's RDF. Now, all the BT+RSS apps have been built around &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; because it has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt; element, and we'd never, as far as I know, anticipated that the RSS confusion would creep into this space. I looked at the file to see how they did it, and whoa, it's a 2.0 file, even though on the outside it says it's RDF. Once you combine RSS with other things, which definitely should be happening more, you add another dimension with the two other flavors. Instead of having to do something once, you have to do it three times. And that's more than three times the trouble, which makes it less than one-third as likely to happen.

The current standards organizations have the wrong strategy, they get in the way of progress instead of fostering it. After years of studying this, I now think we need a new standards organization that adopts de facto standards, like BitTorrent and RSS, OPML, XML-RPC, the ones with market momentum, that have proven their value. The current SO's form committees and bureaucracies, that's their purpose it seems, and by the time they're ready with a format or protocol, their proposal is too complex and too late.

I've gotten a bunch of interesting responses, not with offers, but with ideas about what I should do next. Someone said I should be an entrepreneur-in-residence at a VC firm. Interesting idea. Yesterday I had dinner with a friend who's well-connected in financial circles in Boston and Silicon Valley to talk about something like that. We surveyed the landscape of companies doing stuff in and around the technologies I've worked on. Aggregators, blogging, formats, protocols, etc. It turns out I do have a pretty good understanding of the companies, products and individuals. But I'm not sure if EIR is the right thing, because honestly I don't see myself putting in the 18 hour days, seven day weeks, to crank out the 1.0s. I said I wished we had hooked up five years ago when that's what I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; doing. I've also got a possible career in academia, with a good credential on my resume, the 1.5 year stint at Berkman Center. It's true, I love to teach. Maybe some place exotic like New Mexico or Geneva.

					<outline text="One reason to keep the number of formats small, and require strict XML compliance, is to keep the barriers to entry low, so that little hacks are possible. For example, three years ago we were &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2001/06/27#theUgliestBitOfEngineering&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; on ways to circumvent Microsoft's Smart Tags, a horrible idea. It was one of the few times I've ever seen a company being so openly evil, thumbing their nose at the legal system, the Bill of Rights, publishers and writers, and any semblance of fair competition. I had to write a filter that would process every page to add a meta tag that would tell Microsoft to keep their &quot;smart&quot; tags off the page. Because HTML was such a bloody mess, the script couldn't just parse it and add the metadata where it was needed, it had to use string pattern matching and guess where to put the data, and usually it was right, but sometimes not. " created="Sun, 27 Jun 2004 13:25:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I first learned about XML in 1997, I thought I understood that we were going to fix this problem with HTML, and &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; that processors be strict about rejecting not-well-formed feeds. I was surprised to find that not all developers feel this way. I think it's wrong that some aggregators work around well-formedness problems in feeds. These guys are building barriers to entry. They say users don't care, but the users &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; care, and if we state our case clearly and respectfully, they can. " created="Sun, 27 Jun 2004 13:29:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've seen people say there's no harm in having a third syndication format, so I tried out an idea, what about a fourth? They say no, we don't need it. I agree. I didn't think we needed a second or third either, and still don't. The more formats, the more chance for lock-in. Watch out for companies that only care about interop with Microsoft, that's how the promise of SOAP was destroyed. And watch out for Microsoft, when they come into this space, let's be sure they don't invent their own format and make vague promises about interop. I'm sure even my friends at Microsoft can appreciate the concern. Not everyone at MS understands why the developer community is important. If ever it was in doubt, pause at this moment, and reflect on how the pub-sub application came to be. None of the big companies had anything to do with it. Sure, some of them will buy their way into it. And some are going to bully their way in. But maybe some will get in by producing excellent software that performs great, and doesn't try to win by locking out individual developers. " created="Sun, 27 Jun 2004 13:32:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/postelsLaw&quot;&gt;Postel's Law&lt;/a&gt; has two parts. This is something a lot of people don't want you to look at, they only want you to think about the first part, the part which XML says is not a great idea -- be liberal in what you accept. This tends to favor the big guys who have the resources to catch up, and then the chutzpah to throw a big fat hairball into the middle of the market, one that no one else can handle. Maybe Postel didn't live in a world where these big companies could create such big messes, but I have had to deal with them, many times in my career, and they usually end competitive markets. A lot of well-intentioned people in the syndication community don't have the benefit of this experience, and we may have to learn this once again for their benefit. I hope not." created="Sun, 27 Jun 2004 13:36:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But the second part of Postel's Law is brilliant, and if we believed in it and bet on it, we'd never have to deal with the flaws in the first part. If we looked for ways to reduce variability, to do things the same way whenever possible, we'd keep the barriers low, keep the flow of cool hacks high, and be prepared to face any challenge that might come our way.

There was a time when most of the people who produced RSS and used RSS did it with my software. At that point there would have been an option to close it up, and not allow others to enter the market. But that was never what I wanted to do. I've always believed in the power of developers working together. I still hold out some hope for that. By stepping aside, I remove one oft-stated reason for people not working together. How ironic, that the thing I wanted most, may only be possible without me. Anyway, life is filled with mysteries.

Frankly, most of the time I was spending on the board has been in avoiding and dealing with flamers, which as others have noted is not a good use of my time. Now that I'm leaving Harvard, I want to spend much of my technical work time on the open source release of the Frontier kernel and other forward-looking projects. I want to be out of the business of avoiding flames, if possible.

I've been aware of it, of course, when I started there were no weblogs, but every other blog after mine had an example, either this site, or some site or sites that learned from it. But the really chilling thing Mark noted was that when people break away, they often do it in a way that seems vengeful, which is where the &lt;i&gt;No good deed goes unpunished&lt;/i&gt; feeling comes from. Lots of examples of this. I said to Mark I don't begrudge people their need to break away, but why not do it in a nice way, like point back to me as you pass me in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/top100.html&quot;&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt; rankings? Send some flow back to your old teacher? Then I remembered, that I wasn't entirely without a mentor in this. I owe many of the ideas and encouragement I received to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/mouse_pr.html&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart&lt;/a&gt;, an engineer who, whether you know it or not, you owe a lot to, too. When you want to change the world, I've noted, the best way to do it is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dovercourt.edu.sg/new_page_3.htm&quot;&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; by example. So thanks Doug for being not only a great generous thinker, but a personal inspiration. Your work has made a huge difference to me and many others. A true bootstrap. With much love, thank you." created="Thu, 24 Jun 2004 05:07:38 GMT" type="outline"/>

That totally increased the pressure, because the users were the ones who &lt;i&gt;weren't&lt;/i&gt; freaking. And how much was at stake? Hmmm. Project the revenue from a couple hundred people with free weblogs. Some kind of gold mine? An amazing lack of perspective. I saw other competitors do horrible things that week. Only Evan Williams &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evhead.com/2004/06/sideline-bashers.asp&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; the right thing, he did what he could to put it in perspective.

And then Linux is derived from Unix, it's Linus's &quot;ix.&quot; This is good, it's called standing on the shoulders of giants. It's respectful. There's another family of ancient operating systems (let's see if I get this right). First there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT-11&quot;&gt;RT-11&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsts&quot;&gt;RSTS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M&quot;&gt;CP/M&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS&quot;&gt;MS-DOS&lt;/a&gt; (also known as PC-DOS, same thing), and finally MS-Windows. They all shared the same command structure, and at least for CP/M and MS-DOS and Windows, a common API. Windows went much further, and RSTS was multi-tasking. So while the Unix thread was scaling down, the RT-11 thread was beefing up. Meantime Macintosh OS was a wholly different thread, and it was not well-known that the pretty icons rested on a fairly powerful and well-designed DOS with a simple multi-tasking design. It worked. We were able to build interapplication communication on it. " created="Sun, 20 Jun 2004 22:07:52 GMT" type="outline"/>

And a &lt;a href=&quot;http://buzzword.com/backupMySite&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that creates a backup copy of a site (please please use it). So the first part of the transition is complete. Unless something goes wrong, there's only one more step, which will happen gradually over the next week, redirecting the old URLs to the new ones. We have to do this slowly and watch carefully because this will put the stress on the system that caused the outage last weekend. We may have to optimize, or only redirect the sites that are being maintained. No matter what they'll get the highest priority. But the biggest part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://newhome.weblogs.com/hostingTransitionPlan&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/a&gt; is now complete. Happy.

Yesterday, talking with Steve Gillmor, he asked me about Steve Kirks. I told him Steve is super-smart, young, ambitious, a learning sponge, tough, but fair. As I described him, I said he's like the people I like to work with. I said &quot;like Brent Simmons,&quot; knowing that Gillmor knows Brent.

I asked him, in an email, when have you known me to cut a corner? And I said next time, and there will be a next time, it would be nice if the people who know me, would say publicly that I am honest and hard-working, and to give me a chance. The reason so many of these people say ever-more-damning things about my integrity, is that no challenges them. Every time it's like starting from zero, I have to prove that I'm not the cretin they cast me as.

					<outline text="I don't care about the people who attack, I know they're trying to get me to care, but I've been through this so many times, I can see how they're working. They don't even try to tell the truth anymore, probably because they know no one will check up on them, and if they act like they know me well, lots of people will assume they do. Mark Pilgrim showed me how this works, by talking about decisions I made, as if he were there, when they happened &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; before he was involved. Sam Ruby is starting to do the same thing (or at least not objecting when other people assume he's not the newbie that he is). Other people don't tell you why they have &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; reasons to be bitter, and why people, if they knew, would take what they say with a grain of salt, and maybe even be appalled at how they're being used. What really gets to me is how people who say they're my friend, stand by, and say nothing. When that happens, we cross off friendship as an option. Friends stand beside friends, even if it causes a bit of conflict. I've learned that friendship is a very rare thing, or maybe other people don't consider the importance of the glass ball, but I thought I should say that it's this standing-alone-thing that is most hurtful, to me. And I think it's why they choose me to attack, by the way. After years of service, actually decades, I feel I have earned the benefit of the doubt.

The second wrong meme is that I should have or could have given more notice. Putting a note on Scripting News wouldn't have been notice. I've tried to communicate with free-hosting users through this site many times. It doesn't work. Most of them don't read it. Email wouldn't have worked either because most of the email addresses are dead, and had I sent them, the outrage would have been about spam (read the Register &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/winer_weblog_wipeout/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for an idea). Spam filters of course would have stopped most of the messages that had email addresses that hadn't gone out of date.

Well I don't accept that. I won't deal with hysterical people. I'm not running for president, I am not a corporate executive, and I don't tell bedtime stories to adults unless its for fun and they're friends. I can tell you what it feels like to be me, but I don't know how it feels to be you. I'm willing to listen, up to a point, but unless your site is hosted on weblogs.com, I don't understand why you're hogging the microphone right now.

I am now hosting the weblogs.com sites started in Y2K, most of which are inactive (or so it seems, I've yet to quantify this). All of a sudden I'm hosting hundreds of inactive RSS feeds, and since this base of sites was where RSS was bootstrapped, there are a fair number of subscribers.

A couple of years ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/stories/storyReader$19964&quot;&gt;proposed a way&lt;/a&gt; to do this, but as far as I know only Radio and NetNewsWire support it.

I've heard this before of course, but the fact is, a lot of people &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; change how their HTTP server works. Still it's important that they be able to tell aggregators that their feed has moved, or that their feed is finished. It's so disheartening to see this constantly reduced to religious terms, when it's a user issue. Further, Hammersley is not an independent observer, as this post clearly shows, he has a strong partisan opinion. Even so, the Guardian, a respected UK publication, has assigned him to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1171185,00.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on developments in the RSS community as if he were independent.

In San Rafael, I passed the Marin Civic Center, which had a big electronic billboard facing the highway, one where the message can vary depending on what's going on. That day the sign simply said http:\//www.marin.org/. I bet just one in a thousand of the drivers knew what that weird word meant. But &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; knew and I laughed out loud because it was such a cool use of technology, and a harbinger of things to come. Today it wouldn't even make an impression because URLs are so commonplace, in fact, you'd probably be surprised if they &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; tell you how to find them on the Web. Now I'm not going to tell you I know for a fact that the white-on-orange thingies are going to be as ubiquitous as Web URLs in the physical world, but maybe they will be, and it doesn't hurt anyone to see a little thing they don't understand, happens every day, all over the world, and somehow we survive. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sat, 12 Jun 2004 11:14:01 GMT" type="outline"/>

They're a hedge by investors, in case Plan A doesn't work (selling a product to customers) perhaps Plan B might (suing to get money from companies who sell products to customers). Deaf, dumb and blind are the customers themselves, who might act in their own interest and only buy products from non-patent abusers.

He was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campusprogram.com/reference/en/wikipedia/j/ja/james_g__watt.html&quot;&gt;pariah&lt;/a&gt; during the 80s. Not no more. Now he's a man of Great Inner Peace because he served under the mighty Reagan. Hoi. The press only deals with stories in the extreme. Tomorrow on Meet The Press, Russert will be trying to trick some current politico into actually saying something. And twenty years from now, when that same person is dead, they'll be saying what a religious experience it was being around him. Feh. Reagan was a smelly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/presfacts/reagan.html&quot;&gt;old dude&lt;/a&gt;, even when he was Prez.

The Guardian, in a deeply flawed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1171185,00.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, said something very different about the origins of RSS. One wonders how they would react if I claimed to write an article of theirs that made a big difference in the world. You launch so many ideas, when one succeeds, it's nice to get credit for it. Anyway, there's no doubt why one got the story right and one didn't. The WSJ assigned a reporter, and he thoroughly researched it. The Guardian assigned a politician, and he wrote an ad for his cause, and they ran it as a news article. I hear that journalism works differently in the UK. Damn right about that.

					<outline text="This is the arrogance of big media. They are not accountable to their readers, or to the subjects of their coverage. We're supposed to accept whatever they pass off as journalism. A software developer that worked this way, on receipt of a bug report from a user, would simply blame the user for the bug, and when that didn't work, say it's not a bug at all. Now certainly some developers do this, but we are harshly critical of them. It's time to apply the same standards to journalists. They often claim their thorough research sets them apart from bloggers, but when it clearly doesn't, they don't respond." created="Wed, 02 Jun 2004 12:17:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's an op-ed piece that's not labeled as such, and no opportunity was provided for an opposing point of view. An even more thorough investigation would show that the points Hammersley made are straight from the hype on the mailing lists, but this time they appear under the banner of a respected publication. This not only gives a black eye to the technologists, but it also discredits The Guardian. " created="Wed, 02 Jun 2004 12:19:27 GMT"/>

I don't know much about it, and I don't sign up for political causes I don't know much about.

I don't think bloggerdom should be used like TV talk shows. I said I don't stand up for causes I don't understand. I guess that's a polite way of saying that I don't even &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; what they're doing. I think we need to get over ourselves in America, our time is just about over, unless we stop guzzling so much gas and start electing leaders with brains, morals and courage. I feel I have to say I like Jeff, I really do, he's come through for me twice at BloggerCon, and I appreciate that. But his politics are 180 degrees opposite mine, even on tactics. I think the best thing the US can do for the world is get our own house in order and stop trying to fix the world, something we're exceedingly bad at." created="Tue, 01 Jun 2004 13:35:33 GMT" type="outline"/>
