Good: The food is spicy and rich. Bad: And fattening. Neither good or bad: People are s-l-o-w-e-r. At first, to a person from one of the coasts this can be maddening, but you get used to it. (That's based on memory.) Bad: Conventional wisdom has it that east coast drivers are aggressive and west coast drivers are passive. But southern drivers can be mindless, and every so often there's a bubba with a huge fwd pickup who weaves in and out of traffic as if the other cars were slalom poles. Bad: Church groups in hotels. A bus pulls up to a hotel with 25 kids and 2 adults, rents four rooms (always on the floor I'm on) and then uses the hallway as if it were the common area between their rooms.

In September, when I was driving east to west, it was often hard to find a hotel with Internet. There's been a big change in the last few months. It won't be much longer before Internet service will be taken for granted, like cable TV, or the little bottles of shampoo. I wonder how long it will be before they stop putting telephones in new hotels. I can't imagine many people use them, given that cell phones are so much cheaper. One other note, when I was driving east in March 2003, my Sprint cell phone was useless. (Also a few months ago, but that was mostly in Canada, a different country, of course.) On this trip, my AT&amp;T phone has had almost complete coverage, including some of the emptiest parts of Arizona and New Mexico. I had an hour on the phone with Adam a couple of days ago, on a stretch of highway where rest areas were &lt;i&gt;over 100 miles apart.&lt;/i&gt; Full cell coverage the whole way.

I may understand why people seem to write me out of the stories of mine they rewrite. Mitch Kapor says we're all spending our careers implementing Dave Winer's ideas. That's nice but I always implement my ideas first, and sometimes it takes an amazingly long time for the cloners to clone them, and they usually don't get it right, and that includes Mitch. I kinda wish he'd &lt;i&gt;work with me,&lt;/i&gt; rather than keep trying to take over my ideas. But it's nice now that he's giving me credit, he didn't used to. Anyway, talking with Adam yesterday I remarked that people seem to like getting ideas from him, but they don't like getting them from me. Then I talked with Scoble at length, and he said something similar about himself, that he works hard to be liked, and that I don't. The weird thing is that Scoble is just beginning to get the taste of people not liking him, but any good editor will tell you something's wrong if you're a reporter and everyone likes you. And if we're citizen journalists, I guess we have to get used to this. Anyway, it's really hard to get motivated to deliver more innovative shit, knowing that it's going to be just as hard the 53rd time to get people to suspend their disbelief as it was the 1st.

					<outline text="Actually it turns out I do have a few things on my mind. " created="Tue, 28 Dec 2004 16:02:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, the scale of the human tragedy of the tsunami. An interview on CNN with a young rock climber from Hawaii, vacationing in Thailand, talks about how only a few of her colleagues died. In normal times, the few that died would be the story. Many of the people they interview are shaking and crying, many hours after the tragedy. It's the rare thing, a real story involving human beings." created="Tue, 28 Dec 2004 16:07:36 GMT"/>

The Republicans who defend the war say Iraqis were suffering under Saddam, okay, this is a lot of suffering and unlike the Iraqi suffering, this has a solution, money spent here will rebuild and there won't be &quot;insurgents&quot; to tear down the repairs and kill our people as they try to help. " created="Tue, 28 Dec 2004 16:07:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Third, and I know there's no chance of this making a difference, maybe the Iraqis could put down their guns, stop beheading people, stop blowing things up, elect a damned government, and let us leave so we can have a future and so we can help when other tragedies happen. I'm sorry we invaded, and I'm sorry we re-elected the monster that invaded you. Now we have to go. It's just a feeling I have. The problems of the Iraqis seem so small when compared to the problems of Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia. The problem in Iraq is in their minds. Can't they solve it? We sure can't." created="Tue, 28 Dec 2004 16:09:07 GMT"/>

Here's an even more radical idea. Advertiser takes ad and puts it on his or her own website and waits for people to come read it. No one comes? Rewrite the ad. Still no one? Rewrite again. Eventually, if your product is any good, people will come, read it, buy your product, be happy customers, tell their friends, come back for more, etc. Think about how many commercial messages you &lt;i&gt;seek out&lt;/i&gt; every day? Now you gotta wonder why advertisers are willing to pay good money to try to force a &quot;message&quot; on people who don't care. John's idea goes part of the way.

					<outline text="This question comes up from time to time, and I've resisted answering it directly, thinking that anyone who really read the spec would come to the conclusion that RSS allows zero or one enclosures per item, and no more. The same is true for all other &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#hrelementsOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;sub-elements&lt;/a&gt; of item, except &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltcategorygtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt;, where multiple elements are explicitly allowed. The spec refers to &quot;the enclosure&quot; in the singular. Regardless, some people persist in thinking that you may have more than one enclosure per item. " created="Tue, 21 Dec 2004 17:43:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay, let's play it out. So if I have more than one enclosure per item, how do I specify the publication date for each enclosure? How do I specify the title, author, a link to comments, a description perhaps, or a guid? The people who want multiple enclosures suggest schemes that are so complicated that they're reduced to hand-waving before they get to the spec, which I would love to read, if it could be written. Some times some things are just too hard to do. This is one of them." created="Tue, 21 Dec 2004 17:47:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And there's a reason why it's too hard. Because you're throwing out the value of RSS and then trying to figure out how to bring it back. There's no need for items any more, so you might as well get rid of them. At the top level of channel would be a series of enclosures, and then underneath each enclosure, all the meta-data. Voila, problem solved. Only what have you actually solved? You've just re-created RSS, but instead of calling the main elements &quot;item&quot; we now call them &quot;enclosure&quot;.

" created="Tue, 21 Dec 2004 17:52:16 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Next comment. The red states have superior morals to the blue states, or so we hear. They go to church, they're evangelists, born again. Even though there are actually churches in the big cities (like Boston for example) they seem to hold the high ground. They have wholesome lives. Their kids finish school and live in good neighborhoods and have great kids who are evangelists and born again, etc etc. Yeah, except when they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/19/missouri.fetus/&quot;&gt;murder a stranger&lt;/a&gt; to forcefully remove a fetus from her womb while she's dying, and then claim it as her own. She's a good church-going Christian, her neighbors say, how could she do such a thing? Maybe it's time for all of us to relax a bit on who's superior, and realize we're Americans, all of us, and take the good with the not so good, and work together to solve some problems.

He'll reconnect with reality in a few hours in a strange dark place, and find a tiny ray of thought, an image, then a concept, then hear a voice, it gets louder, eyes flicker, there's another person here. When you wake up you can't speak because there's a tube down your throat, but you can signal with your hands, and they yank the tube out and start feeding you ice cubes and pain killers. After a few hours of this, it's time for breakfast, but get this, you have to get out of bed to eat it, and you do. This is the first step down a long road to recovery. It's risky surgery, but I think my friend will make it. I pray that he makes it. We have so much still to do, together. " created="Fri, 17 Dec 2004 13:09:22 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I've gotten lots of email on the trusting Google story below, and I'll write more about it in the coming days, I'm sure. Trust and software companies is a big deal, if the companies understood before trust became their major issue they probably would have done things differently. Microsoft, the dominant tech company in Seattle, where I now live (at least for the next few days), deals with this. They would be much further along, imho, had they not been so incredibly aggressive with their competitors, catching small developers and their users in the crossfire. When it came time to promote Passport as a universal identity system for the Internet, there was no trust left, and it flopped. Too bad, because at that time we desperately needed a universal identity system. They needed one too. " created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 21:26:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, Microsoft being Microsoft they didn't give up, and Passport has tens of millions of identities anyway (to use MSN you need one), but every day we all pay for the lack of a standard. For example, a few minutes ago when I bought an hour of Wifi here at Logan I got yet another new identity. That's so ridiculous, such a waste of time, and so dangerous. " created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 21:33:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Google still largely has the trust needed to make things like bringing academic libraries on the Internet work, and &lt;i&gt;that's a good thing. &lt;/i&gt;They might even have enough trust to make a universal identity system work where Microsoft couldn't. But they can't if they aren't serious about trust. All it takes is one major mistake to make it melt down. And once it's gone it doesn't come back." created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 21:33:44 GMT"/>

In the end their recall probably didn't save any lives, but there's little doubt that because of the scare, the &lt;i&gt;product&lt;/i&gt; would have died. By quickly taking it off the shelves, visibly showing concern for their users, at a huge cost to the company, they earned our trust, and the brand came back big. You never see tech companies with that kind of vision, that kind of understanding of their relationship to the user, or to be plain, that kind of caring for people.

					<outline text="I've finally had a chance to catch up on the coverage, and most analyses omit an important fact. News coverage starts out with one story, but by the third or fourth paragraph zeroes in on the much smaller reality. The libraries are only providing material that is not subject to copyright. Makes sense, because if it has a copyright it isn't theirs to provide. This means that a huge chunk of material is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going online, our recent history, the 20th and 21st centuries. " created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 10:06:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another angle, is this really a private deal just for Google? A lot of the coverage implies that it is. I just can't believe that the universities granted Google exclusivity on their collections, even if they are paying for digitizing it. (According to Google it's not exclusive.)" created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 10:06:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Third, everyone says that Google is trustworthy at least for now. I've heard it said on The Gillmor Gang episode about storing our data on the net. Google is storing our data, and they guess it's all right because they aren't evil. Rosenberg says we trust them with our history, with our eyes open, because the non-evil people running Google today won't be running it tomorrow. This is the big issue raised by every extension of Google's role into our lives, and it's one that has never been adequately addressed, imho." created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 10:07:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay, first a disclaimer, Google very generously supported my last conference, and they've said privately that they will undo the evil stuff they did in the past, but they haven't done it yet, and they didn't buy my silence, nor should they want to. But Google took some cheap shots at a technology that wasn't doing them any harm, for no apparent reason other than arrogance. This is exactly the kind of stuff you want to watch out for, from high tech giants we want to trust. " created="Wed, 15 Dec 2004 10:14:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now people will say they don't understand the issues, and of course they knew you wouldn't understand them, and who's to say you will understand the issues in the future. I've had exactly this kind conversation with Scott, never reached resolution. But if trust is an issue, and someone who has your trust says there's an issue, I think you ought to factor that in.

					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Net-net, Google has become such an important company that their public statement of ethics needs to be more than three cute words, and they need to have a systematic way of handling and responding to challenges.

					<outline text="Another way of looking at it: What if Microsoft were doing what Google is doing? Of course we wouldn't let them do it without a very serious and probably very shrill examination. Well, I'm telling you, Google today is as dangerous as Microsoft, and I wouldn't bet on their trustworthyness, not without a lot more light having been shed on this.

Before the 20th Century we made our own entertainment, we entertained each other. Creativity was distributed. Along comes TV, radio, phonographs, CDs, mass produced print, and all of a sudden only the very best and most commercial of us are allowed to create. Now we're flipping back, because we can do mass distribution of micro-produced content. To the surprise and perhaps chagrin of the people on the last panel of the morning, this &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; flip around the equation in both business and politics.

					<outline text="I'd like to correct one thing in Berlind's story. He says Scripting News doesn't use titles, but that's not always true. I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; use titles, for longer essay-like pieces that actually have them. To illustrate, I gave this item a title, which you'll see &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/12/08#iCanPutTitlesOnPostsOnScriptingNews&quot;&gt;in the HTML&lt;/a&gt; as the text to the left of the blue arrow, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/rss/2004/12/08&quot;&gt;in the RSS&lt;/a&gt;, using the title element." created="Wed, 08 Dec 2004 10:32:10 GMT"/>

					<outline text="One more correction (see how in these longer items I can write multiple paragraphs in one item), the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.scripting.com/rssAggregator&quot;&gt;aggregator&lt;/a&gt; I showed him is part of UserLand's &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; blogging tool, which is one of the most under-appreciated tools out there, and one of the first, as well.

					<outline text="Another comment (this post just keeps going!) -- it's really not so difficult to come up with a decent representation for a RSS item, it's more on the order of giving a good haircut than doing abdominal surgery. The amount of technical skill required is probably about the same as that required to be a barber. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this.

He had his kidney transplant on Friday. He sounded weak, but there was a quality to his voice, a certain health, that I don't think I had ever heard before. He was up, out of bed already, sitting in a chair. He said he couldn't believe how hard it was to get there. They don't let you lie around after surgery because that's how you get pneumonia. When I had my heart surgery two years ago, they got me out of bed the very next morning to eat my breakfast. No breakfast in bed for this pup. Anyway, I hardly know what to think about Dave. I've known for over ten years that this day was coming. For quite a while it seemed it never would.

First, Halo 2 shipped with RSS 2.0 support. Who thought of RSS for games? It wasn't even on our radar. Then yesterday MSN Spaces, a blogging system, shipped with RSS 2.0 support. And the third bit was pinging weblogs.com. Now I'm &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; we'll be able to turn the corner for two reasons. First, we got a huge response from serious developers, and several credible projects started today, in a variety of environments. Since eventually this will have to be a distributed system, like DNS, it's important to have a variety of compatible implementations. Second, Andre and I did a back and forth on this over a few hours. Andre used to be responsible for the kernel at UserLand years ago, and now is back in the loop after the Frontier open source release. He asked me some questions, I sent him the source, we put in some diagnostics, tested a theory and boom, all of a sudden the server is performing beautifully. We still have the scaling issue but we got some breathing room today. Anyway, thanks to Microsoft for trusting us and using our formats and protocols.

				<outline text="Okay, another ethical question. I got two emails at exactly the same time, the first came from an individual employee, Mr G, at a company named, for the sake of argument, MacroHard. This email was in response to a question I sent to him earlier today, because I was pretty sure the project he was working on was about to &quot;go live&quot; and I wanted to get briefed on it before-hand. My email didn't say any of this, I just said &quot;How's XXX doing?&quot; where XXX is the name of the project. Now get this: his email had a link to a post on his weblog, where he refers to the project as being live, and points to the draft press release. Okay, sounds like it's ready to go. But the next email says otherwise. Very clearly it says the project is ready to go, but the press release won't run until 9PM Pacific, tonight, and we can't write about it before then. Obviously the individual, Mr G, didn't get this message, or he wouldn't have sent me the URL to the press release without conditions. Bzzzt. I just got a call from the PR guy. The AP broke the embargo, that's why Mr G pulled the trigger. The product is MSN Spaces. See the links above." created="Thu, 02 Dec 2004 01:49:43 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="When I started blogging it was mostly to get a bunch of stuff off my plate, ideas I couldn't do anything with, things I wanted even if I couldn't create them myself. I hoped other people would read this stuff and someone would create what I wanted, and therefore increase happiness. Over the years I learned that this very rarely happens. People really want to come up with the ideas, even more than they want to be successful. "/>
