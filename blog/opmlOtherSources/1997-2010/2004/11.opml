I had already asked enough people which works best, and wanted a service that worked in Europe so that pointed to AT&amp;T with an inexpensive Nokia phone. Three weeks later, I'm still happy with the purchase. The service is a lot better. I've also been talking for the last year about getting a new car, and I'm not going to wait for the old one to break. Here's what I'm looking for, and I'm soliciting advice. 1. A large interior with lots of space for all the junk I move around. My SUV has a lot of space, but it's organized for four passengers, and I very rarely have more than two. 2. Decent gas mileage, but certainly not great gas mileage. 3. Excellent GPS navigation system. 4. Handles well, doesn't require  alot of maintenence. So... all this put together suggests some kind of minivan, or maybe a smallish regular van.

It's fair approach to interop, it treats big software companies with patents and open source projects with large installed bases, and smart consultants with their own implementations, as equals. Basically the door is open to all, the playing field is totally level, and interop with each one is considered important, and until it's reached, &lt;i&gt;no one gets to claim interop. &lt;/i&gt;Unfortunately Microsoft and IBM didn't want to play by these very fair rules, and went ahead worked privately with each other and tried to force it on everyone else. The usual way interop is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; achieved in the software biz. Eventually interop came to mean &quot;Works With Microsoft&quot; but since Microsoft's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html&quot;&gt;architecture astronauts&lt;/a&gt; were in charge, well, SOAP is pretty dead in 2004, sadly, because a handful of people spoiled it for everyone else.

Anyway, I also found an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebeatles.com/capitolAlbums/&quot;&gt;Beatles site&lt;/a&gt;, with excerpts from all the songs, video of interviews with the band. I've learned something new and important. Paul McCartney was the lead singer. It was never clear to me who was singing on the old songs. I thought John Lennon's style developed over the years, but it turns out he always sang the same way, he just didn't sing many of the songs. John gave a better &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beatlesagain.com/bapology.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, but Paul was the nicer guy, simpler, more commercial, for sure, but he did most of the work, it seems. I always thought I liked John better, he was the poet of the band, but then I found out that Paul wrote Hey Jude, Let It Be, Lady Madonna, and of course all the &quot;silly love songs.&quot; Now I could learn more, and I expect to, but it seems that Paul got a pretty shitty deal from John." created="Wed, 24 Nov 2004 21:36:22 GMT" type="outline"/>

When I drive on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIE&quot;&gt;Long Island Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, I see trucks. You might argue that the trucks should just disappear into the background, and I would &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; agree.

Of course, literally speaking, my statement was correct, in two ways. First, Giuliani is in fact a citizen. Second, Schwarzenegger is a &lt;i&gt;naturalized&lt;/i&gt; citizen, so it's accurate to point out that Giuliani is a plain old citizen. My mom admitted she was standing up for Arnie because she also is a naturalized citizen. I of course am not, and could serve as President without an amendment.

Most of the glue is there to help human beings, the software assumes you know what you're doing, and ignores stuff it doesn't understand.

Then he farted around with my screen telling me I was doing it wrong, and only made it worse, much worse (he tells the story &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/11/21.html#a8703&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and ended up saying they're going to get this right in Longhorn.

				<outline text="&quot;thinkusaalignright&quot;At the dinner in Vancouver I was one of only two or three Americans, the rest were Canadians. Of course they wanted to talk about the political situation in the US. What's to become of the Democratic party? This is much-discussed in the US too. Why worry? The diversity in the country won't go away just because the Democrats can't nominate a winner. Even within the Republican Party there's choice. Democrats could vote for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schwarzenegger.com/en/index.asp&quot;&gt;Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/poy2001/&quot;&gt;Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; (who is a citizen). Are either of these really any less repulsive than Kerry? Think about it. I'm now where I was before Kerry was the Democratic nominee. I think we do it backwards in the US. First we should decide what our issues are, then we should go shopping for representatives to represent us. See the connection? Represent. We end up voting for minor, almost irrelevant differences, and as a result, no representation, and our country can't make positive change. I don't believe the red-staters are bad or stupid. I think they're stuck in the same mess the rest of us are. " created="Sun, 21 Nov 2004 17:01:54 GMT" type="outline"/>

A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/more30&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; user from the 80s (still has the bright eyes and big smile that was the hallmark of that community, this was before the Web and blogger dinners so not too many met each other, but I met them). We ate frog legs, but most of us thought it was chicken (me too). The food was delicious. Talked a lot about OPML, directories, Manila, Frontier, podcasting, what it all means. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makeoutcity.com/Categories/About/Author/&quot;&gt;Jay McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; fans here, so far away from Lowell, I count myself among their number. At the end of the night about fifteen of the Vancouver bloggers walked me back to my hotel. Basically bloggers who come to these dinners are very nice people, we talk about their city, their country, I get tutored in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.podcatch.com/manila/gems/un/aLittleNippy.mp3&quot;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; and the currency, and hear a lot of ideas that I then incorporate into my view of things.

My own two cents. Smoking &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an aid to creativity. I don't do the intense multi-day programming jags anymore, I can't without the cigarettes. The reason why, I think, is that the drug helps you tune out distractions. The smoke keeps interruptions away. Work that requires intense concentration is aided by things that push away distractions. But at our age, Zeldman and I are roughly the same age, after thirty years of smoking, to keep doing it would be suicide, and not far-in-the-future suicide, like it is for people in their twenties and thirties, but suicide in the near future. A few people get to smoke into old age, but it seems that most don't. So quitting is a way of giving us a chance of having an old age. So we can't push the envelope like we did before. But we can help others do it. And we can applaud it when it happens. And we can tell stories to kids on our knees about the old days when we could do it ourselves. It's not so bad.

It's not like email. Let the river of items flow through your queue, scroll over them with a scroll bar, and don't let the software tell you you're falling behind. Your time is what's valuable, there's no value to the items you didn't read. If it's important it'll pop up again. &lt;i&gt;RSS is not email.&lt;/i&gt; Don't sort them out into little boxes that you have to go to, make them flow to you, in a river, unsorted.

Suppose there's an issue, say Choice vs Life (to pick something heavy) and you've got two people who like each other enough to be willing to have a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=refereed&quot;&gt;refereed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; online back and forth. So there are three people, one on each side of an issue, and the third making sure that there are no personal attacks. The discussion takes place only between the two people, for two months, two years, two decades, two lifetimes, however long it takes, however long both have something to say. (Of course people can comment on the discussion on their own blogs, on mail lists, radio shows, where ever.) A document with three authors that's constantly being revised. Sure you can take vacations, maybe a month or a year at a time, as-needed. This would be different from a mail list, or a blog, or anything else. A deliberate respectful discussion, more about the respect and exposure of issues, than about settling the unsettleable.

Have a great time at a conference for reporters and publishers, make a bunch of new friends, then fly back, again -- the flight is full, the guy sitting next to me in the middle seat has his elbow in my ribs the whole way. I pointed out that my ribs are in &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; seat, to no avail.

There are many thousands of popular RSS feeds updating every day, from technology companies like Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Sun and Oracle, big publishing companies like Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, NY Times, Newsweek, Time, BBC, Guardian, etc, exactly the kinds of enterprises that his employer serves. It's also widely used by today's opinion leaders, the bloggers. Where SGML was beached and floundering, RSS is thriving and growing.

I think we'll be lucky to get even limited metadata, and transcripts are completely out of reach. I'm not going to spend the time or money to produce them for my podcasts. And even if I could easily and economically produce a transcript, I wouldn't. Adam tried to excerpt my last podcast and found it impossible. I wasn't surprised. It was a sequence of thoughts, each building on the previous. Try to pull one out of context and it doesn't work. If I had to respond to people who had skimmed my podcast (by reading the transcript) I would stop doing it. Finally we have a medium that, unlike the Web, can't be skimmed. Reading comprehension keeps going down, people skim for keywords, not for understanding. I know because I get so much email that is based on misreading what I wrote. What a waste of intellect. For now, it's hard to do that with podcasts. Mary, my advice is to pick someone to be your guide, and let them guide. Listen to all their podcasts, get in the groove, and then reflect.

				<outline text="There's an email thread going on about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggercon.org/2004/10/19#a1692&quot;&gt;Making Money&lt;/a&gt; session. This was the second episode, in the first, Jeff Jarvis did an excellent job of leading a chorus of nickel-and-dimers. In other words, how can we turn blogs into mini-magazines, generating enough revenue to make us feel good about what we're doing. (My paraphrase, of course.) This is a hot topic. It was also at hot topic at this Con, but I played a little trick by choosing a DL who I knew would argue with this idea, a person who has written a book on it, a popular one, so there would be some disagreement in the room. When I walked in, mid-session, I could see my little plan hadn't worked, Doc was in front of the room fielding comments from people who really really want to think small. So I asked for a mike, and I argued with two or three people (who seemed to enjoy it). Anyway, now there's some irritation because it seemed we were trying to force our way of thinking on the people. Nothing could be further from the truth. However, we, Doc and I, were disagreeing with them, and that's what makes a conference interesting. And unusual. Usally there's a sameness to discourse at conferences that makes you fall asleep. So even if I agreed that putting Google ads on your blog was the best you could do, I would have looked for a way to incite some disagreement. Now if you think this is wrong, BloggerCon is not the place for you, and probably blogging is not a good thing for you either. You're going to get disagreed with, sometimes even when you're right. And that's a good thing. If you're always surrounded by people who agree with you, you never get a chance to change someone's mind, never get a chance to learn something new, to have &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; mind changed. This is also the big bennie of Election 2004, for those of us with blue-state beliefs. Heh haw, there's another way of looking at things. We may not agree, but who can argue that we're not different?" created="Tue, 09 Nov 2004 14:17:40 GMT" type="outline"/>

We've had verbal scuffles with vendors at both previous Cons. It comes with the territory. No hard feelings. Eventually most of the vendors will profit from listening to users, speaking their language, not over their heads; put them first, and we can return to something that works. This is my hope for Bloggerdom. " created="Sun, 07 Nov 2004 15:40:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One of my personal peptalks is: I make things work. I first heard this talking with John Palfrey during the buildup to the first BloggerCon, when I had some doubts whether I could pull it off. He told me it was his impression of me that I didn't fail. At first I wanted to brush what appeared to be a compliment aside, but then I thought about it, and it made me relax. All my life, when I really wanted something to work, I could make it work. I think this comes from a stubborn streak, I can visualize failure, all too well, and can't tolerate it. In the end, BC had to work because I willed it to work.

					<outline text="Everyone has a chance to speak, even if I don't agree with what they're saying, esp when I don't agree with what they're saying. Every dissenter is validation that it's an open conference, this is the reassurance we need to believe in the sincerity of every speaker. And yesterday, &lt;i&gt;we all willed it to work,&lt;/i&gt; even the people who appeared to be dissenting. They bought into the model. They stayed seated, they spoke with respect, and there was a lot of listening going on. This is what success looks like. Now let's see if we can build something on it." created="Sun, 07 Nov 2004 15:50:39 GMT"/>

Before she got to Specter, she had a stern lecture for Democrats, one I wanted to shine some light on. I agree Bush and his people are smart, very smart, but I believe there's a difference between the people who voted for Bush, and the people whose interests he serves. Do the people who voted for him understand that? That's a question, not a statement. Now another statement. I can't believe they really do, because: " created="Fri, 05 Nov 2004 15:13:57 GMT"/>

It took me about 10 minutes to fill in the ballot, with a black pen, filling in ovals. I finished first in the first group to vote, so I waited for someone else to finish and followed him out, because I wasn't familiar with this process (it was different from Calif and Mass). I fed my ballot into an electronic vote reader. That was it. My concern was that people could see how I voted. In fact I'm sure they could, and I wasn't very happy about that.

So did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt;. 4. You want to pay the music companies? It's good to pay for what you use. Go ahead and buy the songs from Apple, and then load up LimeWire and download the MP3 of the song you just paid for. Assuming they let you delete songs (I honestly don't know), delete the one you bought and replace it with the MP3. The quality may be lower, but you'll enjoy it more knowing that you can use it any way &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; like. " created="Mon, 01 Nov 2004 09:18:53 GMT" type="outline"/>
