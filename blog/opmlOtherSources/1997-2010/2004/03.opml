The Open Directory Project is going to do something with RSS, not sure what, but it's a good sign, if only just a start. Here's what I would like them to do. 1. Associate a feed with a level of the hierarchy, so someone can subscribe to a category, and anything that appeared in that category would show up in the reader's aggregator as new. 1a. Associate a feed with a level in the other direction, so that news can be routed to a category in the directory. So, to the left, you'd see the stuff that doesn't change often, and in a box to the right is the new stuff. 2. Let an author maintain a whole level of the directory with RSS. 3. What about more than one level? We thought of that too, it's called OPML. 4. After adopting RSS and OPML, implement inclusion, meaning you can point to an OPML file anywhere a node can appear and the content of that OPML is included in the directory as if it were part of the directory. 5. From there, the whole thing will be unbundled, let the search engines understand an OPML file and display the as Yahoo-like directories." created="Sun, 28 Mar 2004 03:47:57 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Another thing on my to-do list, write a how-to for aggregator developers on password-protected feeds. It came up in an interview I did with an InfoWorld reporter. I told him how Radio does it, he asked if other aggregators handle username-passwords in RSS feed URLs, and I said I don't know. What we did with Radio is use the standard way of including a username-password in a URL, and then looked for places where subscriptions are exported, and turned off exporting of those URLs. That's about all there is to it if your HTTP engine understand usernames and passwords. " created="Sun, 28 Mar 2004 03:56:13 GMT"/>

I've heard a half-dozen interviews with Clarke. He comes off as an intelligent, respectful, and not overly arrogant critic, not just of the White House policies re terrorism and Iraq, but also himself. Listening to his interview with NPR's Terry Gross, I thought -- wouldn't it be great if the White House offered up someone as thoughtful as Clarke, then we could have the kind of election some of us want, one where the issues are debated with integrity, and each of us makes an intelligent choice with our vote. No such luck, even if the White House spokespeople are intelligent (no doubt they are), they're acting like thugs and appealing to the worst in us. Shame. According to the Bush people, the only reason a man like Clarke would speak up is to sell books, to get a Democrat elected, or to get a new job. It might have all those effects and their criticism would still fail to address the key point of Clarke's testimony (under oath, btw), that the White House has diverted our resources and attention from defending against terrorism, before &lt;i&gt;and after&lt;/i&gt; 9/11. That's the amazing part.

The most recent one I did was in Radio Community Server, in 2002. Before that I did one that's still in use in Manila, it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/directory/7708/manilaAndMainresponder/membershipGroups&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of mainResponder, the underpinnings of several groupware systems built in Frontier.

The reason is so simple it's hard for some people to understand. When someone else moves, if you do it the same way you're well on your way to bootstrapping a standard, and having a standard is good.

					<outline text="The only reservation I have about Six Apart is past experience with Trackback -- they changed their mind a few times, and didn't evolve the protocol very cleanly, so it was extra hard to implement and the docs were confusingly out of synch with the practice. I'm encouraged that this time they're going slowly, presumably reviewing the protocol several times, and when it's finally released it will be something they're prepared to evolve from in a compatible (ie non-breaking) way.

It seems he did get his degree from a mail order university and it wasn't a &quot;real&quot; degree, and to the extent that he claims to be a PhD (broadly) it does appear to be a fraud. His book is still good, and I'd recommend it even if he weren't a PhD. But I do admit that back when I thought his PhD was real, somehow it seemed the book was more substantial. Should he have pressed his claim through a lawyer? No, it was a mistake, because it was dishonest to claim a PhD in the first place. Look at it this way, if he wasn't ashamed about where his PhD came from, why doesn't it say where it came from on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marsvenus.com/JohnGrayProfile.php&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt; page?

That's like saying that because someone reads a book somehow your reading a book means less. The two things have nothing to do with each other, and the fact that the opponents of gay marriage clutch at this straw shows that they don't have any valid reasons to block gays from marrying, just mystic reasons, which isn't good enough to stop people from doing something they want to do that hurts no one. Sorry control freaks, worry about your own lives, stop meddling in other people's lives. "/>

Any time wasted on this is a distraction from global warming, loose nukes, hunger, and coming up with antibiotics to replace those that are becoming obsolete. While we're at it, let's cure cancer, heart disease, diabetes. And let's help kids whose parents abuse them, and alchoholics, and how about universal health care in the US, etc etc."/>

I never did most of the things that were in the songs I admired as a kid, and it certainly freaked my parents and grandparents to hear what I was listening to, but of course, that was the point. Music for young people is a ritual that's still sacred. That we grimace and don't recognize that it's exactly like the music we loved when we were young, is validation that they're doing something new.

It's also the time that tech people seem &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; likely to make the offer. For example, Apple finally became interested in working with developers, seriously, in its darkest moments in 1996. Same with Netscape in 1999, and then the Dean campaign in early 2004. It seems to be human nature to wait until it's too late, when the battle is lost, as a desperate last measure. But working together is a great way to cement victory.

					<outline text="Now that RSS is ascending so powerfully, I want to make an offer on its behalf. It would be easy to say that other formats don't matter, but even if I believe that, the community is better off if we have one format we're all promoting; as opposed to having continued arguments about whether &quot;issued&quot; is better than &quot;pubDate&quot;.

Google is powerful, but they're not so powerful that they can compete with the ever increasing mountain of support for RSS. And why should they pick a fight with RSS? It's a format. It's not stealing any revenue from them. None of their jobs depend on wiping out RSS. It makes no sense to fight with it.

I invited Clay himself to lead the session but unfortunately he can't. I believe that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a power law in weblogs, but is that bad news? Can you conclude that every medium is like every one that came before? History certainly doesn't support that. Consider the post just above this. I don't have strong feelings about Spalding Grey, beyond the normal sympathy and curiosity that a reasonably normal adult would have for a dead person who probably suffered, at least at the end of his life. But I know that some of the people who read this weblog have a deeper connection to Grey's life and work. So when I heard the news, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=spalding+grey&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn&quot;&gt;realized&lt;/a&gt; that it was quite new, it was virtually automatic for me to point to it. I know that I'm one of the A-list guys. I work at being that. It's been a goal for me because I want ideas that I think are important to be heard. Is that a bad thing? Of course I don't think so.

One thing stood out, if they believed in the Internet why didn't they use the Web to pump out the video that CNN wasn't showing? What I saw briefly, ironically on CNN, was very compelling. Didn't they get that they had another channel to communicate with voters. Word of mouth might have carried their point of view. At least they could have tried. If they trusted voters they would have ignored what the press and the other candidates and continued to go direct. It's also clear they peaked too soon. He won. But then, what did he win? With a year to go before the election, in late 2003, he won the right to be the guy everyone else targeted. It's the same problem Kerry has now. Too much time with nothing to do but lose.

I talked with my parents about this last weekend when I was visiting NY. We were watching a movie, with commercials, if you can believe that. I kept telling them they were the only ones watching the commercials, everyone else was fast-forwarding over them (I know it's not true, but I was hyping). I said it many many times (basically every time I had to endure the insipid commercials). Like Marc, I couldn't understand why they don't get a TiVO. I offered to install it. But I don't think they understood what it does, or why they would want it. The idea is foreign. I can't get my dad to use an RSS aggregator even though he's a news junkie. No one there is scared of technology, which is Scoble's theory. It's something else. They don't see why they need it. It's funny, I've been having these talks with my parents for 25 years. First it was &quot;Get an Apple II.&quot; My Dad, the ex-IBMer said he'd wait for IBM's. He eventually got an Apple II anyway. Then of course he got an IBM. Then Macs, laser printers, AOL, email, the Web, etc. Every time the same thing. They don't see why they need it. Then three years later they're evangelizing the tech they didn't think they needed. My mother, a psychologist, refused to accept interns who didn't use a word processor (in the mid-80s). She would arrogantly say &quot;They're too stupid to work for me.&quot; There is an adoption curve. TiVO hasn't reached the masses yet. It surely will.

Initially in 1999, there were two ways to use RSS, Netscape's and ours, and the two were quite different, but both were aggregators. It's true that the word syndication originally comes form the idea of including the content of a syndicated news source in another publication. But that really has fallen off. That's the &quot;dark side&quot; of syndication, as explained in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1999/09/03/theDarkSideOfSyndication&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; from 1999. People make fun of Jakob Nielsen, but he's really a very smart guy. He figured out the dark-side-light-side thing.

It tells the story of Trent Lott, his talk at Strom Thurmond's birthday party, and how the news flowed through professional channels, to the blogosphere, and back, ultimately resulting in Lott's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,863964,00.html&quot;&gt;resignation&lt;/a&gt; as majority leader of the US Senate.

A personal note, it's gratifying to see the study is available publicly, this makes it available for review by bloggers, as well as being useful in classrooms, and as a reference to scholars who will study weblogs in the future.

My uncle loved all the Internet arcania I showed him, like the Dancing Hamsters. He said he had no context to understand what they were. But that's why he found them fascinating.

				<outline text="It's getting to be time to figure out what I'm going to do when I grow up. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/fellows&quot;&gt;fellowship&lt;/a&gt; lasts through June, and then it's on to new things. I don't even know where I'm going to live. Most of my posessions are in storage in the Bay Area. I have a nice car, and except for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1051806233931&amp;skuId=4744922&amp;type=product&quot;&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; everything I'm carrying fits in it.

It's not a word I throw around casually. I think of friendship the way tennis players think of a game. I hit the ball over the net. My friend hits it back (the best he can). I hit it back (same thing). Now in some cases, the other guy deliberately hits the ball into the net. That's not much fun. Then there's the guy who you hit the ball to, he catches it, and runs off the court with it. And then there's the guy (the anti-friend, or enemy) who puts a stick of dynamite in the ball, then hits it back so it can explode when it hits my racket. I hate when that happens! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 01 Mar 2004 17:17:06 GMT"/>
