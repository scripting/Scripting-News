				<outline text="&quot;thinkusaalignright&quot;Last night's 60 Minutes had a controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/25/60minutes/rooney/main619533.shtml&quot;&gt;segment&lt;/a&gt;, I watched it this morning on TiVO, a 10-minute scroll of pictures of American soldiers who died in Iraq. Some observations. When people say it's just Americans in Iraq they're missing something, America is so diverse, we have people of European, African, Asian, Latin descent. All those young people's lives gone, it's profoundly sad, and you feel it differently when you see all their faces scrolling by. In Andy Rooney's lead-up he got in a dig at men, saying most of the people working on new ways to kill people are men. He didn't mention that most of the soldiers who die in wars are men too. Next week I'd like to see CBS run a similar segment with all the Iraqis who have died in the war. Their deaths are no less tragic. I suspect you'd see a lot of small children, mothers and grandparents among their dead. It would take much longer than sixty minutes. " created="Mon, 31 May 2004 16:00:52 GMT" type="outline"/>

So much for the theory that I like everything. This one just goes on and on. At one point the camera focuses on an old man who at first looks like he might be Peter O'Toole. Oh good, we'll have some real &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netflix.com/RoleDisplay?id=69540&quot;&gt;acting&lt;/a&gt; now, I said to myself. But on closer examination, it's just a sad old man, not O'Toole. And the acting continues to be absolutely terrible. The best moments are when Brad Pitt preens, looking beautiful. And that's pretty bad. Anyway on getting home I looked up some &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;id=1808444810&amp;cf=critic&amp;intl=us&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;, and hold on, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Peter O'Toole.

				<outline text="I'm getting a sense that some of the newer aggregators have a funny way of handling time. Not sure exactly what's going on. I've gotten one complaint about the NY Times feeds which include the items in the order the NY Times provides them. It's never been a problem in Radio's aggregator, it knows if it has seen an item before and if it has, it doesn't present it to the user. I gather some reading software isn't keeping track of what they've already shown the user. This is not a bug in the feeds as some people believe, rather a missing feature in the aggregator. However, I haven't got enough data to be sure, I'm just guessing. We've talked about starting to track features in aggregators and blogging tools at the Berkman Thursday meetings.

They were a friendly company, nice guys. I'd meet with them from time to time to talk about how apps would work when they could be connected by a scripting system.

I called Paolo from a train in Germany earlier this month and we talked about the release.  I can't speak for Paolo of course, but my wish is for humble expectations, a very long-term perspective, a no-rush attitude. We've learned from previous incarnations of the Frontier community, when expectations are too great, when we're too much of a rush, then feelings rule, not intelligence. Paolo and his partners have bet their future on this in the past, with very mixed results.

This probably will cause &lt;a href=&quot;http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Fork%20(Open%20Source)&quot;&gt;forks&lt;/a&gt; to happen right way, thereby removing the power of threats to fork. Go ahead and fork, the sooner the better. Perhaps we'll even manage an OPML directory of each of the forks, and see what their selling propositions will be. Maybe one will do a great job of supporting the Mac platform. Maybe one will integrate with Mozilla. Maybe the OSF will adopt one, maybe Apache, maybe Microsoft or Sun or Google, MIT or Harvard. I've thought of trying to force interop through the license, but I'm not sure if that would work. I'd like to have my apps run in any Frontier-derived environment. The system.environment &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$6753&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; can help code configure itself. I guess what I'm saying is that it's important that we work together, but it's also important to recognize that if the power to fork is there, then forks will certainly happen. This is similar to my philosophy of format design. I assume we'll come up with the worst-possible names for elements, and then factor that into my plans." created="Thu, 20 May 2004 12:43:09 GMT" type="outline"/>

My concern was when will UserLand get around to enhancing and improving the &quot;kernel&quot; -- the large base of C code that runs Manila and Radio -- the scripting language, object database, verb set, server, multi-threaded runtime, content management framework. It's been several years since there was a meaningful update of that code. " created="Mon, 17 May 2004 09:33:38 GMT"/>

For example, Movable Type is written in Perl. WordPress is PHP. Blogger is Java. UserLand's products are different because they build on a private platform. For a long time we saw this as an advantage, the UserLand runtime is very rich and powerful, and offered performance benefits. When a new layer came on, for example the CMS, when it got stable and mature, we'd &quot;kernelize&quot; it, so it would be super-fast. But experience in the market said that, to succeed, UserLand didn't need to own its kernel. In fact, that it was the only developer using this kernel may well have been a &lt;i&gt;liability&lt;/i&gt; for UserLand. " created="Mon, 17 May 2004 09:32:09 GMT"/>

In 1987 we sold Living Videotext to Symantec, and along with it, sold them our products, ThinkTank, Ready and MORE. I appreciate what Symantec did for us, I'm still living off the money I made in the public stock offering, but the products died inside Symantec. I'm not blaming them for that, because it's very likely they would have died inside Living Videotext had we not been acquired. But some good products disappeared. To this day people ask me what became of MORE, and tell me how advanced it was, and how nothing has replaced it. It's a sad story, and a shame, that the art of outlining took such a hit. I swore this would never happen again. There are a lot of good ideas in that base of software that you won't find elsewhere.

But I am on the board of directors of the company, and I persuaded my fellow board members that it would be in the company's interest to let the kernel develop separately from the products that build on it. And that's what I want to announce today. At some point in the next few months, there will be an open source release of the Frontier kernel. Not sure what license it'll use. There won't be any grand expectations of what kind of community will develop. Even if no bugs get fixed, if no features get added, if no new OSes are supported, it will be worth it, because its future will be assured.

					<outline text="1. Google announced that they were doing mail lists in competition with Yahoo. I'm sure the service will be good, but it comes with a gotcha. No RSS, only Atom. So Google continues to try to force the issue. Everyone I've talked with can't figure it out, why do they care? And people are starting to get angry about it. I find my own anger receding. I'm starting to accept Atom on Google's terms. But I remember that it's a bad turn. It will lead to more fragmentation, not less, and it will be harder and harder for independent developers to play in the aggregator space. I've been pushing for coalescing, not splitting apart. The big companies, if they act like their arrogant selves, will push the other way. One wonders if for once, the users will see that their interests are aligned with the indies. " created="Fri, 14 May 2004 10:11:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Six Apart announced new pricing for Movable Type and hell breaks loose. The users are acting as children, saying somehow they didn't know that eventually Six Apart would charge for their software. I knew they were going to charge, why didn't you? I can say this because I'm not a customer (I do use their software, but I didn't pay for it) and I'm not them. But I've been where they are and it sucks. No one's perfect. If you use their software, you owe them some money. If you don't like the price, don't use it. Amazingly they're not asking for money if you use the new software in a limited form, or continue to use the old software. Users who can't get behind that are people we don't need to work with. Everything costs money. When you drive to the gas station, try whining at the attendant, and see how much gas you get. Do it enough and they'll call the cops." created="Fri, 14 May 2004 10:14:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. This isn't really big news but what the heck. I got a very nice greeting yesterday from Lessig, who, while speaking was surprised to see me in the last row typing away into my blog. He said Dave! Are you blogging this? I said of course I am. And then he proceded to fall down. I said Larry don't hurt yourself. It was memorable. Lessig is a good guy. I gotta talk with him about what's going on with Movable Type. How can we help reset users' expectations so they understand that if they want good software, it might cost money? I wonder if Larry agrees." created="Fri, 14 May 2004 10:19:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. The W3C said they wanted Atom. On the way to lunch I said to one of my colleagues that might be good news. Then I looked over and said I'm being cynical. She knew. The W3C has been the roachtrap of standards. Ideas go in and don't come out. I turned over one of my creations to the W3C, and it died there, a long painful death, where it turned into a political football for dozens of tech companies. It might be better today because the tech world has shrunk, but hell, we don't need the tech companies, or the W3C. The former are bad actors, the latter is their consortium. The syndication world is growing fast, but not thriving. Our challenges are economic, not technologic. I'd be more impressed if MasterCard got excited about RSS than the W3C getting excited about Atom. Scoble nailed it. Like all other domains, the standards bodies compete with other standards bodies. The IETF is interested, so of course the W3C is. " created="Fri, 14 May 2004 10:20:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. Rogers leaked that he's on the newly configured RSS Advisory Board. I didn't want to announce this right away, but it kind of got lost in all the other stuff. Count my blessings. Anyway, the other new members are Andrew Grumet, Adam Curry, and of course myself. Yesterday, we made an offer to one other person who hasn't responded yet.

He had emailed me an invite to use Gmail in the first wave of invites, but my very crude spam system coughed it up, and then hurled his follow-up email. Once I knew it was there and got back from Europe I tried to use it, only to find out that the invite had expired.

Those guys should get busy with blogging, if they're not already working on a blogging interface. And don't be surprised when Google announces a centralized aggregator a la Bloglines (hopefully not with a three-pane interface). That will be Microsoft's cue to &lt;s&gt;release&lt;/s&gt; announce theirs, and we're off to the races. (I bet Sun buys Bloglines.) That's why it's so incredibly important that the format coalesce now before it becomes a basis for competition, like the browser wars of the 1990s. That's why I'm beggin. (Of course, with the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/directory/5/feeds&quot;&gt;running start&lt;/a&gt; RSS has, this could be the final act for the Tech industry.

He puts himself on our side, saying that the behavior of the military doesn't represent American values. He's hardly an authority on that, he's a public servant who is failing to serve the public. They're still trying to serve the Iraqi people, but their jobs require that they serve the &lt;i&gt;American&lt;/i&gt; people.

The next release of Microsoft's OneNote will import OPML outlines. Very good. Of course it should export them too. The old Microsoft would never have done this, in fact there's an old Microsoft guy running around the syndication community, he's &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0743212355.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the biggest advocates of reinventing everything just for the sake of revinvention. It takes a lot for a big company like Microsoft to adopt a format developed outside, esp one not developed at another BigCo. Thanks for setting a great example. Google, please pay attention to this. You lose nothing by keeping the number of formats small, by building on other people's work instead of undermining it, by not being evil. You already knew that, at the top, but perhaps some of the new guys don't understand what it means. It's in the company prospectus. So I hope you won't mind if we hold you to a higher standard. I assume that's why it's there. " created="Mon, 03 May 2004 15:19:27 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="This NY Times article is a milestone; it describes the basic difference between the economy of publishing versus the economy of eyeballs. On the Internet, over time, the role of &quot;audience&quot; goes away, being replaced by a network of people with information that other people use, and products people want, that other people can buy. On the eBay of tomorrow, the vendor of the product you buy may never have even seen the product, maybe never have seen a prototype, all they knew as that a need wasn't being met, and they took a chance on the idea. Manufacturing will be done where it's most efficient. Things that used to require experts, like advertising, travel agencies, realtors, will decline. " created="Sat, 01 May 2004 07:14:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One of the cool things about the Google prospectus, which I've only read second-hand, is that they stick by the principles of the Web, which say you give up control and provide a service people want. But I wonder if they've grown so big that Sergey and Larry don't know what their company is doing. If that hasn't happened yet, it will happen soon, IPO or not. As good as Google is, as much as they are &lt;i&gt;Of The Internet,&lt;/i&gt; as they grow, they aggregate functionality that's probably better off being distributed. It'll become tempting if it hasn't already to make money at the expense of the commons. Already Google is acting like big chunks of the commons are private property.
