I knew it would be trouble because I immediately wanted to do my own audio show in response. What was even weirder is that Adam included a clip of The Gillmor Gang, which I had also been avoiding, because I want to get away from all that michegas for a bit, but no such luck. I'm already back in the thick of it. I'll probably do an audio blog post before the night is out.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010745.shtml&quot;&gt;I missed the debate&lt;/a&gt; about the accuracy of Wikipedia, but let me get my two cents in anyway. The librarian was right to raise the question. However, I find that on some subjects that I have expertise on, it does a remarkably good job, better than most professional journalists. But on other subjects, it only represents one point of view. When others try to balance it, their notes are deleted. This is the inherent weakness in the Wiki model, the consensus isn't always correct, esp when some people want to have their point of view prevail above all others.

				<outline text="Remind me to tell you about the bizarre ways hotels make you connect to the Internet. There are only two correct ways to do it. 1. Support WiFi (easiest by far). 2. Have an Ethernet jack on the wall behind the desk. For a bonus point, include a cable. The room I'm in tonight actually has a PC in it, as if anyone who cares about the Internet travels without a laptop. I had to get a support person to come up and reconfigure it so I could connect with my laptop. I asked how often she has to do this. Basically for every customer, she said. Why not give in and just let us plug directly in. She was absolutely sure there was some magic reason the hotel wanted you to use their computer. I told her I was sure the computer would be gone in no more than a year. She looked at me like I was a clueless old coot (which of course I am).

					<outline text="1. No breakage. I want old scripts continue to run in new environments.

Smallish towns like Ashland are great. Walk 20 minutes down Main St, make a right on First, walk 10 minutes, make a right on 8th Avenue, and zig-zag back to the car exactly an hour later. And you get to see all the neighborhoods (hopefully they're nice, but you can drive around first to make sure they are). Second tip. University campuses are perfect for walks. They're usually pretty well-kept, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.und.edu/walk/&quot;&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; for walking. The interesting thing about the university here in Grand Forks is that they have this network of interior walkways, just like Duluth. It gets so cold here that it's not practical to walk outside to get from building to building.

I didn't end up making it as far as International Falls today, and I didn't take US 51 all the way north. I cut west on state roads, and then headed north, then west. Anyway, this blog post is about why Internet access while traveling is going to be free, soon. And I explain how weblogs will make money, far more money than you can make through an advertising model. As the Silicon Valley money people get interested in weblogs and making money, this is becoming again an hot topic. It's not about replicating models from the print and TV world. I lay it out pretty clearly. Designed for people who manage big multinational businesses. Nothing really technical here. " created="Sun, 29 Aug 2004 23:19:33 GMT" type="outline"/>

A place I walked to and drove to hundreds of times. Totally missed it. I also remembered Madison being dirtier and poorer than it is. Memories of opinions. Perhaps my point of view then was more priviledged somehow, or my tolerance for grunge has gone up. Anyway some of my memories of this place were sweet and are not going away. I remember loving my work like I never have since. And I remember walking home late at night in sub-zero temperatures, full of enthusiasm for life, to a bed already warmed by a 19-year old girl I was in love with. It was a sweet life, but one filled with puzzles. I lived two blocks from the minor league baseball stadium. Why didn't I ever go to a game? (I think their name was the Muskies.) State St is still there, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pics.scripting.com/0032/0008.jpg&quot;&gt;Parthenon&lt;/a&gt; is too.

So you're looking at a very large part of the flow from the eastern half of North America, east of the Continental Divide. But the town is dead, or so it seems, but here's what's really weird, someone spent a lot of money trying to get it to come back to life, but it didn't work. They have a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; empty hotel and convention center. A huge and empty farmer's market. Some really nice looking empty restaurants. Shops and boutiques, well-stocked, open, empty. Lots of for sale signs. A Republican headquarters. An eerie feeling. And it was hugely hot and humid. While I was there the sky opened up, I took shelter, then it was over and five minutes later the sidewalks were dry, that's how hot it was. " created="Wed, 25 Aug 2004 23:32:57 GMT" type="outline"/>

It's because of Google that our sites are littered with links to these offensive sites that have &lt;i&gt;nothing to do&lt;/i&gt; with ours. If they're smart enough to come up with tricks like Google News and Local Google, why can't their search engine recognize comment and referer spam and not use it in determining page rank?

Everyone is invited and the cost is $0. So it's the antithesis of the classic Silicon Valley conference, whose goal is to be exclusive, where participation, even as a member of the audience, is a priviledge conferred on the few. No disrespect to that model of conferences, because I supported them myself, and helped Stewart Alsop with Agenda and Demo. Stewart is an expert craftsman of exclusivity, and it worked well in the eighties and early nineties. But with the turn to blogs there's a new kind of filter in place, courage. Do you have the guts to put your ideas out there, to be tested in a public forum, without a brand or masthead over your name to cushion the fall if you get it wrong or say something that offends a powerful person? And do you have the guts to come to a conference where there is no pecking order, where your ideas might actually be heard and acted on? There's safety in being powerless, but would you like to try being power&lt;i&gt;ful&lt;/i&gt; instead? That's the challenge of BloggerCon. The members of exclusive clubs are welcome, but first-come-first-serve. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" category="/Special events/BloggerCon" created="Mon, 16 Aug 2004 11:16:29 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Note the striked-through &quot;attended&quot; in the pargraph above. It's so hard to change the way we think about conferences. For non-blogging conferences, &quot;attended&quot; is the right word for most people. You play a passive role, except in the hallways, which is why so many people spend so much time in the hallways. In blogs, we assume that the people reading your blog at least &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; have their own blogs; just like at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggercon.org/2004/04/21#a1310&quot;&gt;unconference&lt;/a&gt;, anyone could speak if they wanted to. As someone who wants to speak at every conference, whether I'm permitted to or not, it would be virtually impossible for me to launch a conference without changing the rules so that it's acceptable for everyone to speak at all times. But old habits die hard, and the language of the old style of conferences creeps back. But you're not attending, you're not part of the audience.

I thought of another. Bloggers generally have archives, so you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/dir/davesWorld/onThisDayIn&quot;&gt;see what&lt;/a&gt; they said a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2003/08/13&quot;&gt;year&lt;/a&gt; ago, two &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2002/08/13&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; ago and so forth. Newspapers and magazines, even on the Web, generally don't make their archive availalbe, and when they do, it's almost always for a prohibitive per-article fee. So when the NY Times or Washington Post acknowledge that their reporting of the Iraq War was flawed, they have access to the archive that we don't. What other stories turned out to be wrong? How frequently do they look back and examine? What coverage assumed facts not in evidence? We don't know. This makes them less trustworthy, and gives them less incentive to even &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; to cover the news fairly. Most bloggers know, because the archive is permanent, that their writings will be examined with the benefit of hindsight." created="Fri, 13 Aug 2004 15:05:36 GMT" type="outline"/>

Dan Farber, an old friend from PC and Mac days was there too (he works at CNET now). We talked about blogs, I tried to communicate that some people (like myself) take weblogs seriously. If we didn't do a good job, we want to know. But if we did a good job, and people say we didn't, we're like everyone else who takes pride in their work. We don't like being ridiculed, made fun of, or minimized. I told Charles I remembered when the mainframe computer guys sniffed at our &quot;micro&quot; computers. They said our little computers would never match the power of their big ones. It didn't turn out that way. We don't talk about Control Data, Univac, or even DEC anymore, except in a historic sense.

Everything computers touch gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/disintermediation.html&quot;&gt;disintermediated&lt;/a&gt;. The expertise of connections is something that is easily replaced by computers. Human insight, intelligence, innovation, those are things &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; do. But with the aid of ever more powerful and inexpensive tools, we can do more with less. So it seems the role of bloggers must expand over time, if it didn't that would be to deny &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/Moores_Law.html&quot;&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt;. Sure not every blogger is a visionary and willing to work hard to have the honor of being first. But as I told Charles, decisions are made by those who show up. It didn't take that many people to start the personal computer revolution, and even if just a few bloggers do excellent work, the die will be cast, the precedent set, the future clear.

What will we try to figure out at this conference? I like to frame each conference that way. Even if we don't answer the question, we at least have a framework for discussion. After much back and forth, here's what we came up with: What are the different kinds of blogging? By asking this question, we actually make a statement -- that there is more than one kind of blogging. A student's blog is likely to be different from a preacher's. How? A reporter's blog different from a librarian's or a historian's. Never mind listing &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the different kinds, what are some of them?

We had a great time. She's got a huge heart and a very sweet disposition, made all the nicer because she brought that out in me. Do you doubt there was magic present that night? Listen. It's there.

The President lied about the connection between al Qaeda and Iraq in order to get us to go along with his war, there was no connection, it was obvious then, and totally obvious now. So if he lied to get us to pay billions to fight a war we didn't need to (if our goal was to fight terrorism, which we are told it is) well, why wouldn't he lie now? This is something the President should address, if he wants people to vote for him. At some point I hope even smart Republicans would want some kind of explanation about that. And Bush should also explain &lt;b&gt;why al Qaeda is still in business, almost three years after the 9-11 disaster.&lt;/b&gt; How effectively has he used our military, our money, our time, our lives, to make the country safer.

This is a perma-thread, it's like the one about whether or not scripters are programmers. I've always argued that they are. If you write logic, loops, assignments; if you worry about saving stuff to disk and user interfaces, why should it matter what language you work in? Same thing with journalism. I explained to a journalist, who interviewed me before going to Boston, that I planned to go there, experience things, see things, use all my senses, and apply all my experience, and then write about the parts that I felt should be written about. He said that's half of what he does, the other half being &quot;big stories.&quot; I argued that there's nothing bigger than writing about what you experience. Maybe this is the distinction between a blogger and a journo. We accept our limits, they're still struggling with theirs. But I don't accept David's belief that journalism is having an office and an editor and being given assignments. I think there's more to journalism, and less. And in the end it's not such a big thing to say you're a journalist, and yes, the pros have to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/07/30/lastGasp.gif&quot;&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt;, not because we're out to get them, but because we stopped waiting for them." created="Sun, 01 Aug 2004 13:27:40 GMT" type="outline"/>

(I had already said I planned to vote for Kerry.) I said his only job, right now, is to get elected, and I can understand why he personally doesn't want to engage at that level. Also, we can do other things to help increase the chance that Bush is not re-elected, especially in a battleground state like Pennsylvania. Even if you can't convince a Republican to switch to vote for Kerry, you can talk with all your Democrat-voting friends and make sure they know why they should vote on Election Day. Every Kerry voter who stays home is an effective vote for Bush. The Democrats like to talk about the grass roots, but where are our marching orders? Suppose I live in a state that &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; a battleground state? What can I do to increase the likelihood of a Kerry win?
