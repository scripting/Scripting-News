				<outline text="&quot;thinkusaalignright&quot;Richard Carter via email: &quot;I think you should stop sitting on the fence and tell us which candidate Scripting News endorses.&quot; Good idea. Scripting News endorses John Kerry for President. To be fair, Richard put a smiley at the end of his request. But I thought it was a good chance to get in another plug for Kerry. I'm reading Seymour Hersh's &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=vW1ntax9tS&amp;isbn=0060195916&amp;itm=1&quot;&gt;Chain of Command&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think most people know that Bush has thrown out the Geneva Convention for dealing with prisoners of war. We think of ourselves as the good guys, but we're not the good guys now, if we ever were. Bush may make you feel good, but it's not real. And there's a practical side to it. Next time our troops are held prisoner, it would be a stretch to expect they would be treated humanely according to the Geneva Convention. That's one of the reasons we support it, it's a way of protecting &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; soliders from torture. Also last night on MSNBC, finally saw a recount of the faceoff between Kerry and Nixon in the early 70s. Kerry was proven right. The Calley massacre was uncovered while the controversy was going on, as were the Pentagon Papers. This should have been covered when the Swift Boat ads were running. An amazing lapse in journalism.

The last big project for me to complete is the Food For Thought dinners at 8PM on Saturday night (November 6). We'll have eight tables of 15-20 people each, each led by a discussion leader, much like the daily sessions, but you get to eat too. Sylvia Paull and Enoch Choi chose the restaurants, all are adjacent to the Stanford campus and all are reasonably priced. If more than 150 people want to participate we can reserve more tables.

I started doing regular podcasts myself in &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/11#When:9:13:45AM&quot;&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/12#When:10:56:11AM&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/17#When:1:45:43PM&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; year.

Part of me doesn't care, but some of the stories that are coming out are incredibly mean. That I mind, a lot. (Sorry, I'm not going to point to them.) There have always been a lot of hitchhikers, even hijackers, as a format or protocol or activity becomes popular, but Adam isn't one of those people.

The iPodder software was the first software to handle enclosures specially for iPods, but Radio UserLand had support for time-shifted enclosures in its first release in January 2002. So to say that iPodder was the first software to enable podcasting, would be taking a fairly narrow view of what podcasting is. Even though Adam gives me credit for the RSS work I did, he didn't actually give me credit for the software, or for the podcasts we did at Harvard in 2003, and my own personal podcast stream starting this summer.

A rising deficit is a rising tax. At some point, unless he's planning on going bankrupt, we're going to have to pay back all the money we're pouring into Iraq. And unlike spending on education, health care, or infrastructure, there's no resulting growth to fund the payback. The money for Iraq is coming out of our pockets, one way or the other, sooner or later. I have a feeling it's not going to come in the form of higher taxes for his patrons. And when they say deficits will be paid for by our children and grandchildren, that's wishful thinking.

Given the huge problems caused by Bush, wouldn't it be something if he had proposals that had a chance of making sure those problems don't plague a Kerry Administration. Some form of extra accountability if he should break a major commitment, as Bush did about going to war in Iraq. (I agree with Kerry, I remember the spin at the time the Senate voted to authorize the war, the President was clear that this was just an option, not a plan.)

Since I'm voting for Kerry, I can balance his promise, by saying if Kerry is elected, I plan to get on his case and stay on it all through his term. We've had enough horrible government. We must be suspicious of these guys, no matter what party they're from. Now, to be perfectly straight, I don't think I could support a re-elected George Bush. I stood behind him after we were attacked, this is the American thing to do, it's one of the reasons our country is so great. But enough already. We're so divided because of Bush that people are actually talking openly about &lt;i&gt;civil war&lt;/i&gt; after the election. This is no good.

I've read their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/tos&quot;&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, have you? It seems to say they can discontinue serving your feed at any time, without notice. No guarantee that you can opt out without losing all your subscribers. This is what's wrong with building a network around a centralized node. What are you getting in return? Statistics. That's cool.

It's hard to believe I was so &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/10/14#When:7:55:52AM&quot;&gt;excited&lt;/a&gt; just a couple of weeks ago, fully expecting there was a goldmine of data to be found on my local hard disk, only to find that most of the stuff Google could find was either spam or virus email. I don't use Office, I'm religious about that, I won't use any non-Internet Microsoft product until they start investing again in MSIE. I don't hold out much hope, but it's the least I can do for the Web. Seems Google is just as fixated on Microsoft as Microsoft is, because not only don't they index Radio's object database, they don't even provide a way for me to write a driver to help them index it. Since most of my content is in that format, that's probably what's holding me back from getting any real value from GDS. " created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 12:35:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But Google, don't rush, because I've already learned, long ago, if I want to be able to search something I just need to publish it, and eventually it'll show up in Google. I just have to be willing to share it with the world. In a way this is a Lessig-like scheme to get me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; my content so it can be part of his cool new website. But of course the website we all want to be part of is... Google (not the one on my desktop by the way). So basically search is just where it needs to be, after all. We didn't really need it on our desktop where it potentially &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000264.html&quot;&gt;exposes&lt;/a&gt; all our passwords and secret desires, which of course we &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want exposed.

I called him on it. Then I observed that I do that sometimes myself. He laughed, he knew what I was talking about. There's a certain book publisher in Sebastapol that you're not supposed to criticize. I've done that too many times, and as a result am not invited to participate in their confabs. They've used this tactic to go into areas I care very much about, sometimes even claiming that open work comes out of these exclusive events. " created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 13:06:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now there's no good reason for me to accept a conflict of interest here, it's not like they're offering me a life-saving medical treatment in return for my silence, and even if they were, I would be required to disclaim that. So, no more of that. If you go to their conferences, and don't mind that they're closed events, only O'Reilly friends welcome, well, then you and I belong to different Webs, that's about all there is to say about it. But if they excluded you, I'd stand up for you, by not going, and saying clearly why I wasn't. Too many people who think of me as a friend look the other way. That hasn't been cool for quite some time, now it's not cool publicly either. I'll sleep better knowing I've leveled with you all, and I really don't care if O'Reilly, Dougherty and Dornfest don't like it.

					<outline text="He sent me an email, reminding me that I had ordered a copy of Streets &amp; Trips with GPS for my new Sony laptop (which runs Windows XP). Okay, like you, like Scoble, I'm full of shit, but at least I'm honest, so I'll return it as soon as it arrives. He's right, I can't support Microsoft and as much as I'd like to have the new toy, it'll be better for the Web if I don't have it." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 13:28:49 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Which leads me to the next, probably most important, point. One of Scoble's bosses, Vic Gundotra, once asked me why I'm so harshly critical of Microsoft but generally stay away from criticizing (his example) Apple. I gave him an honest answer, but a coward's answer. It's because there's no support for being critical of Apple, and there's all kinds of support for being critical of Microsoft.

					<outline text="Well, this is about as dishonest as you can get, and &lt;i&gt;we've got to stop this&lt;/i&gt; if we have any hope of creating a useful medium here. The medium we've set up is far too easy to control through intimidation. If we ever tread outside of the safe territory of trashing Microsoft, we lose all support, at a time when we need much more support." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 13:33:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And Scoble can do his part to help his employer. When I read his glowing reports from O'Reilly events, it's really hard to think of him as a friend. Sylvia Paull, who's helping with BloggerCon, and has been a friend for 20 years, once said this: &quot;I don't go to parties my friends aren't welcome at.&quot; This is a good principle, and as good a definition of the spirit of the Web as I've ever heard.

Doc Searls is both a proponent of the Cluetrain, and a big looker-in-the-other-direction. At BloggerCon, one of the things I'd like to talk about is meaning what we say and examining our own bullshit. If someone says &quot;Look I found a bug in your software,&quot; is that good news or bad? The Cluetrain says it's good news. So does programming culture. So does Microsoft's old culture (one which almost doesn't exist anymore). We have a few among us who don't want to be talked about, yet want to dominate the conversation.

					<outline text="A couple of weeks ago, Martin Nisenholtz at the NY Times asked me and a few other bloggers to look at the case of Judith Miller, a reporter at the Times, a famous one, who may go to jail to protect a source. He asked me to read an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/opinion/10sulzberger.html?ex=1255147200&amp;en=c82491fff1e47a87&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, written by the publisher of the paper, and say what I think.

					<outline text="Last night on the CNN program NewsNight, Aaron Brown, the host, interviewed Miller in a very long segment. I didn't time it, but I think it was probably ten minutes.

					<outline text="I've been watching a lot of CNN and MSNBC lately, with the election so close, and this presentation was striking in its calmness, and thoughtfulness. Two intelligent people, talking about an important issue with big implications, with plenty of time, talking slowly, explaining themselves carefully. There was something disturbing about it, they weren't shouting. There was no opposition. No one was disagreeing with her. How unlike CNN. How wrong of CNN. How wrong of the the Times to support this." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 14:05:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On examination, where does the Times derive its right to deny the court order? Does the Times feel that I, an ordinary citizen, would have to comply with such an order? If I would, then what's the legal difference between a Times reporter and a blogger? Does that mean that Times reporters would have to be licensed by the state? Does the Times really support this idea? I hope not. " created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 14:07:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Fact is, sometimes the public need for information trumps a writer's guarantee of privacy to sources. Why should Miller be able to offer anonymity if a blogger can't? The Constitution does not give special status or protection to reporters. The First Amendment applies to all, not just people with a press badge. They were right to bring this to the blogosphere, but they were wrong in assuming we wouldn't probe and ask the questions they likely don't have answers for. They should join this discussion. They haven't so far." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2004 14:08:46 GMT"/>

For so many reasons. First, he's the most skillful political speaker we have, in either party. Watching him at work is like watching a skilled artist, when we've had to tolerate such second-stringers, in Bush and Cheney and yes, Kerry and Edwards. Second, it's great to see him look so well! I have some idea what he's been through. This particular disease and its treatment help deepen people and bring on a sense of purpose and impatience. Let's get it done, now. Third, he will help the cause and raise the level of the debate. It's good to see him standing up for and behind John Kerry. In the early days of the Edwards partnership, Kerry was awkward, but you can see how he has grown as a leader. And Clinton's frailty, his vulnerability, works. Kerry, who actually is older than Clinton, can be seen as relying on and at the same time supporting the weaker but more experienced man. I like it because &lt;i&gt;it works. &lt;/i&gt;Finally, so many years after Clinton's scandal, it's time to forgive the man. Enough time has passed, he's suffered enough, he's good enough. As they say, when Clinton lied no one died. Those were simpler times.

And his directory would reflect any hierarchy in the Microsoft OPML document (it doesn't have any now). Finally, I can comment on other people's use of OPML, and show how it can be used to create a distributed directory with multiple authors and no bottlenecks.

This is great because there are so many ways the weblog community and Google can cooperate to make the World Wide Web work better, and help people get the information they're looking for, faster and faster. Bloggers create the knowledge on the Web, and Google helps us find it. We've had our differences, mostly about technical issues, and for now, we still do -- but when it comes to learning about and supporting the blogosphere, we're on the &lt;i&gt;same side.&lt;/i&gt; So it's with great pleasure that I thank Google for their financial support of BloggerCon, and look forward to their participation in the event." created="Thu, 21 Oct 2004 16:40:18 GMT" type="outline"/>

Today in Boston, even a small child in kindergarten has lived long enough to see the Boston Red Sox defeat the mighty Yankees, something I never thought I'd be able to write, not in this lifetime. And who could not see the miracle in last night's victory? The Red Sox did what the Mets could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/27/sports/27SERI.html?ex=1098504000&amp;en=a2eba14d8492629a&amp;ei=5070&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; do, and they did it with such style, such force of character, and in the end, so decisively. Hats off to the Sox. Now it's okay, for a moment, for the fans to think that victory in the World Series will be theirs. Having disposed of the terrible foe, wouldn't it be something to see them face their former ace, Roger Clemens, in a cold, snowy game 7 in Boston? Could they win such a game? Could they? That's the amazing thing about baseball, you won't know till it happens. We &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; live to see that. And you'll see that there's another miracle, much smaller, that we can celebrate later today.

The key is to do it through &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.userland.com/manilaNewbies/stories/storyReader$2846&quot;&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt;. In a special Manila site on a server running the BitTorrent software, when you upload a Gem to that site, it automatically generates a meta file, and links to it in the Gems table listing. It's the perfect user interface. The content creator needs to know nothing about the difficult process of Torrent-izing a media file, the URL is handled the same way the non-Torrent URL is handled.

I know I was surprised and pleased that old wounds are healing, and the blogosphere is uniting, in a very nice way. BloggerCon is that kind of event. It's so open, it makes people want to come in. Another cool thing is that we're getting these sponsorships &lt;i&gt;without making editorial concessions.&lt;/i&gt; At the second BC, we went looking for financial help from the big tech companies (because we did away with the admission fee), and found that we would have to give them speaking slots, without telling the people they were paying for the slots. I wouldn't do these deals, although I had learned this is standard practice for tech industry conferences. These contributions are coming without any concessions. There will be people participating from AP, and other companies, and they participate like anyone else (no &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggercon.org/iii/newbies#groundruleNoCommercials&quot;&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt;, though), and they get our special thanks for helping the bloggers.

For example, when Chris Matthews interviewed John Edwards yesterday about the bullshit about the Cheney daughter, the new network would point out that Matthews was doing exactly what everyone was so upset with Kerry about, and by the way, so is Mr Cheney and get this -- so is &lt;i&gt;Mrs&lt;/i&gt; Cheney, who supposedly is so upset. Well if she were really so upset about the exposure of her daughter wouldn't she try to make the controversy go away? Come on really. The hypocrisy is so thick, and everyone knows it.

Basically Adam and I each &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/10/13#When:2:22:47PM&quot;&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; a new server, we're working to get the first one fully functional.

It's good to hear that generic pinging is working. Honestly I hadn't claimed it does, because I wrote the code when I was pretty tired and hadn't yet had a chance to test it.

For example, when Bush listed his excuses for Iraq, he blamed the problems on the generals. He said he asked them if they had enough troops. They said yes. He asked if they were sure they had the right plan. They said yes. Long and drawn out. Kerry said it's the job of the generals to win the war, and it's the job of the President to win the peace. Aside from being nonsense (the President is the Commander-In-Chief, he's the highest military officer, the generals report to him); it was far from the strongest response. Try this instead. &quot;Mr President, the American people hired you to keep them safe. Iraq is &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; responsibility. President Truman, who made the fateful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/bomb.htm&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; that ended World War II, who stood up to General MacArthur and Senator McCarthy, had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trumanlibrary.org/buckstop.htm&quot;&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; on his desk that said &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2004/10/10/dsbuck.jpg&quot;&gt;The Buck Stops Here&lt;/a&gt;.

He's a brilliant guy, I've brainstormed many technical projects with him between 2000 and 2002 or so, when we lost touch. Alex was a tech exec at Netscape at the time they were doing RSS, one of the unsung heroes, IMHO. We talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/10/9/157621.html&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, and tried to figure out, aside from the world being ready for it now, what's new about it, and I said it's XML, which allows a variety of processors acting as user agents. This had come up in the meeting at Microsoft earlier this week, I was singing the praises of RSS, and the lights didn't come on until they realized how much of the work of RSS was done on the client. It looks deceptively simple from the server or content p.o.v. until you realize that the &lt;i&gt;client can run software,&lt;/i&gt; and not just a browser. I do my best thinking with smart people like Alex, and Adam, and some of the new people I've met at Microsoft. And don't forget Scoble. He says he's just marketing &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?q=slime&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&quot;&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;, to which I said, if you're marketing slime, well so am I. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sat, 09 Oct 2004 21:03:55 GMT" type="outline"/>

It just occured to me to ask if he was born in the US, and it turns out he was actually born in Korea. He came here when he was 14. So I asked about his family, and it's quite a story. Now there's a lot of noise on the interview, but I'm going to post it anyway. If you read Don's blog, as I do, you can really get a whole new sense of who he is." created="Tue, 05 Oct 2004 21:45:36 GMT" type="outline"/>

I almost lost my father a couple of years ago, and I'm thankful every day that he pulled through. I know that losing a father, no matter what kind of relationship you had with him, is like ripping out the foundation of a house. Somehow you're supposed to keep functioning, but whether you're aware of it or not, this relationship is central to who you are. We've sure had our differences in the past, Shelley and I, but this transcends all that. God bless, and prayers to the Powers family." created="Tue, 05 Oct 2004 21:48:40 GMT" type="outline"/>

Bush was a little better than I remembered, but Kerry was absolutely perfect. The debate is his medium. Some of the things we thought were stupid, like making a big deal out of his military service at the DNC, were probably brilliant. It didn't matter what we thought at the time, he knew that by now it would be a distant memory. It's the background he needed to be believable as someone who cares about what happens to the people in Iraq. It's almost as if he were laying the groundwork when he was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/greatspeeches/timeline/j_kerry_s.html&quot;&gt;testifying&lt;/a&gt; on coming back from Vietnam. It all fits together, and he skillfully put all the pieces together in the debate. Thanks to the Swifties for running the footage. Bush looked pale in comparison, with just one idea to repeat over and over.

I suspect I'll be okay with that. The screen has a lot of pixels but physically is very small. Great for watching movies. I got some water on the screen, and wiped it off and it left a streak you can see. I tried rubbing it with a dry cloth, but it didn't go away. I'm afraid to do what I usually do with a dirty screen, wipe it with a damp cloth. The most amazing good thing about this laptop is the battery life. The battery that ships with it is good for 3.5 hours. I'm charging the 7-hour battery right now. This is the first laptop I've owned that had a multi-hour battery.
