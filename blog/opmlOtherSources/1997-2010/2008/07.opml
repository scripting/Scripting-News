Unfortunately for Wales and his investors, Google had a 10-year lead, and a huge ecosystem had been built up around it. Google is a thriving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html&quot;&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;, and one doesn't just show up one day with an idea and compete with an ecosystem.

					<outline text="The thinking is likely just as superficial and greedy as Wales' hypothesis that the approach that could unseat Google is the secret sauce that makes Wikipedia work, as if that had anything to do with Wales. It doesn't, anymore than Google needs Larry and Sergey to keep on rolling as a coral reef ecosystem. See, Wikipedia is a coral reef too, and you don't just open shop one day and think that because you can drive flow into your version of Wikipedia that the coral reef will magically assemble on your plot of ocean bottom. Instead what you attract are spammers, as Duncan Riley observes in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://x.techwheat.com/1CX&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; on Inqisitr earlier today." created="Tue, 29 Jul 2008 04:19:51 GMT"/>

Ironically, Knol probably would have fared better if instead of having the appearance of Google tilting the table in its favor, search engine-wise, they had put something in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt&quot;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; file that kept the Google crawler away, so that the opportunists would have stayed away too. That would have given them some time out of the spotlight to build up some real momentum, giving it a chance to compete with Wikipedia. Not sure what Wikia could have done, the idea seemed doomed from the start, because search isn't like a Wiki, and human-authored search results are something of a contradiction." created="Tue, 29 Jul 2008 04:25:46 GMT"/>

TechMeme takes us back to the place that didn't work, where everyone fights for scarce attention. Aside from that, as Wilson notes, TM has made its mind up about us, relative to others, and what's important, vs what's not. (To which I add we're the sentient beings, and TM is a piece of software.

There will be an easy way to view the available tools through a web interface, and quickly download and install them.

In the morning (now) I have more thoughts. If Heath Ledger hadn't died, and if there were two other big performances like his, it might have been on the same level as The Departed, and that's high praise. The other characters and the actors who portrayed them weren't anywhere near as interesting as Ledger's Joker, who unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfr21Rq2A8I&amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;Nicholson's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/7537/joker.htm&quot;&gt;Romero's&lt;/a&gt; -- wasn't funny, at least not in the normal way. He is a pathetic character, wonderfully pathetic. Really something to see. So my first impression last night was pretty lukewarm, but after a few hours it seems more masterful. You could have cut out most of the other scenes and made a movie just about the Joker and that would have been great. Too bad Ledger died.

It's good for identi.ca because they instantly get a base of apps that work with their service. I'd argue that it's even good for Twitter, because it helps to solidify a standard with them as the market leader. The second guy into a market sets the standard, by ratifying the API designed and deployed by the first to market, who is in this case, obviously, Twitter.

					<outline text="Perhaps an analogy will help." created="Mon, 07 Jul 2008 09:29:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Twitter is to identi.ca as an exclusive country club is to a public swimming pool. We might be denied access to Twitter's platform for whatever reason, stated or unstated. This isn't hypothetical, they actually put it in writing. However, they've said they'll recind it. But then they could rescind the rescinding. It's a lot like Apple's policy with developers for the iPhone which might go something like: &quot;We can't let just &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; develop for this.&quot; " created="Mon, 07 Jul 2008 09:29:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="identi.ca is different, like the Internet itself, no one gets to say whether or not you can develop for the platform. Sure one particluar instance of identi.ca might block your app, but they can't &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; block it. (Not entirely true, by the way -- just a lot less likely. Email, an open protocol, does effectively block some spammers from dumping mail through open relays. The real world sometimes forces across-the-board restrictions.)" created="Mon, 07 Jul 2008 09:31:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To understand where we're at, remember that software is a process, you can't judge it by where it is today, you have start with that, and judge how it's evolving. Twitter is struggling with finding a happy scaling place and a business model that sustains it after venture capital. As a corporation, they have incentives that an open source project doesn't have. They're more likely to pay attention to users' needs than an open source project that's more likely to tell you to fix it yourself. Though the lack of a business model has made it less likely that the company views its users as customers. They've been polite, even playful, but the service has been pretty awful.

					<outline text="I was a laggard when I started using Twitter. A lot of people started using it before I did.

					<outline text="And FriendFeed is tacking in the draft behind Twitter, it's growing faster than Twitter did in its early days because people are talking about it not only on their blogs (as they did with Twitter) but also on Twitter itself. It's bootstrapping off Twitter. Same with identi.ca. " created="Mon, 07 Jul 2008 01:40:25 GMT"/>

					<outline text="We noticed this with the growth of podcasting in 2004 into 2005. Once we had the right combination of features and content, it grew like a weed, growing in four months what it had taken the blogosphere four years to do (probably more, depending on what you want to call the start of blogging).
