I don't support that and I'll argue with John about that  assessment. It's a cheap shot. I know what it feels like to have someone say that about my software, stuff I worked hard on, and didn't charge money for. I don't put any less effort into making it usable when I am giving it away. To this day people say that about &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanilla.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; because we give them free hosting on machines that are carrying a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.users.wineasy.se/daniel/onthenight.html#tre&quot;&gt;heavy&lt;/a&gt; load. And while it can be painful to hear, there's a deeper truth that the open source advocates can't hide from. They're really saying &quot;I can't complain because I didn't pay for it.&quot; So to use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/12/30#marketRelativity&quot;&gt;Doc-ism&lt;/a&gt;, there's no market conversation about open source.

				<outline text="Now it's interesting to note that, as far as I know, no one has ever said &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; about &quot;XML-RPC&quot;. This says to me that, intuitively, people know that formats and protocols should be free of cost and totally open. Maybe &quot;should&quot; is too weak a word -- maybe it's &quot;must.&quot; I believe this in my heart, it's something I take for granted. If there's a toll on the road, developers will wait until something without a toll comes along. And this may be the line where open source makes sense, maybe finally we can put the debate to rest -- open source can stop snarling, and accept its place as the province of would-be standard-setters. Commercial vs open source is like a hot and cold water valve on a faucet. Where you want competition, give away the technology. Where you want to be competitive, keep it to yourself.

He says that UserLand is the most open commercial company he knows. This is because we tweak the valves to get the right temperature to come out the faucet. I figured this out in a new way after watching VA and CollabNet tweak their offerings to include some hot water in their mixes. I also had a long talk with James Barry in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jabbercon.com/&quot;&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; in August, he's an ex-IBMer who was at CollabNet then (and now is CTO at Jabber).

					<outline text="We started on the Web in 1995 as an app &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/masonHale.html&quot;&gt;running behind Webstar&lt;/a&gt;, when Frontier was seven years old. Webstar was not open source, but still played the role Mark talks about. Platforms are platforms, whether it's open source or not matters not one bit. The API Webstar defined was as open as Apache's and was emulated by all other Web servers on the Mac platform. (Another non-open source platform, probably as big as Apache, if not bigger in terms of software and developer hours invested.) " created="Sun, 30 Dec 2001 03:58:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Eventually we outgrew the limited API of Webstar (or more realistically the inertia that comes from a broadly supported standard). Frontier is so much more than Apache ever will be, getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1006&quot;&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;control&lt;/a&gt; to flow over HTTP is a small (but significant) part of what Frontier does, and it does it much more completely than Apache.

No one fights for simplicity, and if they do they are ground into submission by the compromisers. You don't need a degree in rocket science to figure out what's going to fly.

It's a story of creative people who work hard who get pissed off at all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=niggling&quot;&gt;niggling&lt;/a&gt; little idiots who try to tell them what to do, so they create a haven to hide in while the world outside falls apart. Then they come back, and everyone says how much they missed them. It's not a great book, for adults -- it appeals to the adolescent pov, basically They'll Miss Me When I'm Gone. (The sad truth of adulthood is that they won't. Sorry I didn't make the rules.) But it's not a &lt;i&gt;worthless&lt;/i&gt; book. It's just that people try to attach so much meaning to the story that just plain isn't realistic, it isn't how the world actually works. No one is so pure as the heroes of Atlas Shrugged. And the whole &quot;objectivist&quot; rant is arrogant. Oh I see, if I were objective I would see it your way. Feh. That gets in the way of the fun of the story.

We get to learn about his style and the tricks he uses to make his work succeed. We can see this because it is the nature of creative writing that the writing is public. There is no such thing as language that conveys meaning while not simultaneously transmitting its words. Software is different: Software gets compiled, and the compiled code is essentially unreadable; but in order to copyright software, the author need not reveal the source code. Thus, while the English department gets to analyze Virginia Woolf's novels to train its students in better writing, the computer science department doesn't get to examine Apple's operating system to train its students in better coding.&quot; " created="Fri, 21 Dec 2001 19:20:38 GMT"/>

It was so loose that there wasn't even the implication of trust of the user. The culture of Napster was use it and you don't have to pay for it. That was bad, imho. But the brutal DRM response is to try to make it technically very difficult if not impossible to use something without paying for it.

What a shame, because as a software developer who creates products for Windows, I want the users to move up to XP because it is a much better operating system than the old DOS-derived assembly language non-modern OSes that MS used to sell.

Maybe therein lies the problem for Microsoft. They don't really have anyone's support. And further, there are no killer apps floating around for XP. Now with all possible humility I think I have one in the pipe. Can't we work something out Microsoft? A win-win. I'd like to recommend XP. Can you take out the phone-home features, and just ship a no-nonsense OS that isn't all about DRM and doesn't crash and supports modern Internet apps. I support your wish to be paid for your software. I have the same wish. But you got us in a tough corner. How about easing up a bit?" created="Thu, 20 Dec 2001 16:12:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Moral of the story -- blockbuster OSes are created by killer apps. Windows 95 was blockbuster because of MSIE and Outlook Express -- ie, the Internet. Going back earlier, Mac OS was a raging success because of MacWrite and MacPaint, and then Pagemaker and Excel. Windows 3.0 was a blockbuster because graphics apps are so much more powerful and easy to use than character-based apps. XP's beauty is invisible until some app comes along and makes it clear why a normal user should care about its beefy reliability. DRM is a negative sell, it's a reason &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to upgrade, the opposite of a killer app, it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=douse&quot;&gt;douser&lt;/a&gt; app. I think the users sniffed this one out.

I was expecting to be angry about this -- no good deed goes unpunished eh, but he explained it so well that it got through my thick American skull. The story goes like this. They &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; that we kicked Saddam out of Kuwait and protected Saudi Arabia from invasion by Iraq. What they don't like is understandable. We left him in power in Iraq, with helicopters and weapons, and encouraged the people of Iraq to revolt, and some of them did. He slaughtered them and we did nothing to help. In my own small way I can relate. This is how I feel about the US settlement with Microsoft. Now the slaughter will begin. The US attitude about the non-western world is indeed that they are uncivilized and that all we care about is if they have tyrants who are friendly to our government. Saddam's crime wasn't that he was a despot, it was that his despotism threatened the US. What I'm hearing is familiar, it's the voice of people who want respect.

					<outline text="The Radio UserLand 7.1 release will happen just after the holidays, in early January. The software is getting quite solid. There's much more work to do on the docs, both on the Web and the words baked into the product, and we're also getting a good process for fixes and new features, so we'll use the time over the holidays to get all that going, and maybe even get a few days off here and there. It's been a long push, starting in April. We'll ship in January."/>
					<outline text="This is the first release of Radio that's commercial. Everyone wants to know the price. I can't say now exactly what the price is, but it's under $100. Thirty day free trial. Like any point-one release, the functionality isn't dramatically different from 7.0. Its purpose is weblog writing and RSS-based news reading. But when you lift the hood on 7.1, it's a different CMS, one that's suited for hobbyists and technical end-users. It's got an easy ramp, and builds on knowledge people have about other dynamic Web servers, such as PHP and ASP, but goes a lot further because it's a CMS. The point in the underpinnings of 7.1 is power &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; accessibility. That's why we're making the investment in developer docs. We want a lot of people to do development in 7.1." created="Fri, 14 Dec 2001 17:29:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Of course, you want to know what OSes it runs on. All flavors of Windows, but since it's a server, it works a lot better on the modern Windows OSes -- Windows 2000 and Windows XP. It also runs on the classic version of Macintosh OS, but as with Windows, you'll like it better if you use Mac OS X. It will ship as a native Mac OS X app. " created="Fri, 14 Dec 2001 17:38:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Bottom-line: A lot of people are ready to run a Web server on their desktop. Unlike other servers, this one comes with some great user-level apps pre-installed. Software that pushes the envelope on what the Web can do, not demo apps, or mere Hello Worlds, but software that's worth using. And unlike the other Web servers, this one has a fast CMS baked in. Mature code, debugged, it works, it's not a science experiment, it's technology you can use to create fantastic new applications for the Internet. And it's all built on open standards, no lock-in, connect to everything, and there's a lot &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/12/14/userlandAsAnOutline.gif&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; coming from where all this came from." created="Fri, 14 Dec 2001 17:40:56 GMT"/>

Something about the trip really freaked Nurse out, and she never was the same. She got a hard edge, but she still was the most amazing cat. She'd go on walks with you, like a dog, and she had a litter of kittens, and she killed birds by the bushel. Then I ended up in a house that didn't allow pets, and it was time to put her up for adoption. A farmer from rural Wisconsin took her, he needed a mouser to live in his barn. I was sad to see her go, but I'll bet she was a great mouser. " created="Wed, 05 Dec 2001 14:41:10 GMT"/>

I took their philosophy with me to CP/M, then the Apple II, then the IBM PC, then Macintosh, then the Web. Along the road I met many others who had adopted the lightweight do-it-then-use-it attitude of Unix. Lohr says that their philosophy resurfaced in the &quot;open source movement&quot; in the 90s.

I felt that our software could be positioned in that area, that people who were interested in KM would also be interested weblogs and outliners. But today I'm understanding the subject in a whole new way. We need KM at UserLand, desperately, always have, and knew it (without knowing what it was called), and didn't know that the &lt;i&gt;philosophy&lt;/i&gt; of KM would offer us a way to get over this in the management of our own work." created="Sat, 01 Dec 2001 17:51:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's the problem stated from a UserLand perspective. When a developer starts working on a feature or a system, we get formal. The developer writes an &quot;RFC&quot;. It addresses issues like prior art, breakage, scaling (if it's a centralized service) and user interface issues (depending on who the intended user is). Most important, it helps the reader visualize the software, and this is relatively easy to do, because at RFC-time, the developer hasn't seen it, no one has. These documents are excellent, partially because the developer is communicating with friends, he relaxes, and the writing is good, even excellent." created="Sat, 01 Dec 2001 17:53:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But here's the problem -- when it comes time to write docs for users -- the system breaks down. The excellent writing is lost. The developer, tasked with explaining the feature to users and outside-UserLand developers gets &quot;in his head&quot; and the docs are incomplete, sometimes grossly so, and miss the mark. The problem is a KM problem. How can we get the excellent writing done at the beginning of a project to flow out to the users and developers when the project is complete?" created="Sat, 01 Dec 2001 17:55:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="See if this matches your experience with UserLand. How well are our systems designed? I think very well. Now, how much work do you have to do to figure out how to use them? Far too much." created="Sat, 01 Dec 2001 17:57:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We're still struggling with this. For our next ship I want to have complete docs, but I know we won't.

We have a fulltime guy here who's main job is that. Flowing information from the team and users into a permanent structure of documents, accessible over the Web." created="Sat, 01 Dec 2001 17:58:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The frustrating thing is that we know &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; what questions people will ask. We even know the answers. The challenge is to get them where people find them. That's a total KM problem. Now of course once we solve the problem, we'll commercialize it, and offer it for sale. This is our business.
