					<outline text="Early Wednesday morning (in California) I &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/1669&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a proposed roadmap to sort out the confusion in RSS. Key points. The term RSS will only apply to 0.91 and 0.90, that (at least) two forks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=emanate&quot;&gt;emanate&lt;/a&gt; from there, one containing the changes in 0.92, and the other for the continuation of the philosophy of the RDF group. Both forks choose new names."/>

					<outline text="A personal note, one way or the other, this will be my exit point as the defacto leader of the &quot;simple&quot; branch. I feel the urgency to move beyond the politics, the market is starting to shape up in new ways, and I want to be part of that, not mired in a struggle over what RSS is. However, I didn't want to exit without at least proposing a plan for forward motion."/>

I kept thinking about how this was weird, and I'd have some explaining to do, but then think about all the people who would be using my software and that appeared to balance things, but I still felt uncertain. Then I programmed a little music player page, and clicked a button and all of a sudden beautiful music came out of the speakers for everyone to hear and they all started dancing a smart competent dance. As I turned the knobs on the control panel a smart competent Microsoft person showed up and I said &quot;Hey this is cool, can people record this music?&quot; The Microsoft person rubbed the back of my neck in a respectful and understanding way and said &quot;No&quot; and walked away.

					<outline text="We had a creative year in 2000, now organizing all that creativity is a big job. This means creating new basic building blocks.

I'm like a researcher trying to piece together a sequence of historic events. I often have to stop and dive deep into something to find a hard-coded folder path, or an assumption made that is not valid anymore. It's good work to do, because we couldn't have built much further on the foundation that we had. It's also a loop back to some ideas we started exploring in 1997 but didn't pursue as the cross-platform work consumed so much of our bandwidth."/>
					<outline text="Why do all this work? Because our model is changing to combine centralization with &lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt;centralization. Yesterday I talked about the big changes that Microsoft must deal with, I used the word &quot;our&quot; with regard to the challenge, because we face those changes too. Taken as a given: There's less financial support for centralization since the dotcom bust. Microsoft is hell-bent to make centralization pay. That's cool. UserLand is too small to hope to be able to do that, so we go the other way, accept the reality (as we see it) and re-tool accordingly. But still give the users all that they want. That makes it challenging, but that's why software is an interesting art."/>

I said there has to be another revolution coming. When we get into these kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=doldrums&quot;&gt;doldrums&lt;/a&gt; it creates space for something new.

				<outline text="Now, that's a lofty topic, and it will be hard to keep the people we invite on-topic. And there's a big question about the format of the show. Part of me favors an empty stage, I roam the audience with a microphone, with famous people sprinkled throughout, never knowing when their turn is going to come. However, this probably won't work in this venue because the room at Moscone is large. I did one of these last year, about Napster, and it came off pretty well, but there were big gaps while I ran from one side of the room to the other.

				<outline text="In the 1980s and 1990s there was a debate about whether or not you could completely insulate the user from the file system. All the files that make up an operating system must be in very particular places. Same with apps and web servers. So we, collectively, decided to try to hide these things from users. A line was drawn between easy and hard to use that left the newbies lost in a world where they can't find anything they wrote more than eight hours ago, and fragile poorly understood file system structures that even a commited expert couldn't always figure out. Windows had the philosophy that it was necessary for users to see the file system. Mac users had a superior attitude, but I don't know how deserved it was. Now I hear that Windows XP is going to put the filesystem out of the users' view.

				<outline text="Priorities for XML-RPC and SOAP" created="Fri, 04 May 2001 05:04:44 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="As we started making progress on the interop testing in SOAP and then XML-RPC, I started working on a list of new priorities, for the post-interop period (which I hope lasts for years). Today I added a new priority, deployment. But it seems a good time to review them all: interop, apps, deployment, business development."/>
					<outline text="1. Interop is a process that goes on forever. There will always be new toolkits coming online. However, with every passing month interop will get easier. Related to interop, I plan to do a revision of the &quot;BDG&quot;, perhaps Jake can do the work, to remove the concept of a &quot;subset&quot; from the document. It's finally sunk in that it's not a subset. We've had continuing talks about the philosophy of interop, esp as it relates to what interop means in HTTP. No two web servers, even ones running the same software, support the same URL structure. You can't throw any random request at any Web server and get a non-404 response. In the same sense no two SOAP servers will be able to do anything with any random message sent to it. So rejecting a message cleanly and informing the client, per the spec, of what went wrong, means you're implementing the protocol, not a subset of the protocol. The pushback on this came from Andrew Layman, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, and Keith Ballinger of Microsoft; and Sam Ruby of IBM. Thanks. "/>
					<outline text="2. Apps. Remember the search for killer apps we did in April? Let's keep doing that, repeat the loop periodically, systematically, infinitely. One day a month, let's do a roundup of application development in XML-RPC and SOAP. Apps are the reason we're doing the interop work. I'm encouraging people who do toolkits to start thinking about apps. But there's an obstacle in the way for some people. See the next priority."/>
					<outline text="3. Deployment. This is the new one. I added this to the list as a result of a phone conversation with a toolkit developer, Dan Libby (the same guy we worked with on RSS when he was at Netscape, small world). Dan says he would clone &quot;xmlStorageSystem&quot; if he had a place to deploy it. I offered space in our cloud, but I would really prefer if someone else worked directly with Dan, instead of adding to the workload here. However, if no one else steps up, we'll do it, because without deployment the apps basically don't exist. (If a tree falls in the forest.. etc.)"/>
					<outline text="There's another side to deployment, I'd like to see scripting environments bake SOAP and XML-RPC into their releases. Make it easier for script writers in all environments to have the same ease-of-access that Microsoft's developers are sure to have. The rest of us shouldn't be playing catch-up as Microsoft deploys. The roadmap is clear, and as interop becomes more solid, the reasons to hold back will be fewer. If you manage a scripting environment, please consider making XML-RPC and SOAP part of your standard install. Even better if operating system vendors other than Microsoft add user interfaces for easy scripting both client side and servers. This isn't as far off in the future as one might think. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="4. Business development. Why are we doing all this work? Well, I think most of us love the idea of having lots of choice in development environments, and like creating cool software. But there are bills to pay. UserLand wants to license tools and runtimes. Others want consulting gigs. So last week I added this to the list of priorities. If you'd like to add XML-RPC expertise to your team, we know the people who can do that. If you have a job opening, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/edit/newTopic&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; it on the DG on XML-RPC.Com, or send me an email. It's still a buyer's market, I hope not for long."/>

Why can't users who prefer the Microsoft OS get the benefit of your software, if you've linked up to their OS in such a way that you're not locked in. On the other hand, a reasonable person who doesn't want to be locked in could predict that Microsoft, based on past behavior, is likely to do something to get you and your users locked in. Microsoft's pitch would be more convincing if they acknowledged this. "/>

				<outline text="&lt;a title=&quot;Would you like to uninstall Word? That's not really a good idea, since everyone uses Word, and if you don't have a copy on your system you won't be able to read the documents they send you.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/paperClipGoodbyeFuckOff.gif&quot; height=&quot;78&quot; width=&quot;52&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When I open a file in Microsoft Word it takes a couple of minutes to fail to open the file. Then I open it again, and it fails, but Word launches and the paper clip reminds me that I can enter a date by pressing some weird key combo. Then I open it a third time and the file opens. But my machine gets really slow. I read the document, close the file, quit Word, but now every other program is very slow at echoing my characters. The only way to cure the problem is to restart the system." created="Tue, 01 May 2001 05:14:46 GMT" type="outline"/>
