				<outline text="Apple on board">
					<outline text="I note, with pleasure, that SOAP and XML-RPC are on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/wwdc2001/descriptions.html#607&quot;&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; at Apple's WWDC starting May 21 in San Jose. "/>
					<outline text="I hope the Mac developer community embraces these protocols, they're very good for the Mac, imho, because they allow lots of choice, no one knows what OS is at the other end of the pipe. "/>
					<outline text="This is how the Windows monopoly can ease, by making it safe and easy to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use Windows."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Can't touch that">
					<outline text="Some people still think deployed formats and protocols can change. This is a major disconnect. People on mail lists think that &quot;everyone&quot; is here, and that they all can change their implementations just because some people think they know how to do it better. "/>
					<outline text="However, in the real world, once code is deployed to customers, if you change the formats, you break the users. So there comes a point beyond which you cannot change the format, if you care about the users. If you're in business, you have to care about the users. Almost every mistake we make is when we decide our point of view is more important. "/>
					<outline text="This happened last summer when some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; people tried to take over &quot;RSS&quot;. I was left saying but but what about the users? Well the revolution didn't happen, predictably, and imho the revolutionaries did more to break RSS than Netscape did when they turned off their servers last week. We're still picking up the pieces from both breakage events."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss&quot;&gt;9/2/00&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;In the overworked world of Web development, there's no time to study, there's only time to do.&quot;"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="SOAP 1.1 deployment">
					<outline text="A breakage-related discussion is going on on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders&quot;&gt;soapbuilders&lt;/a&gt; list. Some people think we should change the way we use the SOAPAction header. (Or do they? The messages are confusing.) Others think we should change schemas. Oy the breakage that would fall out from that. No way."/>
					<outline text="Meanwhile, as the arguments develop, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/microsoftDeployingSoap.gif&quot;&gt;Microsoft is deploying&lt;/a&gt;, which means very soon we must lock down our SOAP stack and say &quot;This Is It,&quot; this is what we will support for perpetuity, so UserLand customers, please start deploying, and of course that will be good, even when new people come along and say we're doing it wrong, which according to Murphy's Law, which applies to protocol specs, they surely will. In my humble opinion, the time for that is passing &lt;i&gt;quickly.&lt;/i&gt; We published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; to explain our practice, and we think it's a solid basis for our software interoperating with others. "/>
					<outline text="BTW, we're trying to avoid the situation where SOAP interop means &quot;Works With Microsoft,&quot; which as I've said &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/03/29/unstallingSoap#myChoice&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; would be a failure for SOAP."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="RDF query">
					<outline text="What is it about the culture of RDF that says &quot;All your spec belong to us.&quot; I saw a presentation at the W3C Web Services Workshop where a nice man from Colorado explained how SOAP could be RDF-ized. While he was speaking I was wondering why they don't create their own revolution, then we can support them. Instead they try to impose their point of view on us, they must wonder why everyone runs away when they show up."/>

					<outline text="I always introduce my guest to Lee, she has a fantastic memory, so I said, and this is my friend.. (Gulp. His name &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Doc!) ..Doctor Searls. I had to explain that he's not &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; a doctor, and then Lee said she isn't either, and I admitted the same was true for me. We all had a good laugh and went on with our dinner."/>

				<outline text="Strategy Tax">
					<outline text="Hey some people who write books have an idea which book I'm reading, and am almost finished with. Before you gloat too much, it became a great book around chapter 4. When it comes out I'm going to recommend everyone who wants to understand how the Web became a disaster read it so we can make sure it never happens again. "/>
					<outline text="First, there were people at Microsoft, notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/business/html98/web_19990613.html&quot;&gt;Ben Slivka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/issues/1422/pcm00085.htm&quot;&gt;Brad Silverberg&lt;/a&gt;, who would probably have endorsed my &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/06/16/howToSettleTheMicrosoftCase&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; that the browser be in a separate company, and not tied to Windows. "/>
					<outline text="According to the book, most of the mid-level managers, who actually met separately, would have endorsed it too. The &quot;Strategy Tax&quot; is a big issue inside Microsoft, and nowhere was the penalty felt as deeply as in MSIE. There's no doubt that lock-in is the Big Thing for both Gates and Ballmer and the product people are restricted from doing anything that could undermine Windows, even in subtle ways."/>
					<outline text="What else? Ballmer didn't understand how the Web worked until 1998. Get that. He's making big decisions for the Web, and didn't even bother to find out what it is. How humiliating is that? It's probably true of Gates as well. One thing's for sure, neither of them loved the Web, yet we're supposed to trust them with the Web browser. This is a source of much friction."/>
					<outline text="As I suspected they could have avoided the antitrust trial, easily. Gates is not much-loved in his own company (that was a surprise). What else did I learn? Well, I know this is just one point of view. But the story resonates with my experience. It's so funny that they want to get a developer thing going again, when they spent the last eight years undermining the developers. They're in for a rude surprise when we don't all flock to their latest lock-in strategy. "/>
					<outline text="Bottom-line, the software industry, like every other industry, must have competition. Microsoft is a dead-zone for lots of former competitive categories. When a category gets sucked into Microsoft it ends up in Bill's mind, and dies. They can argue all they want (they do) but it's empirically evident. You'd have to be blind not to see it. They still want to own everything. "/>
					<outline text="It's the most centralized system imaginable. All ideas die in Microsoft. Well enough of that. If the Microsoft people hate the strategy tax, what about the rest of us? Why should we pay that tax? I don't get it. "/>
					<outline text="Now more than ever we have to work together. No lock in. Lots of good little companies. Goodbye to the death star. Become a bank, venture capitalist, consulting company, whatever. Sell your operating system. They wonder why the developers don't flock to Windows anymore. They poisoned the well. Geez. It's so obvious. "/>
					<outline text="To the rest of us, they're only 45,000 people. If we ever started listening to and helping each other they wouldn't have a chance at domination. Interestingly the answer is right in our faces. It's called the Internet. They use it at Microsoft. They have to work with each other, a little. If we could do the same, outside of Microsoft, we could skip a few more years of fighting with them over our future."/>

What does all this have to do with the Web? That's a serious question. To me, the Web is about brain-dead simplicty at the expense of functionality. User interfaces of the 1980s were far richer, even in a limited environment like Hypercard, than the Web. The Web trades off all that richness for developer simplicity. The platform-specific RPC mechanisms were also much more complex. The Web cleans it all up. "/>

They own the browser. The Web is this fantastic medium. Still. The last five years or so are kind of a blur. The book is more a timeline than anything. A way to review what happened. Channels, ActiveX, Active Desktop. It brings it back in focus. Here we are stuck with this gorilla, owning this thing they don't understand, and it's incredibly precious and important. All they want to do is sell Windows. Why couldn't they leave the Web alone, and sell Windows. Or if they &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to get involved, why couldn't they make software that's good for the Web. I know I know I can hear them say &quot;Well our software is better than Netscape's right?&quot; Yeah but your software isn't better than the Netscape competitors that never had a chance. "/>

Have I ever told you about my idea for the Corporate Death Penalty? First, let me be clear that I'm against capital punishment for people, strongly so, but curiously I would have no problem with the death penalty for corporations that behave recklessly with resources that don't belong to them. For example, I would have put &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exxon.com/index_flash.html&quot;&gt;Exxon&lt;/a&gt; to death for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/photos/exxon/19.html&quot;&gt;Valdez disaster&lt;/a&gt; to set an example for other would be rapers of the environment. And I would put AOL to death for holding the Web hostage to whatever stupid games they're playing. I told this idea to Scoble, in jest, talking about Microsoft, and he said &quot;Dave then you'd have two Microsofts.&quot; I said &quot;Scoble you don't get it, after the death penalty, there would be zero Microsofts, not two.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="Amateurs and prose">
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2001/04/22&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt; is really tuning into the amateur writing thing. This morning he linked to an excellent Bill Moyer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/docPrint.mhtml?i=20010507&amp;s=moyers&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; on journalism and democracy. But Dan, I don't buy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=gifted&quot;&gt;gifted&lt;/a&gt; part. It's a little condescending. Children are gifted, adults have respect for each other. (Of course kids deserve respect too. That's another thing you learn on the Internet.) "/>
					<outline text="Here's some pushback on Glenn's most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://glennf.com/blog/2001/04/22.html&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Once you get paid for doing something, you're not an amateur. The term has become dirtied by the assumption that somehow amateur is lower quality than professional. If you stop and think about the constraints that pros operate under (read the Moyers piece) it's clear that the opposite is true. &quot;Before Mutual of America I had lost at least three corporate underwriters, who were happy as long as we didn't make anyone else unhappy. Losing your underwriting will keep the yellow light of caution flickering in a journalist's unconscious.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="One more thing, a reader points out that I've been doing first-hand personal accounts longer than Bricklin or Williams. It's true, but never, until the Times piece, to balance press coverage, and generally as a solo act. Imagine if Bill Gates had written an essay to go along with one I wrote about SOAP. That would have been interesting. Two sides of the same story from different points of view, without intermediaries."/>
					<outline text="For some reason I'm still figuring out, that I wrote first-hand accounts meant I almost never got press coverage for the new stuff I was doing. Talking with a reporter last week I asked why. He said reporters don't like to do stories that have already been written. (I thought the opposite was true.) At some point that I'm not aware of they accepted me as One Of Them, so if it appeared on Scripting News or in DaveNet, the story had already been done, and they didn't want to do it. Huh? Oh my. Wrong!"/>
					<outline text="There is indeed a difference between what I do and what the BigPubs do. I'm an amateur. I make software. I write because I love to write, and because I want to make sure that my side gets out there without interference. That's why, once the editorial weenies swooped in at Wired and started inverting my ideas, I was out of there like a puff of smoke in a Roadrunner cartoon."/>
					<outline text="But I loved writing at Wired. The respect was intoxicating. One company took my words of praise and pasted them all over their tradeshow booth. &quot;Dave Winer, HotWired&quot; it said in 80K point. It felt great. But I also encountered the corporate sponsorship thing. At a party, editor-publisher Louis Rosetto introduced me to one of Wired's biggest advertisers, an American vice-president of a Japanese company, Fujitsu, Toshiba, or something like that. I listened to his pitch for a minute, and interrupted with a question. &quot;Don't you make a clone?&quot; I asked. He gulped. Then I thought I saw a light go on. He looked at Louis, and Louis at me, with disapproval. They walked away. I felt owned."/>
					<outline text="To Dan, who is concerned about the business models for the BigPubs, they could ace us any day they want to change. Get rid of the nudges and winks, and really set us free. Perform an editorial function, add resources and distribution, even branding, but let the voices come through clearly. I'd say we're 25 percent of the way through a route-around. Embrace the change asap, find the integrity in business and work with it. The Internet makes it possible, even necessary, to compete with integrity. That's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=sea%20change&quot;&gt;sea change&lt;/a&gt;."/>

When Mr. Gates bought the archive, the plan was to digitize all its images. But the time it will take to digitize those pictures has proved to be longer than many of the pictures themselves will last, unless they are properly stored. As a result, the archive is destined for archival refrigeration 220 feet below ground in a limestone mine not far from Pittsburgh.&quot;"/>

I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=snooker&quot;&gt;snookered&lt;/a&gt; into a quick project that should be a lot of fun. I'm writing the foreword to a book that I believe in. It's my second in the last year. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/12/22/aBriefUserInterfaceManifesto&quot;&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; to Joel Spolsky's book on software design that must be coming out any day now. I look forward (not foreword) to that, because we'll be citing Joel's book in the future. The same for the book I'm writing the foreword for now, which is a secret project that I can't talk about."/>
					<outline text="12:12PM, I've finished the first draft of the foreword. 1599 words. A productive writing session. 12:46PM, after an edit, 1654 words. Second edit, 1445 words. Starting to converge. "/>

If they come to fruition you'll slap yourself on the forehead and say &quot;I can't believe those people are working together!&quot; It's a thing to behold, eventually enough time passes, old animosities become less important, or the people change, or new people are in charge, history is forgotten, and there are reasons to make philosophies and software compatible, and that's what happens, again, given enough time."/>

					<outline text="Secrets. I hate them and I love them. I hate writing long-lead-time pieces, because I've never trained my mind to do them. As I'm writing a piece I wonder what will people say about this or that. I try to imagine a reader. Now when I'm writing real-time, as I am now, I know that as soon as I press Control-S, someone is going to read it. And if they have something to say they'll tell me. This is publishing at 800 mph. But if you've got a long lead time, as book authors do, it's much slower. Hey I'm a feedback junkie. I admit it. Can I break the habit? Yes. Do I want to? Hmmm."/>
					<outline text="Speaking of junkies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/04/21&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; is a self-acknowledged &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; junkie. He says he has a black belt in MORE. This makes me happy because (I know this sounds sappy but it's true) I write software for guys like Doc. What a lot of loops close here. I'm learning about Knowledge Management, which is a hot concept in BigCo consulting. I'm learning that Manila plus outlining is pretty close to the core of KM. I dream of an outliners convention. I want to get a bunch of them in a room and talk about the future. That's what's cool about outliner people. They have a clue about the future. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="BTW, Doc says that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.well.com/user/sbb/&quot;&gt;Stewart Brand&lt;/a&gt; is an outliner guy. I didn't know that."/>
					<outline text="People think I don't like BigCo's, hey sometimes I even think I don't -- but that's where the money is. They pay for software. Same old story. That was the upshot of the copy protection rebellion in the mid-80s. The software companies that survived were the ones who made products for people who pay. It sounds obvious, but sometimes the most obvious truths are the most elusive."/>

Three people have asked if my view about writing is in conflict with my view of software. It may be, but that doesn't mean I don't believe the last sentence. "/>
					<outline text="Probably the highest-integrity software is the stuff you create for yourself, to express something that's inside of you that demands expressing. Doing anything &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; to make money makes it all weird. We certainly have seen a fair amount of that in the last few years in the dotcom distortion. I don't think open source, as some people have said, equates to individual web writing. I put copyrights on everything I write, all rights reserved. You can't legally take my writing and put your name on it. This is about as far from open source as you can get, although there are enough different open source licenses to make almost any statement about open source null and void."/>
					<outline text="Anyway, on more reflection, my software work may not have as much integrity as my writing work. A lot of the software work I do is to make Frontier, Manila and Radio useful for other people, and to please them. I still work for myself though, so perhaps there's more integrity in what I do than there is for software people who work for others. Remember, integrity does not equal goodness. "/>
					<outline text="However, a lot of the work I do in DaveNet is for the same cause. If I just wanted to express my own ideas so that I would benefit, I could write more quickly and be more direct. Maybe I should try that. Regardless, I wrote the last sentence of that piece carefully. Give it some thought, I think you'll see it's true."/>

					<outline text="Like people who develop software for BigCo's, people who write for BigPub's don't like to think about themselves that way. I know, and I'm sorry, but there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a difference in attitude that comes from having a big brand behind you, and a different result comes out the other end.

				<outline text="Editorial note">
					<outline text="To new people coming here from various articles that have been written about us in the last few weeks, here's a brief explanation of how it works."/>
					<outline text="My name is Dave Winer. I write here in real-time. I make mistakes and correct them, when I see them, but sometimes they stay. All the back issues are archived, accessible through the calendar in the right column on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;. Every night at 10PM the contents of Scripting News goes out via email to several thousand people who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userland.com/dailyUpdates&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt;. And several dozen people receive Scripting News via RSS syndication, and I expect that will grow over time."/>
					<outline text="Scripting News is where my ideas get a chance to be refined before (when I have the time) I write a more formal essay about them, in &quot;DaveNet&quot;. Sometimes things are moving so fast that I just write real-time in DaveNet, but that's pretty exceptional. "/>
					<outline text="DaveNet is our oldest editorial product. It started in &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1994&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, and was the beginning of something that's become much bigger than just one guy keeping a log of the ideas he wants to give away for free."/>

Andrew Layman of Microsoft. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$683&quot;&gt;Sanjiva&lt;/a&gt;, the IBM guy who wrote the SOAP for Java that's now part of Apache. "/>
					<outline text="One of those magic moments. So many smart people. A basic disagreement. How many SOAP stacks will there be? I want (picking a number out of the air) one hundred. Most were not agreeing with me. I looked at Andrew but said to the group, how well is it going now that there's one browser?"/>
					<outline text="Every great creative market has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=cacophony&quot;&gt;cacophony&lt;/a&gt; of diversity. I've been lucky to be part of several booming markets, the Apple II, IBM PC, Macintosh, and the early Web. The thing they all had in common was a constant stream of surprising products. Customers lining up to buy stuff. Pacts between gorillas never lead to this kind of creativity. "/>

				<outline text="I've been thinking about next steps in SOAP 1.1 interop. We seem to be getting through the wire level, so the next thing is to have a set of criteria for application-level interop. I understand that there are lots of potential uses for SOAP, but our interest is in the Web as a writing environment. I also understand that the world revolves around Microsoft until we prove otherwise. So here's the benchmark I propose. First, deliver a multi-vendor SOAP-based writing-publishing system that uses no Microsoft software. Then switch out the non-Microsoft components with Microsoft pieces, where they exist, one at a time, and have it still work."/>

				<outline text="After the article in the NY Times has sunk in, I no longer read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html&quot;&gt;editorial page&lt;/a&gt; of the Times with any idea that there's a philosophy behind it, or any integrity. After the dust has settled, after talking with one of the other people who was interviewed by the Times for Monday's article, I know that in this case, the thesis, the &quot;news&quot; was entirely a Times invention. Glenn Fleishman, who I respect, makes excuses for them. I don't accept the excuses. The article was about &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; views. It wasn't an accurate reflection of my views, and there's no excuse for that."/>
				<outline text="On April 4, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap11#theSkyIsBlue&quot;&gt;public piece&lt;/a&gt; where I said: &quot;Last week at this time I was uncertain of SOAP interop, now I'm optimistic. It's been a fantastic week of negotiation and cooperation, with ups and downs for sure, lots of misunderstandings, but we seem to have gotten through it and arrived at the ending I was hoping for -- software running in widely different environments, some open source, some commercial, some from Microsoft, and all of it working together.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="That piece ran &lt;i&gt;five days&lt;/i&gt; before the Times piece and totally contradicts their thesis. Clearly they were reading my pieces (the Times piece was a stitched-together set of quotes from my essays). They should have changed the theme of the piece, or they should have dropped the story. The path they took had no integrity. It is so frustrating that the mission we're on has so much integrity, and that the Times, which is supposed to be a &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; of integrity, took a serious chance at screwing it up. For what purpose? "/>
				<outline text="I sent an email to Markoff. &quot;I want to bring integrity back to software, and your integrity is part of this. How can I get Microsoft to play fair when you give them all the ammo they need to say the system isn't fair. They're right about that. I gave it some more thought and dammit, I agree with Charles, you are carrying an axe, and I have no faith that you would report on the good news when we really deliver it, which it looks like we're doing. If Microsoft pulled a stunt like the one you did, I'd be all over them. I decided that I can have no integrity if I don't call you on this.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="The cynical view is that they spelled my name right and the ink is good for my company. Well, I'm not a cynic. Sue me. I hate cynics. A publication with a lot less rep than the Times ran an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetworld.com/031501/03.15.01interview1.jsp&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about my philosophy in this area.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://glennf.weblogs.com/2001/04/11&quot;&gt;Glenn Fleishman picks&lt;/a&gt; up the ball (thanks) in the ongoing argument with reporters talking about weblogs who think the world revolves around Blogger and Evan's friends. As I said on &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/04/10/theAmazingStoryOfSoapAndMicrosoft#theAmazingStoryOfSoapAndMicrosoft&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, weblogs have changed the technology world far beyond what reporters are comfortable writing about. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/emailToFleishmanWritingTool.gif&quot;&gt;In an email&lt;/a&gt; to Glenn last night I explained how what we're doing will percolate up to offer choice and freedom from lock-in, not just to people who develop server software, who are mostly invisible to the average reporter, but as word processing offered choice to writers in the 1980s, to writers. (Reporters are writers.) This is an oft-told tale on this site, but now the reality is coming closer and perhaps we can tap into their dreams of freedom now that they're interested (theoretically) in what's going on in weblogs. This is where the &quot;irascible gadfly&quot; thing really stings. They're not taking us seriously, and this makes our work harder. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/12/technology/12REVI.html&quot;&gt;Markoff&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The shift in the market has created an unfamiliar paralysis among Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, many of whom have a dazed look as they watch previous bad investments crumble and try to figure out what the next hot investment will be. As a result, the area's venture-capital-to-entrepreneur ecosystem has abruptly stalled, at least temporarily.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="I was emailing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=charles+fitzgerald+microsoft&quot;&gt;Charles Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft today. I've known Charles for quite a few years, I think of him as Microsoft's PR gunslinger, and he does that job well. One of Charles' frustrations is that he has never been able to get a reporter to run this quote. &quot;You can't spell LARRY ELLISON without L, I, A, and R.&quot;  Anyway, Charles sent me the pointer to the Times article linked above, and I told him it was a great idea and would be hugely popular. It's not as if everyone doesn't already know that Office is bloated and the paper-clip is not user-friendly, but user-humiliating. Then he pointed out that Gates uses self-deprecating humor effectively in his speeches, and I agreed, referencing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://volksweb.relitech.com/funstuff/gates3.mov&quot;&gt;video with Ballmer and Gates&lt;/a&gt; in the car nodding and humming to the nerdy tune. Then I thought, wow, when we get interop in SOAP and want to market it to the press, after they've read the Markoff article (which they all did, apparently) we can do a video with Gates and Ballmer trying to stuff me into the trunk of the car, and me refusing to go.

Engelbart gave us a complete roadmap of the development of PC technology way before any of it happened. The Web &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; augment human intelligence. It can do more. We are building apps that do more for people, as TBL encourages us to do. Dreaming about the future is a good thing, it give us ideas for things we can do today."/>

As soon as I saw the piece I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/04/08/internetCriticTakesOnMicrosoft&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; to clarify.

				<outline text="It took a while for this to sink in. I was surprised that the Markoff piece essentially was a weblog piece. I wonder if the Times realizes that? So many of the weblog pieces are trivializing &quot;Lonelyhearts Club&quot; stories. Here's an example of a weblog making a difference. Clearly XML-RPC was created on the Web. And it wasn't until the work came out in the open on SOAP that the problems could start to be addressed. XML-RPC never had the problems, imho, because it only had a short private gestation. If there were fatal flaws, they would have been discovered quickly, flamed over, and probably corrected. &lt;i&gt;Sometimes it works.&lt;/i&gt;"/>

In the end, if this stuff we're doing works, there will be a new free market for software, without lock-in. If you can get behind that, we could use your help. If you think this is tilting at windmills, join a local Microsoft Haters club, they're all over the place, apparently."/>

Still to this day I have customers who tell me that a Microsoft competitor told them that 'Microsoft doesn't support XSD, they made up their own incompatible schema language.'

Originally there were three subway systems in NY, but sometime before I came online (ie before I was born) they got their interop act together so you could freely switch from one line to the other, combining features of two or three lines to create your own customized trip. I imagine that they had a mail list for their interop work, like the soapbuilders list, where the BMT guys thought the IRT guys were a bunch of bozos, but they had to work with them anyway; and the IND guys were worried about getting stuffed into the trunk."/>

We're getting suggestions on how to tweak up the BDG so that implementations that do more will be happy to talk to BDG-level implementations. I wish I could think of an analogy for this, maybe I will later. Suffice it to say this is Good News and evidence of Working Together, interop at a human level. It was always my hope that &quot;BDG&quot; would not specify a Balkan State in SOAP-land, to make that work, we need help from the broader implementations, and that help seems to be coming now. Andrew Layman even posted a message to Jake suggesting a specific fail-case and Jake is right on it. I sent Andrew an email saying &quot;I'm starting to like you again!&quot; He said &quot;I think you will respect me in the morning.&quot; Whatever that means, it sounds OK. I like to respect people, morning, noon or night. BTW, now might be a good time to mention that I've known Andrew for 14 years. We worked together at Symantec in the 80s, he lead a product team and so did I. We gave him the outlining religion. It showed up in a later release of his project management software. I think that outlining was a big win for him. And of course I didn't mind because I owned a lot of Symantec stock. Whatever. That's history. &lt;i&gt;Onward!&lt;/i&gt;"/>

				<outline text="A note to Microsoft people who read Scripting News. Reading this site allows foreign thoughts to enter your mind. If you read other sites, more foreign thoughts. This is a good philosophy, imho, because it helps make &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; ideas relevant to other people. It's easy to get sucked into the internal drama of Microsoft and think that's all that matters. That's the trap-door all gorillas eventually fall through. They get so big that no one can exist inside it &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; outside it. Eventually the world moves on. There's no precedent for it working otherwise, afaik. Also you have my gratitude for considering my point of view. "/>
				<outline text="Andrew Layman&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/1151&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the top XML guy at Microsoft is clearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/1151&quot;&gt;planting the seeds&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft's disapproval of what we're doing with the BDG. They have been so resistant to it, so fearful of it, so fear-provoking of it. I don't know what their internal plan says about the future of SOAP, and how many &quot;full&quot; implementations there will be, but I suspect the number is 1, maybe 2 (gotta keep up the appearance of it being open). I want to open the door wide, and make it an inclusive club, so there can be lots of SOAP interop, so if Microsoft plays games with the market, we have choice."/>
				<outline text="Further, I truly don't like having my positon mis-stated in such a Microsoft-serving way. "/>
				<outline text="I like SOAP. They ignore &quot;XML-RPC&quot;, that would be an easy way to get interop with lots of software, including ours, I guess that's a bug. So we say &quot;OK, let's get interop with SOAP.&quot; Then all they do is give me grief. I've not heard from a single Microsoft person a single note of gratitude and acceptance for the hard work we've done to make SOAP understandable."/>
				<outline text="I have spoken with some ex-Microsoft people to get their perspective on how Microsoft parses this situation, and they have no doubt that world domination is the goal. Please understand that I am as opposed to that as Andrew is opposed to anything less than &quot;full&quot; implementations, and I will do everything in my power to prevent that from happening. That was my &quot;contract&quot; with SOAP, that it would open up the networking interfaces from now on. &quot;Impossible to implement&quot; is not open, and neither is &quot;Whatever Andrew says.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, assuming the best of Microsoft, they're simply surprised, and perhaps like Apple's reaction to the Web in 1993, they truly don't like what we're doing. Well, imagine how surprised I was to find out that HailStorm is a closed box. Surprise is fun. Accept it, and if you want to, challenge it, but do it in a way that befits the stature of your company. You can handle something a little different from what you planned. If you can't you have no business being in the software business, as Bill Gates always reminds us. So what if there are thirty interoperating SOAP 1.1 stacks. Why assume that Microsoft's engineers can't produce software that has value, even when there's competition?"/>
				<outline text="If you want &quot;full&quot; implementations I think your best strategy is to work hard to make the BDG-level implementations roaring successes, make the implementors feel like kings and queens, and show them how much you appreciate what they've done to help make SOAP a success. Gush with praise, instead of threatening to condemn. Act like a representative of a truly great company. And please include UserLand in that, we have worked hard on this and deserve success."/>
				<outline text="Anyway this is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=colossal&quot;&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt; waste of my time, and I don't appreciate it. Being put on the defensive, constantly, by a company with so many resources, it's just not fair. What did I do that was so terrible? I'm trying to bring more developers, including UserLand, to SOAP."/>

					<outline text="Even though there's confusion, we're still shipping SOAP apps, the things that others call Web Services. You gotta know we were ready for this. For example, we shipped a SOAP interface for MailToTheFuture over the weekend. The work was mostly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/mailToTheFuture&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/mailToTheFuture&quot;&gt;table of glue scripts&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier and Radio scripters. All we had to do to implement the SOAP interface was put an address to the table of XML-RPC handlers in user.soap.rpcHandlers. One line of code turned our XML-RPC support into SOAP support."/>
					<outline text="Now, the next SOAP app is called xmlStorageSystem. It's like HailStorm with one key difference. Instead of being private, the content you store is public. It's publishing. All our interfaces will be publicly documented and clonable. This is not a business model. "/>
					<outline text="And like the MTTF interfaces, the hard work is already done. The code for xmlStorageSystem is the back-end of an already-deployed Radio feature called &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/howUpstreamingWorks&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;. I'm simplifying the interfaces, writing docs, testing, etc. The delivery will be in the same form as MTTF release -- docs for non-UserLand developers, and a glue table for people who work in our environment."/>
					<outline text="BTW, what falls out of this, almost for free, is a low-tech SOAP-based pub-sub system, also implemented and documented. There's no time like now to move, before the BigCo moves, let's get some software deployed, let the boostrap proceed to the next step, before the FUD gets too heavy."/>

				<outline text="Good morning &quot;BDG&quot; fans!">
					<outline text="It's still not frozen. Microsoft has not reviewed the spec, as far as we know, in any official capacity. We want confirmation that the subset the BDG defines will work with Microsoft's SOAP implementations. It spooks me that they will not say one way or the other. I remember the XML support in Word, useless as a basis for interop, but the hopes were there anyway, prior to its release. I'm concerned that we're pouring effort down a bottomless hole, and that's gotta stop sometime, and if it's not going to yield interop with MS products, we should stop now. What a shame it would be to have wasted so much effort only to find out that there was never any hope of interop. It could happen. "/>
					<outline text="On the other hand, after a rocky start the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders&quot;&gt;soapbuilders&lt;/a&gt; community has been wonderful to work with. We're getting to know each other, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/bdg#strategiesgoals&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; seem to match. "/>
