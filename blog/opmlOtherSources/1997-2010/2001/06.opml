This should not be happening. My belief is that the flow of new user-oriented networking software has been disrupted, that's why it's slowing down. We've stopped coming up with new things for the users to do with networks. There are two reasons for this, imho. The VCs have drawn the wrong conclusions about the causes for the dotcom bust. They weren't investing in technology, they were starting publishing companies and retail outlets. This is not the proper role for technology investors. The other reason is that under the guise of &quot;innovation&quot; Microsoft has scared off all its competition.

					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/uncleSamWeWon.gif&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; width=&quot;189&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;I want to share a little story. I know Connie Guglielmo through her husband John Leddy, who like Brad Pettit and Steve Zellers, worked at Symantec after I left, for the part of Symantec that I founded. When I first read her wonderful Smart Tags &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/columns/0,4164,2772297,00.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; I was fooled and thought I was reading an accident that revealed that her publisher had less than perfect integrity. I sent her an email. She responded, and we went back and forth a few times. At the end of the exchange, glowing from finding a kindred spirit from my past, getting help from a reporter of high integrity, I said &quot;Maybe we've found something to believe in.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Even during the dotcom boom, while cynical carpetbaggers swooped in and turned the Web into a no-integrity tangle of &quot;business models,&quot; we had something to believe in -- ourselves and each other. Now we got a chance to find out who &quot;each other&quot; are, this issue bonded people at all kinds of publications, from the Wall Street Journal and San Jose Mercury News, to ZDNet and News.Com, and Manila and Blogger; and probably included some people at Microsoft, although it's unlikely we'll ever know who they are. "/>
					<outline text="Yet, as with the CDA nightmare, which was overturned almost exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnewsarchive.userland.com/1997/06/26&quot;&gt;four years ago&lt;/a&gt;, one editorial voice, conspicuously, did not speak -- The NY Times. We waited, both times, for them to stand for the value of free expression, and both times were disappointed. I can forgive Microsoft, and do; but I can't overlook such an obvious omission. Why didn't they stand up for the integrity of the Web?"/>

					<outline text="O'Reilly's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progxmlrpc/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC book&lt;/a&gt; is now shipping. &quot;XML-RPC, a simple yet powerful system built on XML and HTTP, lets developers connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss. Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to ASP applications, and so on. With XML-RPC, developers can provide access to functionality without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create web services.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Gotta complaint though. Looking in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progxmlrpc/inx.html&quot;&gt;index&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't find UserLand, Frontier, or me. The only mention of Frontier is the confusing name given to the first Perl XML-RPC module. For the record, UserLand was the first to implement XML-RPC, in Frontier. (Radio also has full support.)"/>
					<outline text="When I reviewed the first draft of the book, I found that the authors had &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; left us out of the story. When I saw this I rushed to write the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1726&quot;&gt;foreword&lt;/a&gt; to the book. At least the publishing people at O'Reilly had the foresight to make the offer."/>
					<outline text="So I know I'm helping them sell their book, and I hope it's a big success, and maybe they'll help us get the next one off the ground. I don't think we should have to do anything to keep from being written out of technologies we create. We're running a business here too, as O'Reilly is -- and we help them sell books, it seems fair they would help the pioneering product that made XML-RPC possible. That's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=reciprocate&quot;&gt;reciprocation&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a key part of the Web. To O'Reilly it's time for a &quot;brand new day.&quot; What do you say? "/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1152&quot;&gt;Here's an idea&lt;/a&gt; we've been incubating for six years. In Frontier, if you put a name in double-quotes that it knows, it does a replacement. This &lt;i&gt;glossary&lt;/i&gt; is hierarchic, so it loops out levels until it hits the root, so you can over-ride global definitions locally. A one-level version of this glossary is the Manila &lt;a href=&quot;http://manilanewbies.userland.com/stories/storyReader$346&quot;&gt;shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; feature. It all happens in the CMS, on the server, not in the browser, fully under the control of the writers. Now that Microsoft has raised the issue, it makes sense perhaps to formalize a proposal for developers of CMS's to do distributed glossaries. This is something we've been working on steadily too. Our global glossary is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://glossary.userland.com/&quot;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt;, and Radio 7.0 users automatically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/readGlobalShortcutsSample.gif&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; Radio's glossary every night to get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/glossary.xml&quot;&gt;latest changes&lt;/a&gt;, via XML of course.

But I'm a writer, and I love it! I've never heard a prose writer complain about this, just script writers. If you quote something that isn't in the glossary, the renderer leaves it alone. Sometimes it enables text that I wasn't expecting it to. I usually chuckle, and then put a backslash before the double-quote, which turns rendering off for the term. But often it surprises me by doing exactly the right thing. I laugh even louder when this happens!&quot;" created="Fri, 22 Jun 2001 05:22:22 GMT" type="outline"/>

Be sure to read it if you're interested in integrity and web-writing. In several email exchanges this morning I realized that it's necessary to have integrity in software to make integrity in web-writing possible.

My grandfather sent me extra money when I was starting my first company and in a deep financial hole. My parents didn't know about it. (Now they do, happy Father's Day!) My mom was worried I'd turn into a bum. (Like my uncles and her uncle, an eclectic but respected German &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altx.com/ebr/reviews/rev7/r7hei.htm&quot;&gt;novelist&lt;/a&gt;, who my grandmother thought was a bum.) Both my grandfathers had a vision for the family, and I was the one starting a business, so they pitched in and helped. Both of them were business guys. So while I have a funny last name (yeah I know, it's been my last name all my life) saying that Evan is Winerizing is good news for Evan. Why not? One thing us Winers have in common is good ideas. If I do say so myself. And some kind of an idea about business." created="Sat, 16 Jun 2001 05:05:41 GMT" type="outline"/>

Weblogs.Com is a free service, of course, done with love for the Weblog community. Oy, these people treat us like we're total slime. Whatever.

				<outline text="A couple of notes to the anti-abortion people who send me emails. It's a complicated issue because another person is involved, a woman. We know that the mother is a person. It's a matter of philosophy whether a fetus is. For some people there is a clear answer to this conundrum, for others, like me and many others, there is not. When in doubt, my philosophy says, give the power to decide to the individual. I'm not happy with this, in some kind of perfect world we'd never have to answer this question. Further, I believe that human population growth is the core problem to the survivability of the planet. And where the heck do you draw the line. Is sperm a life that must be protected too? The other notable thing about this discussion is the inability of the anti-abortion people to discuss with respect. Their emails are often personally insulting." created="Tue, 12 Jun 2001 05:09:21 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="A common form of pushback goes like this. &quot;If you're opposed to capital punishment you must be anti-abortion.&quot; I assume the correspondents know that it's likely that I &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; oppose abortion, and this is a way of pointing out a contradiction in my values.

It also reveals an apparent contradiction in &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; values, assuming they are anti-abortion and pro-death penalty (they never say so I'm left guessing). That's why statements about yourself are more interesting than statements about other people. The extra level of indirectness masks lessons one can learn about oneself.

				<outline text="State governments in the US execute people almost every week, but every so often a high profile execution comes up and we re-focus on the issue, as a country.

Killing people in the name of justice is wrong. We &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; kill innocent people. A black man is more likely to be executed than a white man. Almost all the people executed are men. As a citizen of the country that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://a799.ms.akamai.net/3/799/388/99c9597f12ec57/www.msnbc.com/news/1045961.gif&quot;&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/584658.asp?0dm=C22HN&quot;&gt;McVeigh&lt;/a&gt;, I am responsible for his death. That's cruel and unusual punishment, for me, and attacks my core belief of what it means to be human. Killing another person, for whatever reason, is not the domain of a civilized society.

				<outline text="&lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Technological advances cannot and should not be stopped, slowed, or even discouraged, but an invention such as Smart Tags should not be in the hands of a for-profit enterprise.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;If this feature had not come from Microsoft, I think we would all be cheering. &quot;Wow that's powerful,&quot; we'd say. The problem is we know Microsoft in many ways better than the people who work there, who may be good people, but they seem to put the blinders on when it comes to thinking about the people who &lt;i&gt;run Microsoft.&lt;/i&gt; They don't create things, they own things.

It seems there were a lot of Softies who stood up for the independence of the Web but Bill decided to go the other way and fully integrate the Web into Microsoft's product line.

Is a monopoly required to play by different rules than a company with competitors? We don't have any real choice, the vast majority of people who read our content read it through Microsoft's browser.

				<outline text="Thoughts for musicians to consider. Does linking in music mean anything? The rush last year with Napster raised that question, but things were moving too fast back then to figure how to phrase it. Imho, music belongs on the Web, so, like writing, it can integrate with other music. Just like writers and software developers, musicians share themes with each other. I heard an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elvis-costello.com/homepage/&quot;&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt; where he talked about musicians that influence him. He's the right guy to talk about it since he's such a great synthesizer of different practices. Now what if technology could support that, where each song would link back to those that it refers to? Before writing got networked, it was pretty awkward to do this. But look at the number of off-site links on this page for a clue of how networking has changed writing. It can and will do the same for music." created="Wed, 06 Jun 2001 05:20:17 GMT" type="outline"/>
