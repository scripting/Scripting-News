					<outline text="Key quote from yesterday. &quot;I think I've offered [Microsoft] a sweet deal, a way to enable independent and open source developers to work to make Dot-Net an even greater success than it would be if it were a closed bathtub. Dead developers don't write code, and some of us would rather die that work in a Microsoft environment. (No disrespect to their software, but the price in freedom is too high.)&quot;"/>
					<outline text="There may come a day when engineers leave Microsoft to get people to use their software, because the environment is so polluted by Microsoft's various attempts to suck all developers in. Been around the block too many times. I said no to Sun, and I said no to Microsoft. I am an independent developer. I don't mind competition. But I refuse to be assimilated. Not a joke."/>
					<outline text="I like low-tech understandable interop. I don't like vague and complicated specs that have wild cards and aren't frozen. I want to offer my users choice. If they don't like our software, it's easy to switch to something else. (I want choice too, some of our apps are better implemented in other environments.) The only way to get rid of lock-in is to make it &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; to be compatible. That's why we did &quot;BDG&quot;, because the full SOAP spec is so damned hard to implement it will probably only be implemented by Microsoft. "/>
					<outline text="That's where the assimilation comes in. If the only environment that works with all the others is Microsoft's we're all fucked, including Microsoft. Not that it's my job to worry about Microsoft, it's not, but I'm willing to sell them (if only they were willing to sell me)."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/751&quot;&gt;On the soapbuilder list&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;I work so openly, the ideas just must be strange. How could I be willing to give them something for free without somehow poisoning them?&quot;"/>

				<outline text="What a day. The phone is ringing off the hook. Swamped with email. More reasons for a slim SOAP, deploying in Flash and embedded systems. Keep the downloads small. Run with less memory. These aren't my major concerns, I want to lower the barrier to entry so my friends can play in the SOAP tub without fear. &quot;BDG&quot; struck a nerve. It's a change, but a lot of people were thinking the same thing, either afraid or unable to say it publicly. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=sliver&quot;&gt;sliver&lt;/a&gt; of SOAP is enough, for now, for many." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="But before I claim victory, I still want to get Microsoft on board. I had an offlist politics-only discussion with Marshall Goldberg, the funny DeKovenish diplomat at Microsoft. &quot;We can get back on track quickly,&quot; I said. Not sure if he agreed or disagreed, but he was friendly about it." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Last night we overhauled our SOAP 1.1 &lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.soapware.org&quot;&gt;validator&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/538&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a heads-up at 8:20PM, by 9PM the validator was &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/547&quot;&gt;running again&lt;/a&gt;. Simon Fell's 4s4c &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/592&quot;&gt;validated&lt;/a&gt; right away, as did Fredrik Lundh's Python &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/573&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; and Paul Kulchenko's &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/582&quot;&gt;SOAP::Lite for Perl&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to tweak the tests today, I expect to break Fredrik's code right away, unless he's &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; fast. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="At 9AM we were scheduled to close discussion on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap11&quot;&gt;Busy Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, but we pushed it back another 24 hours to get more chance for bug-fixes and buy-in. The new drop-dead date for pushback is 9AM Saturday Pacific. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="If you're going to implement this subset of SOAP please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1446&quot;&gt;post a note&lt;/a&gt; on the DG or send me a private email. (I've already gotten four private emails from important implementations pledging support for the BDG. Please, if at all possible, make your statement publicly, so everyone who's sitting on the fence can see the rapid support that's developing for the BDG.)" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1504&quot;&gt;Hannes Wallnöfer&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'm working on a SOAP library for Java. I'm doing this based on the Helma XML-RPC library for Java I wrote, using the BDG as a guide.&quot;" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="What is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.identics.com/&quot;&gt;identics.com&lt;/a&gt;?" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="So far I've explicitly asked for support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/618&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/480&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. The offer is open to everyone, of course, by its nature. I wanted to specifically ask for the help of Python because we have a long history of excellent collaboration with Fredrik and Zope, and our languages are so close, as are our philosophies. It's a no-brainer. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I explicitly invited Microsoft because they're The Main Gorilla in this space. I think I've offered them a sweet deal, a way to enable independent and open source developers to work to make Dot-Net an even greater success than it would be if it were a closed bathtub. Dead developers don't write code, and some of us would rather die that work in a Microsoft environment. (No disrespect to their software, but the price in freedom is too high.) " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="There's no poison pill here for Microsoft, unless swallowing your pride and letting an independent developer have &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; influence on his destiny is too high a price. This is an acid test for MS. If they can't handle well-thought-out pushback from me, the co-inventor of the technology they're using to dominate the world, you gotta figure they won't take pushback from anyone." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I also asked Microsoft for support because I, however unwisely, have a soft spot in my heart for the company and for Bill. I have a long relationship with Microsoft dating back to 1981. Bill helped me get going on the Internet, with his response to one of the very first DaveNets. He's often been willing to push back to me, and I appreciate that. That's what I call R-E-S-P-E-C-T. To Bill, it's time to ante up again, in the only way that matters. Let's have our software work together, without either of us swallowing a poison pill. That's true power. This may be a detour for your guys, but understand it's a detour for us too. We were ready with this stuff three years ago. " type="outline"/>

				<outline text="It's taking time to get used to thinking and communicating outside the firewall. We rely on the comfort of rules imposed by old technology while we learn how to work with the new. It happens in software too. I have to make the browser feel to me like a development environment I'm used to. I have to make procedure calls work over the Internet so I can distribute my applications, using power that's new to me. However I never had to learn how to &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; outside the firewall, that's the only kind of writing I've done, except for one or two pieces I've written for Steve Gillmor. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Perhaps this was the disconnect I had with Hotwired when I used to write for them. They were so set on me doing a weekly column that was turned in 5 days early so they could run it through their process. I hated that. By the time the article ran I'd have already moved on. All of a sudden I'd be getting email on something I was interested in 5 days ago. Oy. I wasn't there anymore. (Is there an echo in here?)" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="We also missed a scoop that way. I had Steve Wozniak on the record criticizing Spindler's Apple. At the time this was newsworthy, and my story which had appeared on my personal website days before it appeared on Wired, had been picked up by the Examiner and ran on page 1 of their business section. Our pub was web-only. It should have been on &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; front page minutes after I had the quote, instead of the days it took to run it through the normal cycle. Don't get me wrong, Hotwired was a fantastic pub for its day. But you can see how weird that all looks now, 6.5 years later." type="outline"/>

They would already have deployed Web services. Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference, but why, in retrospect, not have given it a try?

He says that Microsoft's SOAP implementations &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; do RPC. He agrees that RPC will be the basis for validation. This is good. On the other hand, if it requires agreement with a representative of Microsoft to decide what interop means, then SOAP is not an Internet standard, it's a way to interop with Microsoft. To my fellow developers, please let's work together. It's the only way our work will be meaningful, imho. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/interopathonPlan&quot;&gt;Interopathon&lt;/a&gt; plan, I called for a lot of things we seem to agree on. Public servers, hierarchic pairing of developers to create interop, and a conclusion to the process where we can say definitively that we all interop.

It's the zig to Blogger's centralized zag. (Or the blig to its blog?) As Blogger has grown, it's climbing a scaling wall, and the performance has suffered, much as the performance of Weblogs.Com has suffered as it has grown. So we built a blogging tool that runs on your desktop. It's more trouble to set up and keep running, for sure, but the bet we've made is that it's worth it, to at least some people who blog, for the reliability and performance it adds.

It's kind of the inverse of HailStorm, instead of the data moving to the cloud it moves to the desktop. From there, you can write software that converts it to other formats. One of my new friends at Microsoft, Keith Ballinger, suggested moving to eBooks. You could write a script that downloads a Manila site every night and builds an eBook and uploads it.

				<outline text="There clearly is no way Microsoft is going to be able to bundle the OS with their cloud without giving users choice. The startup screen must allow you to easily switch back-ends. And further, there must be a way for a user to get all their data on their local system in easy-to-parse-XML, so it's easy if you for some reason (as silly as it may seem) want to switch to another service. What Microsoft is proposing is crude and unfair, and unstatesmanlike and not open, and further is bad computing practice. Plus there's more I can't tell you (dammit) because of the NDA. Remember Steve Jobs' machine with no floppy drive? Well I think you need Bill's approval to ship software that runs against the cloud. I admit I'm fuzzy on this." type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I then realized it's even worse than it appears. The machine that runs the mail sender doesn't actually send the mail. It XML-RPC's the message body and the list of recipients to a third machine which specializes in batch mail sending. All our machines route through that app to get onto the SMTP network. Behind our firewall it's all XML-RPC. This makes it easy to reconfigure mail sending, and there's a single exit point for logging email that flows out of our cloud."/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1350&quot;&gt;First, he's written&lt;/a&gt; up a problem we've encountered with WSDL.

					<outline text="Second, he's written &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1355&quot;&gt;sample scripts&lt;/a&gt; that allow a workstation to emulate Radio's &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/howToUseRadioWithManila&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; in editing a Manila site. We'd like to see two specific projects come from this. An editor that runs on Unix, perhaps emacs or vi, that through Apache, allows a user to create and edit stories and update the home page of a Manila site in the same natural way that Radio works with Manila. The other project is to write a .NET application that allows the CLR to be a great editor for Manila text in the same way. Do they have text editing tools in .NET? Would you like to use them to edit a Manila site? This is the next wire in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/11/30/bootstrapping&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; process that leads to interop. "/>

					<outline text="All you'll have to do is emulate the functionality in other scripting environments. Then we'll have a very important kind of interop, between writers on all these platforms.

					<outline text="When &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com&quot;&gt;Garret Vreeland&lt;/a&gt; moved his site he wrote an essay about how he was tired of living on the web to please other people. I don't know where that essay went, but the thought remained. It's the same feeling that a wife uses when divorcing a husband, or a husband divorcing a wife. But of course on the Net, as long I just express my own ideas, so what if I don't please some people? Some people are darned difficult to please! And we're not married so I don't have to go to court to get a divorce. Happiness. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I have a little experiment that I'd like to suggest to people who have close friends who like to explore human nature. Go for a walk, a relatively long one, with your friend. At the outset, suggest playing a game. &quot;I'd like to ask you, sometime during this walk, why you said or did something. It may not seem significant to you, but I'd like you to answer truthfully. I will ask the question when I am sure I know the reason why you did what I saw you do, or heard you say what you said. The only reason I'm going to ask you why is to learn about myself. To find out if I'm truly omniscient or if I am projecting my own movie onto your life.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Now, my bet is that you'll learn a tremendous amount about yourself when you do this. Your friend will say &quot;I am doing this because xxx,&quot; and you thought it was yyy. Or maybe your friend won't even know that he or she actually did anything."/>
					<outline text="Such an experiment can only lead to good things. You'll learn the value in asking instead of assuming you know. What makes me think of this? A conversation with a friend a few weeks ago where she commented on something I did, in fairly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=accusatorial&quot;&gt;accusatorial&lt;/a&gt; way, but not terribly so, because it left room for me to explain. &quot;I didn't do that to hurt your feelings,&quot; I said. I wasn't even thinking about her when I did it. I know this is true, because I didn't know she was involved in what I was talking about. But my friend was assuming it was about her. It was not."/>
					<outline text="Another little story. Yesterday I was on my daily walk. I carry an orange ball with me sometimes, and throw it ahead of me, sometimes it lands in the bushes and I have to go digging around to find it. A car passed me as I was walking off the road into the bushes to look for my orange ball. &quot;He must think I'm getting out of his way,&quot; my movie said to me. &quot;But the joke's on him (a la Ole) I'm just going to get my orange ball.&quot; What a conversation. For all I know it was a woman driving the car, and perhaps she didn't even see me, or she was telling her kids to shut up, or driving her mother to the hospital and thinking about how she was going to pay the bills."/>

				<outline text="I'm working on something speculative. Gotta do that every once in a while to keep the gears oiled. My goal is to come up with a simple to implement groupware application that can be coded in any SOAP-aware environment, and uses its object serialization power. The application is inspired by The Hong Brothers, Tony and James. AmIHotOrNot in a hierarchy of users and workgroups and groups of workgroups, an Internet-based pyramid scheme. In the bootstrapping sense, the first cable across a body of water. So light that a small bird could lift it. No guarantee it'll ship, that's how speculative projects go.

They volunteer answers even for questions they haven't been asked.&quot; So much to say about this. I talked with Sheila for an hour yesterday. It's true that a lot of men are totally self-absorbed, and not much fun to hang out with. It's the rare person, of either gender, who has an interest in what's going on inside other people. Most of us act like we're the whole universe. That's not fun (because it's so not true). When people insert themselves in an unwelcome way in your life, what do you do about it? There's not much you can do, except turn in another direction and welcome more positive attitudes. With 9 billion people on the planet, you can't be friends with everyone, you can really only be friends with about 5-20 people depending on how close you want to get. &lt;i&gt;Choose your friends&lt;/i&gt; where there's fun and respect, breathe deeply, and keep on truckin." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Another way of looking at the same thing. On any given day of the week, there's always someone who is angry with me, has an issue with me, wants me to stop doing something (I might not even be doing it), or is otherwise having an emotional outburst that for some reason involves me, in their mind. If I always stopped and dealt with each one, I would never have any time to live my life, and work out &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; issues, with other people, who may not happen to be this person. In other words sometimes a neighborhood kid comes knocking at the door to see if Dave can come out to play, and sometimes the answer is sorry, he's busy now." type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Next week I'm going to the Microsoft Hailstorm event. I don't know what it's about, and it's a non-disclosure event, so I won't be able to tell you until they announce it publicly. But I haven't signed the NDA yet, so I can speculate. First, I like the name Hailstorm. It's aggressive. I wonder whose head the hail is supposed to fall on. Hail is annoying, but rarely deadly. That's good. I'm always up for a good hailstorm. Why not. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="OK, when Sun was getting ready to announce their answer to Dot-Net I said that either it was SOAP or it was irrelevant. Same with Hailstorm. Further, it's got to be about instant messaging. Therefore I conclude it's a SOAP interface for instant messaging. That's kind of what Jeremie and I talked about yesterday. So we can have an insurance policy, possibly a common API, and we (developers) get choice and can pass that on to users and feel good about doing the right thing. Maybe we should call our project Hail Harvester?" type="outline"/>

I promised it would it be interesting and fun and simple. Well, today is that day. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Radio is shipping. It's not beta anymore. When you boot it up it'll read a set of default channels and present you with a rush of news. A nice toolbar at the top. Leave it running. Every hour on the hour it'll do another scan. Read the news, route it to your blog. Check out the hotlist, see what everyone else is reading. Click a checkbox to subscribe to any channel. When you see a white-on-orange XML button on the Web, get the URL it links to and add it to your subscription list (only if it's RSS of course). " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Radio is also a blogging tool, it's got all the easy-to use-features a blogger would want and the data is on &lt;i&gt;your computer.&lt;/i&gt; Create your own RSS channels. Route stories by category so people in your organization can follow the news that you point them to. The publishing tools are in your hands so you can get the news where it needs to go. There's so much more to say. And you can be sure I'll say it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="You can put the Radio coffee mug on your UserLand-hosted Manila site with \&quot;radioCoffeeMug\&quot;. (Include the quotes.)" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Tip for Radio newbies. If you want your channel choices to be reflected in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/&quot;&gt;Top 100&lt;/a&gt;, you must turn on &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/howupstreamingworks&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Another nice Radio feature I use all the time is &lt;i&gt;Weblogs.Com on the Desktop.&lt;/i&gt; It's linked into the Tools page. Every hour at 15 after the hour it gets the changes from Weblogs.Com (in XML of course) and presents them (in HTML of course). Why is this better than just using Weblogs.Com? Well, it's a lot faster, for one thing. Maybe that's the only thing. Well, that's a good one. You can grow old waiting for our server to render the list through your favorites (and everyone else's). Radio is fast. Because you're the only person it's serving. This is one of the key advantages of &lt;i&gt;decentralization.&lt;/i&gt;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Now, perhaps the best feature for the geeks is that you get the source code for the desktop website in Radio. And there are lots of places you can customize, or if you want, do you own desktop website in Radio and teach us how this stuff really works. There's XML-RPC, SOAP, HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP, OPML, RSS, you name it we got it, all in an easy scripting enviornment with an outliner-based script editor. The other guys are years behind. Radio is a developer's friend, geeks can have fun and please do. (Did I mention it's got a content management system too? It does.)" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="And who ever heard of a Web server with a built-in text editor and object database? We did. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Now business details. This release of Radio is free. It works. When we come out with 7.0.1 we'll have a for-pay version. It will also be able to be a workgroup server. The Radio we're shipping now is limited to 5 simultaneous net connections. This works really well for a personal server. However if you want others to use your copy of Radio we'll make a version that can do that, and that version will be for-pay-only -- still haven't decided on the price. This will be our long-term sustainable business model. If you like Radio and want us to hire more programmers to implement the features you want, faster, dig in and find the money, but not yet. Let's build a big base of users first." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Some have asked What About Frontier? Oh yes, we have major new stuff in Frontier 7, that's next on the plate. No change in price. Frontier is the server for huge numbers of Manila sites. Radio is a desktop tool. We've been talking about the &quot;workstation product&quot; for a few years. That's Radio. It's for people. Frontier is for big groups of people. They work together well, by design. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="And I'd like to extend a big hearty Welcome Back to people who are using free versions of Frontier on Mac OS from 1998 or earlier. We've been working really hard, adding features and fixing bugs, it's worth moving up to Radio. It's a real 7.0. (Isn't that confusing!) " type="outline"/>

				<outline text="The cool thing about my life is that I get to meet such smart people, and lots of the thanks for that goes to the Web. When I was interviewed for the Newsweek &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/535681.asp&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about weblogs a couple of weeks ago Deborah Branscum asked what practical use weblogs serve. Good question. I told her that there was no way XML-RPC and probably SOAP could have happened without weblogs. Community projects require good communication, and the Internet, if it does anything, is an unprecedented communication enabler. Mail lists are fine, but they can easily get locked up and frozen, unable to move. Weblogs are different, it's possible on a weblog to speak and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; give equal weight to every point of view. This begets more weblogs, giving people choices, they gravitate to the places that make sense for them. With this, movement can happen. Ask a question, get an answer, move on, ask another. After a few years, the results are visible." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Perhaps I got to the bottom of the controversy over WSDL. SOAP w/o an IDL is &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/nowaythispageexists.xml&quot;&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/a&gt; all over again. You call a procedure and it's not there or its interface changed and your script fails. What does an IDL do to prevent such an outage, or to help you debug an outage that a thoughtfully worded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/notFoundScriptError.gif&quot;&gt;error message&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't? Of course in this debate I'm taking the side of linkrot. It's our friend, it makes this stuff implementable, and keeps the gorillas from swamping and crushing The Little Folk." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Speaking of thoughtfully worded error messages, at UserLand we have a template for messages, which we always (Murphy-willing) follow. It goes like this. &lt;i&gt;Can't xxx because yyy.&lt;/i&gt; The first part is important because the user must be told what the software was trying to do when it failed. When there's an error, part of the &quot;user model,&quot; like it or not, is the idea that each user operation is decomposed into thousands or millions of &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/07/14/xmlRpcForNewbies&quot;&gt;procedure calls&lt;/a&gt;, any one of which could fail. So the xxx part of the message gives you a clue which one of those internal procedures is the one that couldn't do its thing. The yyy part is supposed to give you a clue how to cure the ill and get on with your life. So a good error message includes both bits of information. By having a default structure for the message, it saves the programmer from having to be creative, in English, while he or she is being creative, in code. And it causes the programmer to worry about the poor users, how will they know what went wrong?" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="BTW, it's totally true, theoretically, that every procedure could fail, but does this mean that programmers must check every operation to see if it worked? No. But I've seen people try. The code goes like this.&lt;pre&gt;   x = y + 5&lt;br&gt;   if x != (y + 5)&lt;br&gt;      scriptError (&quot;Can't xxx because yyy.&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;Well, that's ridiculous. If the CPU isn't working your test isn't going to work either. And the user probably has a few other clues to this, like the OS doesn't boot up." type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Heads-up on the shipment of Radio. I think we're there. It's not perfect, there are bugs, but we believe that it will install and start reading news on almost everyone's system, Murphy-willing. From there it's quite stable. I've been using it without a hitch for over a month. I'm starting to use it in new ways, which is a sign that we're out of the bleeding-edge zone. It's still for technically savvy people, but you don't have to understand its innards to get the benefit. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="To be comfortable with Radio, you should have a basic understanding of how the Internet works.

				<outline text="With this release we're going to redefine what we do at UserLand. I feel we now have a complete platform. We have hit the top of the tree we started to climb in 1996. Sure, we'll add more ornaments, but our most important work will be grooming, fixing bugs, improving performance and docs. With the focus on desktop websites, and the growth of SOAP and XML-RPC, the position of Radio is clear now -- it's our outpost on the desktop in the new distributed network that's growing so quickly. This is a good strategy because we're leading in this area. The product fits our role in the industry, after years of patient waiting and developing, I think we're now in our &quot;zone&quot;. We have the best application development platform for SOAP and XML-RPC. It's here now, ready for developers. " type="outline"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macedition.com/op/op_porruka_20010305.shtml&quot;&gt;MacEdition mourns&lt;/a&gt; the passing of MacWEEK. It makes my skin tingle to remember how much I used to look forward to the weekly dose of MacWEEK in the late 80s and early 90s. Back then we called it the &quot;sweaty palms&quot; phenomenon. In its heyday PC WEEK was the same way. When it arrived everything stopped, and I read every damned article. I wonder why. The Mac was good then. At breakfast yesterday with Chris Gulker, a former Apple person, he pointed out that betw 1990 and 1995 they didn't ship a new Mac OS. What were the thousand engineers working on? Cloning Photoshop and Quark. Oy gevilt. Maybe that's why the excitement passed. Maybe it's because immediately after shipping System 7, Apple started promoting Pink. Maybe it's because the developers didn't hang together. Maybe it's because the users didn't support the developers. Maybe it's because Apple resisted the Web? Maybe there's no reason, maybe all good things pass. MacWEEK sure was a good thing. BTW, the first MacWEEK editor was Jon Littman. Stephen Beale was the last." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulsrandomwalk.editthispage.com/2001/03/06&quot;&gt;Paul Snively&lt;/a&gt; takes issue with the idea that Apple started promoting Pink shortly after System 7 shipped. I think basically what happened is that Sculley talked about it with a bunch of reporters, and that made headlines, and created a permanent issue for Apple. Pink is late, the stories would say for years to come. He was the CEO at the time and had that kind of power. One of the funny things about Apple is that the lower-level people never accepted the authority of the execs, so if Sculley said something they didn't have to acknowledge it. It was a funny company, because I don't think the execs ever accepted the workers' point of view. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, the disconnect made Apple a strange company to deal with. No one was in charge, so silly projects like cloning Quark and Photoshop could get staffed and when JLG wanted a scripting language for the Mac in 1988, he had to go on a press tour, perhaps to prove to his people someone else cared about what he thought. My theory on the cause for the disconnect was the lurking shadow of Steve Jobs, no one took these &quot;new&quot; guys seriously (Sculley, Spindler, Amelio, so many weird un-Apple-like people showed up at the top). Apple people bought the Legend Of Steve, and since he wasn't there at the time, every one of them had a chance to be The New Steve. Lots of very opinionated people, just like Microsoft, but unlike Microsoft, they didn't seek outside opinions. And look at how they slip in new versions of the OS without killing old ones. It's not that hard. Hey, Sculley didn't know jack about software. I think we all agree on &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;" type="outline"/>

I don't think they have a clue that their argument isn't with the users, it's with the past. The Internet is here. All their users have it. It's like trying to fight a war after the technology of war has changed. They always plan to re-fight the last war. It doesn't end up working out that way." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="BTW, since Microsoft is rushing Office XP to market, it's fair to assume that it doesn't have any meaningful SOAP 1.1 support. Why? Because we are still working on interop. They may &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; they have SOAP support, but it would be like the XML support the previous version of Word had. So deeply Microsoft-like as to be irrelevant. Has anyone done any development on Word's XML support? I've never heard of anyone doing it. Maybe I missed something. It was so bizarre, perhaps it was in some way XML. But interop is the reason for XML. So if you don't interop, why bother?" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I've started working on ALIDL, an acronym for A Little IDL. I'm designing it for both XML-RPC and SOAP. Writing the docs first. It's scripting-centered. It's becoming clear to me that there are at least two philosophies to net programming. The scripting approach depends on loose coupling and easy coercion between types. Further, when I return a &lt;struct&gt; I don't want to fully specify it. I can't generate a struct spec by parsing the handler's source code, it would have to be hand-coded. Further we generate structs with variable complexity. I doubt if you could define a schema for it, and if you could I can't imagine what use it would be. Better to just call the handler and see what it returns. It's possible (I don't know) that there's no way to browse structs in other environments. Depending on the ability to do that might be a Frontierism. Anyway, like the XML-RPC process, we'll learn about other environments. The goal is to find out if it's possible to have an IDL that works for many if not all scripting environments. I think the key to success is to keep it realllly simple." type="outline"/>

I think these people whoever they are, don't have a clue how Web apps are deployed. I drop a script in a folder basically and call it. If I want someone else to call it I write a page of docs. If I want to remember why I did it, I put comments in the code, and if I want other people to understand why I did it, I put those comments in the docs. It's work, but I understand that kind of work. I have no idea what these folks are up to. Now it could be just the workflow stuff I wrote about last weekend, if you yell at me, that's OK, but be sure to explain why anyone would want to take the time to do WSDL and where can I go to find out what the heck it is.

					<outline text="I had an interesting conversation with a couple of Gnutella developers at the P2P conf in Feb. They like XML-RPC and could see the difference between it and the broader SOAP protocol. I told them the story of how it forked from SOAP in 1998. This is something I couldn't talk about publicly at the time, because Microsoft's involvement was up to them to announce. The Gnutella guys said it was a good thing I did the fork at the time when the ideas were so simple, before it went through the political process inside Microsoft. Well, something like that is happening again. When it's done, I hope Microsoft and the other big companies live up to the spirit of yesterday's piece. Through no fault of any single person, the natural way to proceed at a big companies is not necessarily the open way. "/>
					<outline text="I don't want to scare anyone but it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a little scary, SOAP is in what we call a &quot;critical section&quot; in programming, what happens between now and the summer will determine if it's a revolution in open software design. The key here, imho, is for everyone who has a SOAP implementation that they're interested in validating against other implementations do it in the open, with public servers, outside firewalls. Let the community work on this, not the companies. There's a lot of heat right now, but Microsoft is again, excelling at listening. This is their biggest strength, and in my experience, is unique in this industry. "/>
					<outline text="What happens next must tap into the minds of the people who are implementing SOAP, some of whom are talented hard-working individuals, and others are small companies hoping to make a name for themselves by making an excellent technical contribution. There are medium-size companies, and others are huge, the largest technology companies in the world. They &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; deserve a chance to define what interop means for SOAP, we must have the expertise of all of them if it's going to be a market with lots of independent development. How these things gets started forms the genetic encoding of the community. At some point the standard-setting must stop, so it's safe to develop applications. The consensus seems to me, to be that that time is getting close."/>

Our marketing people (me) decided to call this feature &quot;Mirroring to Manila&quot;. Now our lead designer (also me) wants you to know that this connection is done with XML-RPC.

					<outline text="We struggle for our point of view to prevail, for no good cause, because it can't. I had an insight into that today. I'm afraid, like many others of the unknown nature of death. Then I realized that's bullshit. I'm more afraid of tomorrow. I have no idea what will happen then, any more than I have an idea of what happens after death. Why do I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; I know what will happen tomorrow? By extrapolation, by looking to the past, and using it to predict tomorrow. But here's the bug. I'm using my perception of the past to lull me into believing I understand the future, right up to the point of my death, after which I have no idea what happens. But! There is no such thing as the past. Now you say, oh what bullshit &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is. &quot;Of course there's a past,&quot; you say. But can you touch it? Can you in any way experience it? How do you know it exists? And if you think it does, tell a story about an event that happened in the past to someone else who was there. Why does their account of what happened differ from yours? If it could be appreciated, at a scientific level, then wouldn't you tell the same story? (And of course I'm not really afraid of tomorrow, that's just an excuse for not paying attention to now.)"/>

					<outline text="Another random thought. To people who say Blogs are nothing new, right on. What's really going on? Web writing software is maturing, getting easier and more accessible. It's the natural progression of technology. Refinement and ease of use. Once, a long time ago, we were confused about what the Web did. As we got less confused, we could narrow the functionality, make easier to use software, and bring new waves of people on board. The software industry merged with the Internet community in the mid-90s. That's all that happened. (I guess that was a lot though.)"/>
