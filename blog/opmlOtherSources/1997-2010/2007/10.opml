Leopard may be prettier than the last version, I'm not sure it is or isn't. Not sure I'll use many of the new features. For people who hadn't used VNC before, &quot;screen sharing&quot; would certainly be a big new feature if they're working in a networked enviroment.

If you have an expensive receiver, it already has nice converters. That would almost certainly sound better than taking the analog minijack output from your computer.

There are physical sensations to recorded music that I had never experienced before. I have some flac recordings and I ran those through the new setup and was blown away.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/1753439983/&quot;&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt;: The important thing about the back panel is that there are four optical (digital) inputs, which are compatible with the digital output of the Mac. So when you play an MP3 from the Mac, and connect to the receiver with the optical cable, the D-to-A conversion is done by the receiver. The Mac is $500 of computer hardware (and damn good at what it does) and the Denon is $2K of audio hardware, and also very good. This setup lets each system do what it does best. The result is &lt;i&gt;stunning&lt;/i&gt; sound. Really hard to explain how good it is." created="Fri, 26 Oct 2007 05:36:12 GMT"/>

					<outline text="When Mike was starting TechCrunch, I pointed to his blog all the time, with glowing praise, because I was truly impressed with what he was doing and because I wanted to encourage other people to do it too. I wanted people to write about technology products based on how they used them, not based on alliances, investment, posturing of execs, the crappy stuff that means almost nothing to users, and imho is just a substitute for actually understanding the technology. Mike was approaching products the way I felt they should be approached. Hence the praise." created="Mon, 22 Oct 2007 16:07:09 GMT"/>

					<outline text="However, that doesn't mean that if my opinion of TechCrunch, his business, isn't uniformly positive (and of course these days it is actually fairly negative) that I will withhold it. But it's also part of Mike's way of dealing with people that he sees criticism as betrayal. I just don't see it that way. I've had the shit kicked out of me so many times, and as a programmer I understand that criticism is necessary to perfect a user interface, even to get the damned thing working, that even when it hurts, I have to push the hurt aside and listen to what people are saying, and try to respond to it. Professionalism demands it. " created="Mon, 22 Oct 2007 15:59:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, one of the reasons I want to write this now is that I've written about Loic's business here a couple of times in very positive terms. I don't want anyone, esp Loic, to assume that this will always be so. If they get in the way of other creative people, or otherwise act as a poor example of entrepreneurship in technology, of course I will write about it, and will say what I think. I would expect Loic and people at his company to take what I write to heart, and consider it. My feelings won't be hurt if they don't do what I say.

It's possible to critcize someone's work and still admire the person. My epiphany is that a lot of people who thought were my friend, didn't understand this very basic thing about me.

With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best mobile platform ever for developers."/>
					<outline text="It will take until February to release an SDK because weÕre trying to do two diametrically opposed things at onceÑprovide an advanced and open platform to developers while at the same time protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, privacy attacks, etc. This is no easy task. Some claim that viruses and malware are not a problem on mobile phonesÑthis is simply not true. There have been serious viruses on other mobile phones already, including some that silently spread from phone to phone over the cell network. As our phones become more powerful, these malicious programs will become more dangerous. And since the iPhone is the most advanced phone ever, it will be a highly visible target."/>
					<outline text="Some companies are already taking action. Nokia, for example, is not allowing any applications to be loaded onto some of their newest phones unless they have a digital signature that can be traced back to a known developer. While this makes such a phone less than Òtotally open,Ó we believe it is a step in the right direction. We are working on an advanced system which will offer developers broad access to natively program the iPhoneÕs amazing software platform while at the same time protecting users from malicious programs."/>

All it takes is one or two of those pointers to promote your piece to the top level, and that &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; boosts your visibility, and now that the Leaderboard is there, it could make that status semi-permanent, creating an even greater incentive to point.

Honestly, I think it would be great for the tech blogosphere if they did. It would force more of those 609K people to use their subscriptions, rather than depend on Techmeme to find the important TechCrunch pieces.

					<outline text="If things were different I might use Feedburner. Especially on weekday mornings it's amazing how much traffic one file, my RSS 2.0 feed, gets. So it occurs to me that I could streamline things simply by offloading that file to Google. Now that they own Feedburner, this is something I might do, if they take a pledge not to break aggregators that depend on the format of my feed not changing. If someday my feed were to change format and break just one person reading it, I would consider that a serious support issue. It's not something I want to take a chance with. Some people trust &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; in this way. Not so many people as Google, but to me, they're very important. Could I delegate that trust to Google? No, not at this time." created="Tue, 02 Oct 2007 17:00:07 GMT"/>

Even though I don't choose to use Feedburner, because I subscribe to the feeds of people who do, I am effected when they change the format of their feeds. When Google does  this they inevitably break products that compete with theirs, the most obvious being Google Reader, but there are also server-side products that compete with Google's that depend on being able to read RSS feeds. If all of a sudden a large number of those feeds become invisible to them, people would find their services less useful, and therefore less competitive. This is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the kind of behavoir that made Microsoft such a bad corporate citizen in the 90s as they tried to suffocate the web to protect Windows and Office.

					<outline text="Now, amazingly, it seems as if Google may be doing this.

" created="Tue, 02 Oct 2007 17:03:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, as a responsible corporation, it seems that Google should say something. What's their policy about breaking users of Feedburner, and people who read their feeds? Is this something they will do quietly, a sort of &quot;silent data loss,&quot; or do they feel the need to be public about such policies? And what other products will they mess with this way. Will someday I look in my spreadsheet files and find that Google has changed the numbers? Or will emails from execs at Yahoo contain racial slurs or outright lies?

					<outline text="PPS. The existence of this list will probably make getting stories on TechMeme even more highly valued than before, if this list is taken as gospel, as Technorati's was, even with its flaws and skews. There was no correlation, for example, between flow and rank, a site with very high flow could have very low rank on Technorati, if it didn't get many inbound pointers. It was just one measure, as TechMeme is just one measure. " created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 13:22:29 GMT"/>

" created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 17:42:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Tim Berners-Lee understood, before there was a Mozilla and a Netscape, he said the web was inherently a two-way medium. We struggled against the inadequacies of MSIE as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/17/theWebIsAWritingEnvironmen.html&quot;&gt;writing environment&lt;/a&gt; when blogging was booting up in the late 90s and early 00s. The air was mighty thin, which was no accident, Microsoft deliberately tried to keep us from breathing. Because for them, writing was not something that would be done in a web browser, if they improved their browser as a writing tool, that would be the end of Word, and with it, a big reason for using Office. " created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 17:43:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Synopsis: Microsoft wouldn't let MSIE become a decent writing tool, because they were protecting Office.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 17:46:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="That eventually had to run its course, they couldn't hold back the inevitable forever. Sooner or later the web would route around their roadblock, and we'd be writing on the web, as we are today. It didn't happen the way I wanted it to happen, with decent writing software built into the browser, rather through the ingenuity and peseverence of programmers who managed to make HTML and Javascript approximate the user interface of a desktop app closely enough to make simple writing tasks work inside the web browser. It probably helps that today's computers have gigabytes of internal memory and several gigahertz of processing power. If instead, Microsoft had embraced the web, and with it the shift in their product line and economics, in 1995, we'd have a much richer writing environment today. Blogging would have happened sooner, in a bigger way. It's hard to imagine how much the sins of Microsoft cost all of us." created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 17:46:51 GMT"/>
