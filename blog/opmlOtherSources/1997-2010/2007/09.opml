				<outline text="Payloads for Twitter, round two" created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:09:59 GMT" name="payloadsForTwitterRoundTwo" type="outline">
					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/09/30/hebrewHunk.jpg&quot; width=&quot;95&quot; height=&quot;136&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named hebrewHunk.jpg&quot;&gt;On Friday evening I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/09/28/payloadsForTwitter.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about integrating images, audio and perhaps other types with Twitter. There's been a bit of reaction, not too much, I think because most of the people who are adversarial about this kind of stuff either don't use Twitter, or because it's the weekend. " created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:10:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Most of the reaction was either &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/hardaway/statuses/301102872&quot;&gt;puzzled&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mentalkipple.com/?p=119#comment-1543&quot;&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt;. An example of puzzlement. Isn't that what Pownce does? Yes, but... Two things: 1. Pownce is still invite-only and 2. Pownce doesn't have an API, so it's inherently not as interesting to me, as a developer, because I can't build things on it. " created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:32:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I like Twitter because it's open to anyone to use, without an invitation, and lots of people use it, people I care about, and it has a very nice API. Further, as I've gotten to know the people involved, I've learned that the API is of supreme importance to them. So our interests are in-line there. I see Twitter as a framework to build things on, a platform, like a big Christmas tree we can all hang ornaments on. I could build nicer ornaments with a few extra wires on the network that connects all the ornaments. In fact, I've already built two of them, and we use them all the time. But I couldn't ask too many people to use them because they're too ugly. What I've proposed is a way to make them pretty, to make them work the way people expect them to. " created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:25:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now another form of pushback is, well why don't you just build your own framework, different from Twitter, that does what you want, and leave Twitter alone. To which I say, I can't do anything to Twitter, other than talk about it. Whether to build the interfaces or not is up to the people at Twitter. I can have an opinion, yet ultimately the decision, and responsibility is theirs. Now, why don't I clone it? Well that's something I'm just not going to do. I have relaxed lifestyle these days. I'm beyond the point where I feel the need to prove anything through my work. I like to play and try out new ideas, just for the pleasure of it. If I were 20 years younger, I probably would be approaching this differently, but I'm not 20 years younger. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:14:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="No doubt there are people, lurking in the shadows, who would like to share some of Twitter's success. The idea is so good that we're just at the beginning of its adoption. Maybe there are as many as 50,000 people regularly using Twitter. I think in a few years there will be millions, using Twitter, or something very much like it. " created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:17:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/09/30/youngMenWithBuckets.gif&quot; width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;60&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named youngMenWithBuckets.gif&quot;&gt;But we're at a unique place in the evolution of this stuff, which in some ways is very good. Suppose there were 20 Twitter-like systems out there, and we wanted to add a feature to all of them. Forget it! Developers just don't like working with each other enough to overcome their competitive urge. But right now, with one player in the market, we could make 10 times the progress we'll be able to make when there are 2 or 3. And a million times the amount in a market with 20 Twitter-alikes." created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:18:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, the richer the API is, and the more broadly supported it is, the greater the incentive for newcomers to be compatible with Twitter. I don't get the warm fuzzies from Pownce that they are willing to follow anyone's lead, even though they don't yet have an API. But if anyone out there is brewing another entrant, and reading this, please please be compatible with the Twitter API. Not just the spirit, but the letter. Make sure that all the tools built for Twitter run without modification on your system." created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:20:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So these are just some of the additional thoughts. Evolution of APIs is an art, not a science. I've learned a lot about it before the Internet, and then in XML-based formats and protocols. We're at a sweet moment right now, and if the Twitter guys want to lead, and if the rest of us are willing to be led (I am) then we can really build something wonderful." created="Mon, 01 Oct 2007 00:21:38 GMT"/>

I heard about a program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17199&quot;&gt;Kismac&lt;/a&gt; that helps you debug wifi, and it was a little bit of help. But the tide turned when I decided to turn off wifi routers (I had four running) and see if the N800 would start working. Well, one of my two Airport Extremes made the difference, when I turned it off, the N800 started working. So after a bit I tried turning it back on, and the N800 still worked. No explanation, but knock wood, it's still working an hour later." created="Sun, 30 Sep 2007 02:11:26 GMT"/>

There's no question that American soldiers are killing Shi'ites in Iraq, and perhaps there's no question that Iran is arming our enemies in Iraq, but so what?

					<outline text="Before you blame anyone, it's not actually anyone's fault. It's a result of the market not being a monopoly.

Now that might actually happen, even though it's not very likely." created="Fri, 21 Sep 2007 19:25:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But podcasting, that's a whole other story. According to many people there's only one podcatcher, iTunes. So that's simplified the problem.

On the other hand, I don't see any movement right now to port the codebase to Linux, so maybe if someone is interested in the project, you should do it on your own, and just present the results.

					<outline text="I've done four conferences, three of them at universities, and one at CNET in San Francisco. At two of them, we hosted as many people as they did at TC40, because we had multiple tracks, and a very large facility. And the last three were all very much present on the net. The first, not so much. If I do another conference, we'd try to push the envelope on the net side of things, and probably not try to host as many people in person. Instead of 500 to 1000 people, I'd try for 50 to 100 people. Kind of a middle-ground between the experts at the TC40 conf, and the audience. More like a TV studio than a conference. Everyone would be either a blogger or reporter. All would be encouraged to participate. And everyone would lead a chat room, or a blog comment section, or a video track. We could have much more diverse video nowadays, because of services like justin.tv and ustream.tv, and I'm sure many others, who provide outbound bandwidth.

What a revelation, one of the most powerful political and economic forces, but until now, basically silent. There were so many interesting things in the interview, but one of them left me with an urgent action item. Lesley Stahl, the interviewer, asked what currency he got the advance on his book in? He said it didn't matter, because he could convert to whatever currency he wanted, begging the question. She pressed, and he volunteered that the best choice is to be diversified. Which of course is a conclusion every money manager would reach on their own, it's just like stocks and bonds, you never want to have all your eggs in one basket, the best strategy is to be diversified.

					<outline text="Sorry to be missing the TechCrunch 40 conference which starts tomorrow. I love demo-type conferences, I was one of the originators of the Demo conference, started by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stewartalsop.com/&quot;&gt;Stewart Alsop&lt;/a&gt; in the early 90s. The idea then was to take the drudgery out of going to huge shows like Comdex, where you'd have to walk past miles of meaningless booths to find the really interesting products, which often weren't even on the show floor. " created="Sun, 16 Sep 2007 22:10:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And even when you found the gems, the demos usually weren't very good. So Iobbied Stewart to do a conference that would flip the equation around. Do a conference where there were no booths. The demos would be done on computers at a desk, and the demoer was seated, as were the people receiving the demo, usually two or three at a time. Ideally, the demo would be done by the person who developed the product, or the CEO of the company, so that when you asked a question, you might actually get an intelligent answer. And limit the number of people showing to 30 or 40, people chosen by Stewart, who really has a love for intelligent and interesting products. The mind of Stewart of course was key to the process. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1995/01/04/demoingsoftwareforfunprofi.html&quot;&gt;guide to demoing software&lt;/a&gt; for the first Demo, which was given to all the demoers and presented at dinner the night before, by yours truly." created="Sun, 16 Sep 2007 22:13:08 GMT"/>

At one point, I was offered the job, but I turned it down because I was running a company. I don't think I would have been good at it anyway, because I'm more of a product developer than a connoiseur. Better to have someone like Stewart or Mike Arrington, who live to receive demos, do the choosing. In some sense I have been trying to create the perfect demo, to be a Demo God (a term I coined btw). I've not been to a Chris Shipley Demo, but I hear they're good. I'd like to go someday. I know Mike and Jason are trying to change things in this area, and change is good, and I don't doubt that Demo will adapt." created="Sun, 16 Sep 2007 22:15:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It is a shame to be missing the TechCrunch conference, but I guess there's a good reason for it, although I sure don't know what it is. Jason got very very mad at me for interrupting his speech at Gnomedex, and scorched my earth in every way he could think to. I think a mensch would regret doing that, and would say so publicly. I would like to get that out of the way so I could have fun at the conference like everyone else. But since he made me his bitch, it just wouldn't be fun being there listening to him present the demoers, thinking how mean he had been to me, in such a public and humiliating way.

					<outline text="1. I've said it many times before, it's worth raising again. Any newspaper or radio or TV station with a good reputation in its community could embrace the fresh ideas of the bloggers in their community by offering free blogs to members of the community, who may be new to blogging. I suggested this to the Times in 2001 -- when a person is quoted in a Times article, a few days after the piece runs, contact them, and ask if they'd like to have a NY Times hosted blog. There would be no control over what appeared on the blog. It would have a nytimes.com domain (something like bullmancuso.nytimes.com). Build an aggregator, something very much like Twitter (which is after all, a river of news, not exactly a new idea, heh) that shows all the new posts from members of the community. Encourage (but don't require) your editorial people to read the blog posts. Let whatever happens happen. " created="Sun, 16 Sep 2007 21:34:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Here's a new idea that I haven't proposed before. Open your newsroom to bloggers. Set aside a half-dozen desks for people who blog in your community, people you've gotten to know, and provide them with wifi, a water cooler, your coffee (no matter how bad it is) and chance to work alongside your editorial people and (very important) with each other. It's an incredible thing when bloggers get together in a physical space, the sparks can really fly. Now imagine what could happen if those sparks got flying between the remaining editorial people in a professional news organization and the bloggers. I believe the secret of scaling the news is right there, you just have to open the door and see what comes in." created="Sun, 16 Sep 2007 21:37:59 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The idea then came up again with the push to integrated software in the early 80s. Mitch Kapor and Lotus were selling the idea of an all-in-one package, Symphony, which was a word processor, database, spreadsheet, graphics and communication program, with a macro language tying it all together. Bill Gates proposed a different approach, let each app stand alone and share its data with other apps through a common scripting language. This idea was so good that I started a company in 1988, UserLand Software, to create such a scripting language for the Mac, which then had a rich user interface and a totally underdeveloped scripting interface. Today, the Macintosh has a rich tradition of interapplication communication, made possible by this simple idea that every app should have an API." created="Mon, 10 Sep 2007 18:58:03 GMT"/>

					<outline text="PS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.com/2007/09/06/dear-steve-jobs/&quot;&gt;Scoble wants an SDK&lt;/a&gt; so developers can create cool iPhone apps. Of course I do too. But I doubt it's going to happen anytime soon. Look at all the deals they can do if they don't. Starbucks wouldn't need them if there was an SDK. And Tulley's could do their own, as could Peet's, and Whole Foods, etc etc. Apple wants &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; that business, I'm sure. And they want to be able to sell Starbucks an exclusive. They couldn't if there was an SDK. So I bet we'll have to settle for the T-shirt or coffee mug, until someone routes around them. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 06 Sep 2007 20:02:26 GMT"/>

Not quite sure why I don't like it so much. Maybe because I don't think his competitors are quite as ruthless as he is. Maybe what he really means is this is how &lt;i&gt;Apple&lt;/i&gt; works, not how technology works." created="Thu, 06 Sep 2007 15:03:38 GMT"/>

I didn't know that. Seems that reporters should include that in every press report until Apple stops doing it. It's really tacky, like a laugh-track on an old 60s television comedy. To be clear, the people who are cheering are &lt;i&gt;paid&lt;/i&gt; to cheer. Maybe others disagree with Jim??" created="Thu, 06 Sep 2007 15:24:45 GMT"/>

					<outline text="But Naked Jen, who said she had the same disease, warned against believing you're better when you start &lt;i&gt;feeling&lt;/i&gt; better. She fell for it, and ended up being sick for two weeks. I've had that happen too. " created="Thu, 06 Sep 2007 14:59:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I spent yesterday bumming around, sleeping a lot, reading, did a little writing, etc. And today I feel even better. But I'm still going to ease out of the disease, not try to make up for lost time. I'll go to breakfast with the crew in a few, and then do some food shopping. Maybe a short walk, and more of the routine of the last week. Fluids, rest, nothing too heavy. " created="Thu, 06 Sep 2007 15:00:14 GMT"/>
