Not to the police, not to other individuals. (Far as we know.) Clearly he wanted his recordings broadcast -- after the deeds were done, and he was dead as well.&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't know if he thought about uploading them to YouTube. But, since he planned to fill the rest of his morning with murder, it's likely that he didn't want to post his plans on the Live Web -- where somebody might see it and get authorities to stop him. So he opted instead for snail mail and a big bang later on the small screen. YouTube would come, inevitably, later.&lt;p&gt;&quot;From what I gather, the police have seen and cleared the recordings for disclosure. So, presumably, there is no reason to protect anybody (for example, individuals Cho may have targeted for murder) other than broadcast viewers. (This is required by law, fwiw.)&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I think Dave is right. If there is nothing to hide here, other than obscenities that cannot be broadcast on TV or radio, there is no reason why NBC should withhold the recordings other than the belief that they own them, and hold them as property. That's their right; but it does not help the rest of us get clues that might help prevent another tragedy like this one.&lt;p&gt;&quot;And this tragedy isn't just about Cho and NBC. It's about the rest of us.&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I agree with Dave. More eyes will make the this bug shallower. It may save lives. Even if we see a zillion mashups of the original video, which we'll see eventually anyway.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Thu, 19 Apr 2007 03:03:59 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Here are some of the techniques I employed:" created="Fri, 13 Apr 2007 17:12:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Everything is static. It can all be seved by a standard install of Apache, with no plug-ins or special software required." created="Fri, 13 Apr 2007 16:53:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. It's self-contained. Every resource it uses is stored within the site's folder. That includes images, screen shots, example files, downloads." created="Fri, 13 Apr 2007 16:53:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Almost all the links are relative. As far as I know only one type of link is not, links to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/images/leftArrow.gif&quot;&gt;blue arrow&lt;/a&gt; that marks an internal document link. If for some reason at some time in the future, cyber.law.harvard.edu should go offline, and the site has been moved to a new location, the blue arrows will appear as broken images. I may yet fix this one. I don't think there are any other hard-coded links in the site." created="Fri, 13 Apr 2007 16:54:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The goal was to make it so that a future webmaster, wanting to relocate the site, would just have to move the folder, add some redirects, and everything would work, more or less. " created="Fri, 13 Apr 2007 17:04:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="You can also download the whole site, from a link on the site's &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/about.html&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;.

It's an optional channel-level &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#optionalChannelElements&quot;&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;. The example we provide is the previous location. I thought this was a good place for me to express the commitment to the spec being totally frozen, so I left it as it was.

Then a crawler would keep track of when it had last visited my site, and only suck down the files that had changed since then. This would enable search engines to be more efficient, and provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1996/09/07/FloatingIdeas.html#1&quot;&gt;more current&lt;/a&gt; content. It was nice because you could read it yourself and see what had changed. Contrast this with sitemaps, where you have to go hunting for the changes, it's no better a user interface for finding the new and newly updated stuff than the file sytstem is. I was kind of disappointed." created="Fri, 13 Apr 2007 17:38:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thing I would have done differently is allowed sitemaps to include other sitemaps.

I loved his books when I was young, and I made a point, four years ago, to re-read most of his books, so I've got an updated appreciation for how wonderful they are. And they were made more important for me because I shared his writing with my uncle, who had (I felt) a similar sense of humor, of irony. Like many others of my generation, Vonnegut formed my perspective on the world, on mysticism, and politics, on the smallness of everything we care about. If you've read &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan&quot;&gt;Sirens of Titan&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite Vonnegut book, you know what I'm talking about.

That may be true, but I want to know if Apache really reads and parses the htaccess file for every access. Is it not optimized to store the commands in an internal format and then check the mod date before re-loading and parsing the file?

					<outline text="There's a theory of social systems, a theory that has yet to be written, that will eventually group them into two distinct sets: balanced and imbalanced systems.

It won't be long, if it hasn't already happened, that there will be an eruption of angst about the A-list in Twitter, just as people grouse about the A-list in blogging. In Twitter terms, the A-list will be people who have lots of followers, more than the average person. It will be more pronounced in Twitter because you can clearly see how many followers someone has. It's like those Feedburner badges that say how many subscribers a site has, except in Twitter, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; has such a badge, and it's in a consistent place.

					<outline text="But this imbalance is what has made it possible for actual work to get done in the blog world. With balanced media, like a mail list, everyone is tightly coupled with everyone else. Imagine a company where every decision had to be ratified by everyone else.

Even the most innocuous &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/stories/storyReader$19964&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; were controversial, and once there's controversy that's the end of forward motion.

This is what the platform vendor worries about, assuming they care about their platform continuing to be a platform. I tried to deal with this by telegraphing my roadmap to developers. Aldus, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makingpages.org/pagemaker/history/&quot;&gt;Pagemaker&lt;/a&gt; product had an active developer community, had a rule that they wouldn't squash a developer for at least one product cycle, that is, they wouldn't integrate a developer's idea as a feature until version 4.0 if it came out during the lifetime of 2.0.

Sometimes developers choose a niche that's either directly in the path of the vendor, or even worse, on the roadmap of the vendor. In those cases, they don't really deserve our sympathy. It's almost like a game of PR, there's no way you're &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to have a fight on your hands. The various vendors of widget environments on the Mac come to mind.

They are truly a dangerous vendor to develop for, how are you going to figure out what motivates them (not profit for sure, their problem is how to get rid of the money they accumulate!) and you surely can't get acquired by them, and foundations don't attract competitors, so it's hard to imagine a rich suitor coming along wanting to create trouble for them.
