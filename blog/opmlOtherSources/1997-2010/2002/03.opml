They tend to give up immediately when they hit a problem since their investment in the process is minimal at best.&quot; What he says is true, and if you use Radio for its main purpose, you get to the pleasure button quickly without too many distractions. But if you wander into the outliner (deliberately hard to do) you need to pay attention. Someday we may have a product that is just an outliner. For now we have to put the outliner on the side, and make it relatively hard to find, so it doesn't trip up casual users." created="Sun, 31 Mar 2002 16:58:57 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="Two other people I appreciate. &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/03/30.html#a283&quot;&gt;Sam Ruby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0100886/2002/03/24.html#a89&quot;&gt;DizzyD&lt;/a&gt;. Dizzy is one of the leads on Jabber. Sam spotted a comment by Dizzy about instant outlining. Sam got it exactly right. We're in total bootstrap mode. This is the third implementation of I/O in the last few months at UserLand. In October I built one that ran on XML-RPC and depended on the software that became Radio Community Server. We have behind-firewall users at UserLand and people who travel with laptops, so the software got complex, it works, but I didn't want to support it. The next revision, which I did over the new year holidays, used the publish-subscribe model described in OPML 1.1 (sorry no spec, just an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/stories/storyReader$11&quot;&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; that it was coming) The third revision, the one people are using now, began with the most primitive HTTP-based polling. It just looks at the header and if the content length changed, it boldens the user and pre-caches the outline. It is so simple, yet reasonably efficient, and probably &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; scale pretty well. The problem with this approach is latency. It can take up to 30 seconds to learn of a change. In most circumstances that makes no difference, but when you're also talking on the phone with the person you're working with you &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; the latency and it's bad. That's where Jabber comes into it. It's just lack of human bandwidth that's keeping us from doing it right now. Think of Radio 8 as a user interface for Jabber, that's where we're going. Instant outlining is also a killer app for instant messaging. We &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to run on your network, we have no interest in duplicating what Jabber already does." created="Sat, 30 Mar 2002 18:06:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, I've seen it said that cloning RCS is not a good idea since we're already offering it for $0. This is wrong. Cloning it will get a package of capabilities integrated into the Jabber server, probably first, and perhaps AOL's and Microsoft's instant messaging servers. It's a blueprint for services that desktop users need, and we've provided the chickens, so if your egg is compatible, you don't have to wait. Apps drive markets. Without users, the programmers have nothing to do but jerk off. (And that's why there's so much jerking off, we forgot how to seduce users.)" created="Sat, 30 Mar 2002 18:22:49 GMT"/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.andredurand.com/stories/storyReader$273&quot;&gt;Andre Durand still&lt;/a&gt; believes the hype about open source. The loop has closed on this, they were just theories, that if you said &quot;create this for me for free&quot; that thousands of programmers would show up and magically work together in some kind of utopian way. In fact giving the code away caused programmers to get &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; user-centered, not more. Why should they pay attention to what you want? It's hard work to make stuff for users. Why should they work so hard when you aren't paying them? Hello Andre. &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2002/01/02/whenToGiveAwayTheTechnology#myRule&quot;&gt;Here's where&lt;/a&gt; I think openness fits into the equation, and it has very little to do with whether or not you let other people use your source any way they want to. And while it may seem obvious that giving away code removes the economic incentive, some people insist that a kind of communist magic happens that changes something that hasn't changed. You still need money to pay rent and buy food and put the kids through college. There was a bubble that caused people to believe this kind of babble. The bubble is gone.

They endlessly frustrated Adam, who believed in the software, and in people, but we were both disappointed by human nature when we were younger. Now we're not so young anymore.

					<outline text="Now, at the same time that I'm writing so much about outlining, it's so exciting to me to see these ideas begin to take hold, I'm also aware that many people using Radio may wonder what the heck I'm talking about. Reading this &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0104634/2002/03/29.html#a71&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Ernie the Attorney brings it home. &quot;I see a lot of us are still struggling to define what 'blogging is, and also what it has the power to be. I guess I am struggling too.&quot; I so admire Ernie, I kid you not, and I also think I know that outlining will be the logical next step after weblogs. I think in many ways they're the same thing. But please don't feel you have to understand what we're doing now. Scripting News is about the leading edge, and the road at the edge is pretty rough. It will probably be a few months or even years before this stuff is fully baked. But we sold a lot of outlining software to attorneys in the 80s, and I believe I know how deep the connection is, so eventually I think it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be relevant to them." created="Sat, 30 Mar 2002 17:08:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="As we explored instant outlining at UserLand starting in November we learned that some people are good at it, and some people are &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good. I can't judge my own work, because so much of the art is in the &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; of other people's outlines. For some people this will be their first experience on the other side of the fence, most people just use computers, very few people create things for other people to use. That changes with Instant Outlining. I've already written a bunch about how to create usable outlines, not published yet. Talking with Jon yesterday the question came up about who does it best. And hands-down that would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inessential.com/&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, who is no longer at UserLand. Brent's outline was always the model of clarity. As his manager I knew exactly where my input was needed, what he was planning to do, and what he had done. That's what managers want, imho. Clarity, and a sense that the person knows what he's doing and is in synch with the rest of the team. " created="Sat, 30 Mar 2002 16:54:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, if the past is a guide, there will be naysayers -- people who say Instant Outlining isn't for everyone. The last time we had this discussion, in the 80s, I didn't have a weblog, so I couldn't explain the subtle point, that it's OK if it's not for everyone. Organizations will form where good outlining skills are a requirement. UserLand is already such a place. We can't employ people who don't narrate their work in outline form and collaborate with others. In many organizations, where people jealously guard the information they accumulate, group outlining will be seen as a threat. But my belief is that organizations that try to compete with ones that use this tool will lose that competition. Teams that communicate with care, and focus on helping each other will win every time. So it's OK if it's not for everyone. " created="Sat, 30 Mar 2002 16:58:01 GMT"/>

At first I didn't get the magic of Monday, but then I realized that I had told people who were subscribing to my instant outline that I planned to publish &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; definitive piece on Monday, the 5th anniversary of Scripting News, and fourteenth for Frontier. Blah blah blah. So Jon wants to beat me. That is so cool. But he's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=hamstrung&quot;&gt;hamstrung&lt;/a&gt; by an editorial process that gets grouchy when he says he has a scoop. Oy I've been there myself. At Wired I had a big story, ran it through DaveNet, but wanted to get it on the Hotwired home page. They said I had to wait until my turn came around. In the meantime another pub read my story and took the scoop and put it on page 1, where it belonged. Jon says he's tempted to upstream his story to his Radio blog. I said do it, I want to read his take. I don't care if he gets out there first. I'm satisfied that I got there first with the software. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Fri, 29 Mar 2002 20:51:02 GMT" type="outline"/>

It will have to do some OCR and then look it up in some massive database that doesn't exist, and then send a message back to the fax machine saying yay or nay. Who will pay for that government database? We know Eisner has at least $700 million (unless he spent it all) -- so maybe he should pay for the database and all the new services the government is going to have to provide. Also something else to consider. The Supreme Court might think this is a First Amendment issue. I am not a lawyer, but due process and privacy might enter into it too. Do you want the government to read all your faxes? Hmmm. Luckily I don't have a fax machine, I hate the things, so it's not really a problem for me.

Look once or twice, don't see anything interesting, don't look again. There's so much other stuff to look at. Anyway, the trick is to have audience-entered material visible to the &lt;i&gt;moderator&lt;/i&gt;. Members of the audience, perhaps only 3 or 4, can comment in realtime on what's happening. The moderator is in both conversations. The difference in perspective between an audience member and a person on stage is so big, sitting in the audience I often wonder why don't they ask the obvious question now. Standing in line waiting for my turn guarantees that my comment or question will not apply to the discussion when I finally get my turn to speak. That's the vein of gold that Dan struck.

Summary of what's happened so far. Earlier this week Microsoft released the source for the core technologies of .NET in source form under their &quot;shared source&quot; license. What's the catch? For that you just have to read Miguel's email. Patents. Has Microsoft disclosed the patents they've filed on this stuff? The license appears to be buried in the source release, so if you want to stay clean, is there a way to read the license? Not clear. We know there are patents somewhere because Craig Mundie and David Stutz &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/10/05#lf5d331b641907c95b1c75fecba197580&quot;&gt;said so in public&lt;/a&gt;, last summer at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. (Postscript: Sam Ruby sent a &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdn-files/027/001/901/ShSourceCLIbetaLicense.htm&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; to the license.)" created="Thu, 28 Mar 2002 14:35:20 GMT"/>

Also, once I've paid for the music, I want to use it on any device I want to. And if I like a song I want to play it for people I care about so they can learn about me, and also be inspired by the music.

				<outline text="Music is important, not just for its monetary value. The philosophy of cynics is that there is no magic to music. Too bad for them, but music &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have healing powers. If you think about it, it's like &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/03/03/DonsAmazingPuzzle&quot;&gt;Don's Amazing Puzzle&lt;/a&gt;, so obvious, you have to work not to see it. Have you ever listened to a song from childhood and gotten goosebumps? Where does that music take you? Deep inside yourself, to places normal existence can't easily reach. The feelings, for me, are pleasure and relaxation. I feel it physically. The music I was getting from Napster is stuff that Eisner's distribution system &lt;i&gt;doesn't carry dammit.&lt;/i&gt; Being able to walk through my past over the Internet, through music, is a kind of therapy I want to share with everyone. Music has unique power to heal. So what's in the way of this experience? A few people who are worth hundreds of millions of dollars and want more. Yuck. The irony of it is, if they would get behind this instead of fighting it, they'd probably be able to milk it for even more money than the old distribution system. I never liked buying music in a store. I really would like to buy music on the Internet. Really. How much money? How many ways are there to spend money that bring happiness?

I have written extensively about the difference between amateurs and pros. I use the terms the same way they apply to athletics. There's no implication of higher quality on either side, but if I had to make a choice, I'd prefer to read amateur stuff, it's more honest, less conflicted. Integration means having bloggers write for the Times and having Times reporters keep blogs. I've also written about that. Tom asks some other questions that I don't think, as the CEO of a private company, I have to or want to answer. BTW, unlike Tom, I was against &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$16&quot;&gt;Third Voice&lt;/a&gt;. If it had caught on, there would have been no difference between the Web and mail lists. I like mail lists for what they are. And I like the Web for what it is. And I thought the Times challenge of Amazon over use of the Times Best-Seller List was tacky, but then I don't think much of Amazon either. They could have been Google, they could have been on our side, and a stupid worthless &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=amazon+one-click+patent&quot;&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; was enough to turn them to the dark side. I think the Pew Internet (pointer?) writeup nailed it. Someone at NYTD thinks weblogs are important. But it's a big organization, a very venerable one, and there are two sides to that. I don't want to inherit any of the Times' conflicts, I am solidly a blogger, and an amateur, but I do want to help ease them into the new practice of journalism, and at the same time help bloggers take ourselves and each other more seriously.

I think, but I don't know for sure, that we're getting links to stories that don't appear on the index pages on the Times' site. Second, they are a leader in their business, so it's likely to pry loose other XML-based feeds. We are already see evidence of that. Third, it's a first step down a road that will inevitably lead to, imho, an integration of amateur and professional journalism. The practices of each should be adopted by the other. " created="Thu, 21 Mar 2002 14:32:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My stake in the ground -- in a few years the home pages of the surviving professional sites will be weblogs. And in a few years, the art of writing for the Web will focus on domain expertise. Having NY Times stories on an equal footing with those written by bloggers will, imho, elevate the writing of the bloggers, it will tease out quality that today is possible, but give it the push that it needs to get to the next level. At the same time, some of the reporters at the Times may be inspired to check out a few of their new cousins to see what they're doing. Instead of a superficial dismissal, perhaps they'll see that there are some new tricks they can learn to liven up their writing and create bonds with their readers. Just as this process makes for better software, a two-way relationship based on respect between writers and readers improves the quality of writing." created="Thu, 21 Mar 2002 14:38:02 GMT"/>

So maybe my writing about deeper and more abstract things has fallen too? It's possible. Or another possibility. Maybe I learned what I wanted to teach myself.

				<outline text="A personal note on today's news. As I've probably said many times before, I grew up reading the NY Times. To me, they defined, as a young man, how an intelligent person with a curious mind approaches the world. We understand that everyone has a point of view, and style is part of news writing, but facts come first. When we started syndicating Web content in 1997, I set a goal to get the Times headlines flowing though our space. Today, amazingly, that goal is accomplished. To me it's a reminder that it's worth setting lofty goals, and I hope it's an inspiration to everyone in weblog-space. Writing with integrity has value no matter where it comes from. That the Times, such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=venerable&quot;&gt;venerable&lt;/a&gt; institution, was willing to trust us, fills my heart with pride.

					<outline text="I'm sure there's some confusion about what Radio Community Server is, and why we released it for $0, and what the next steps are. I think that's because we did something new, and probably unexpected. First, for all the bored pseudo-hooplah about web services, Radio Community Server is fully web services, built on open specifications, all of which have been around for a while, in one easy to install package. The press are only looking for web services from the BigCo's so they probably won't cover it, but I want you all to know, this is a tour de force of web services.

Some have said they can do it in a week, and that's of course not true. Sure they won't have to do some of the work we did, like design it and bootstrap it and create a community of users, but it's still a lot more work than it may appear to be, at first glance. But if you have a few months and want to do a cool piece of software, and can make it run faster or cheaper or in places we don't reach, go for it." created="Tue, 19 Mar 2002 15:04:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Modulo glitches and bugs, which we will work out, we now have a server product that can be installed on private networks, so people can use Radio for workgroups. Weblogs and knowledge management. We've broken through where no other blogging software has. Any workgroup can have weblogs and aggregators, people narrate their work, gain efficiencies and make connections that weren't possible before. " created="Tue, 19 Mar 2002 15:04:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But it's more than private networks that we want to enable -- there's a deep feature in Radio Community Server that allows an ISP to fully brand the user experience with their own look and feel. We've been quietly upgrading the workstation software so that it doesn't care which community its tethered to. When Radio boots up for the first time it connects to the cloud, gets the templates and themes and initial aggregator channels, as designed by the service provider. It's kind of like the AOL client software, where &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can be AOL if you want." created="Tue, 19 Mar 2002 15:08:24 GMT"/>

There are other deals in the pipe now, but first we have to do one more release of Radio, version 8.0.7, and this little bootstrap will be complete." created="Tue, 19 Mar 2002 15:11:00 GMT"/>

Have we lost our minds? I hope not. We still need to make money to make payroll. We gave this a lot of thought of course, it took years to arrive at RCS 1.0, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. But we figured that we'd do better financially if we let this out at no cost, so everyone who was interested could try it out, and since it drives Radio and Frontier sales, we'll make it up that way. Like a lot of other tech companies these days, UserLand needs cash. We want to work in a world where lots of people are running their own communities. So please accept our generosity, but if possible, return it. Buy a few copies of Radio for your workgroup or school. It's a bargain at $39.95. If you want a really powerful back-end, go for Frontier. We still have to make this work as a business so we can keep pushing the leading edge and bootstrapping the Two-Way-Web." created="Tue, 19 Mar 2002 15:16:39 GMT"/>

" created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:31:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="How much is the right amount? You end up chasing your tail. If an API is perfectly extensible then it says &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; about interop. Something has to be nailed down. Always at the cost of extensibility." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:53:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Imho, interop and extensibility are two opposing forces, like time and space. If you want your code to run faster, you can always burn memory. If you want your code to be smaller, it's very likely that it will run slower." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:33:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So we look for the sweet spot. What are people ready to agree on now? That's why the Blogger API was so important when it came out last summer. It was something the server vendors and the tool makers could use. The proof is in the result. Lots of tools got made. The sacrifice was extensibility. No longer were all our options open. Not all eventualities were forseen. If you had asked me then if I knew this, I would have said yes. But I went for it anyway. " created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:32:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2002/03/15.html#a322&quot;&gt;Simon Fell&lt;/a&gt; said he prefers SOAP to XML-RPC and RSS 1.0 to RSS 0.92, because they provide more extensibility. Of course I don't agree. XML-RPC is a means of implementing interfaces. The only way to use it is to extend it, without extension it is nothing. But it's got a frozen transport. Yeah you can't change that. That's why we get more interop from XML-RPC than we get from SOAP. I think that's clearly demonstrable." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:35:54 GMT"/>

Almost immediately after RSS 0.91 came out, developers independently added elements that were not in the spec that they needed in their applications. Some of them made public statements, and some probably didn't. Key point, it didn't break any of the aggregators. So in any real sense, just because a spec says it's more extensible, doesn't mean that it is. Watching the developer's list for RSS 1.0 since it started, I see the same problems surfacing that were in the way of evolution for the supposedly non-extensible flavor of RSS. But as long as the processors ignore elements they don't understand, there's no real advantage to using the other flavor. They traded off complexity and interop to get no additional extensibility, imho. Not a good deal. Not a sweet spot. Even 0.92, which (to my knowledge) is only supported by Radio, dwarves the installed base of the older 1.0 format. (An irony of the breakage in the community, 0.92 is &lt;i&gt;newer&lt;/i&gt; than 1.0)." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:37:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One more example, and then a conclusion. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://greg.turtleprod.com/index/2002/03/14#MSG899&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; of Conversant boast that they've gone so far towards extensibility that their interface is all structs, even the name of the procedure that's being called is encoded in a struct so presumably if the way of expressing the name of the procedure requires extension there will be no breakage. But have they actually done anything other than replicate XML-RPC? It appears to me that they've just pushed the stone one step up a staircase, and now have to deal with all the problems all over again." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:40:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now the conclusion. We have to agree on &lt;i&gt;something,&lt;/i&gt; for better or worse, in order to move forward. You can't keep all the options open for all time. This means there will be corner-turns. So far the Weblog API world has been very collegial and has produced real results at a very low cost. I believe we will be able to move forward, and the protocols and formats will evolve in a market-driven way, and when the corners are turned we will look to the tool developers to insulate users from the bumps. As long as we work together, it will work. That's what matters." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2002 17:42:21 GMT"/>

Women are organizers. Everywhere you go there are organizations of women doing things, planning stuff, making the world work. Men aren't like that. There isn't a &quot;Boy's Club&quot; where we get together to plot our world domination. But women always talk about the Boy's Club as if it existed. Heh.

Yeah we like to get laid (or mothered), that's why we have anything at all to do with women, in our natural unevolved state (evolved men, like women see the value in all points of view). Now women, while they organize, are not win-win beasts, they compete with each other viciously. I didn't tune into this until I was in my thirties.

					<outline text="Today Jon Udell remarks on the pace of innovation coming from UserLand. As I've been working on my next project, I can't imagine how stripped Jon's gears will be over the next one. This week's features were developed this week. The pace is impressive perhaps, except for two things. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 16:45:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, we have changes distribution down. There's been a lot of talk about software subscriptions, but we really do it here. We have a good system for getting new parts out to users. That contributes to the ease of development for us, and the fast pace. The second factor is that we do development in a very high level environment. Having an object database integrated intimately in the scripting environment means we have to write less code. The hard part is figuring out what to do, not usually how to do it." created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 17:01:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="That said, I'm getting ready to release some software that early Radio users got a peek at, it's a very grand vision (even for me) of something I call The World Outline, that's parallel to the HTML web, a new way of webbing. I remember how excited the most intelligent Frontier users were when we gave them a glimpse of this concept, but then we turned to the Desktop Website idea, to the exclusion of work on The World Outline." created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 16:48:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I roll it out, Murphy-willing, next week -- I'll deliberately show it in a diminutive way. I'll show you how to get started. It'll appear to be much less than it is. Then the smart people will ask if it can do this or that, and the answer will be yes. Then the bomb will explode in some people's heads, they'll try things out and find that they work. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 16:50:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This bit of bombing will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be like the features this week. They will have been many years in the making. In some ways the software will be insufficient, but will point in a direction and invite competition. It will encourage people who make Web apps to put OPML interfaces on them. It's our job to deliver the users as an incentive to developers. We will do that." created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 17:01:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But the art of the next bomblet won't be in the bombing, it will be in the smooth ramp, the seduction that gets people to try it without being overwhelmed by its hugeness. It will appear to be an evolution on instant messaging. But in fact it will be much more. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 16:55:20 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Sam Ruby has been blogging for almost three months, and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html&quot;&gt;rambling essay&lt;/a&gt; explaining why he blogs. Along the way he almost touches on the reason I blog. Back in a minute with first coffee of the day and an essaylet."/>
					<outline text="First, even if I wasn't a software developer I would probably have a weblog. I just wouldn't have been among the first to do it, because when I started you needed technical skills that are not necessary today. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 14:02:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a software developer, and my weblog is all about that. Why do I need a weblog? Well, I want to get a true connection between people who use my software and myself. I want to talk directly with them. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 14:03:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I started writing publicly on the Internet in 1994 that was the epiphany. I can get my ideas in front of the people who matter in my industry, without the middlemen. (Ironically I also want the middlemen to write about my software, so I'm a flawed human being, what else is new.)" created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 14:04:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And as a person who consumes information about software products, I was always frustrated that they wouldn't let the developer say in his or her own words what the purpose of the product is. So when a developer like Sam shows up in the blogging world, even if he didn't use my software, that's a victory for my profession. Another developer who decides to speak for himself. Since you can't lie to a compiler, eventually the truth pops off the stack, and I learn something, some new compatibility develops, I see someone else's point of view. When interop happens at a human level, interop at a software level can't be far behind." created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 14:05:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So weblogs cut out the middleman. It's a collaborative development environment. A way of doing open engineering using the Internet. There's more to do here, but it's also worth noting that there have been some accomplishments." created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 14:05:58 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I know some people feel that way, but I wish they would lose it. It's not a cooool idea. When Manila was new, in early Y2K, we went through this too. Fact is, some of you will get more flow than I get. It's in the numbers. The more blogs there are the more likely someone is going to hit the nerve and become the next MattyG, or Heroes and Villains, Joel Spolsky or Wes Felter. Even Evan Williams of Blogger was reading DaveNets before he left O'Reilly to start Pyra. Robot Wisdom and CamWorld started with my software too. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2002 14:17:27 GMT"/>

Centralized services go down or get clogged and require a lot of supervision. The design of RCS is part of a bet I made in Y2K that &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites&quot;&gt;desktop websites&lt;/a&gt; are the way of the future, because the users get full control of their data, and they don't have to share a CPU with lots of other users. CPUs are cheap. People cost a lot more. There's a lot of power on today's desktop machines that isn't well-utilized. Anyway, in a perfect world, we wouldn't even need RCS, but net bandwidth being what it is, and NATs and so forth, we need something lightweight that's centralized to glue groups of people together.

Some people had asked what the Please Notify entries on their Events pages are about. Here's the scoop. Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/rss092&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds have an element in their header called &quot;cloud&quot; that tells a reader how to subscribe to the channel. When you're subscribed to such a feed, Radio automatically requests notification. That's what Please Notify is about. Then when it changes, if everything goes well, the cloud sends a short message to Radio saying &quot;Hey this resource changed.&quot; Then again, Murphy-willing, your Radio reads the feed and if there really are new items, it adds them to your News Aggregator page.

There's a little story first. A long time ago when weblogs.com was starting, we had a little thing where people could choose their own Zeldman icons and when they updated the icon would appear on Scripting News (with a link of course). When we did the big weblogs.com corner-turn last fall, the icons &lt;a href=&quot;http://newhome.weblogs.com/theZeldmansReturn&quot;&gt;came back&lt;/a&gt; (on the weblogs.com &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;), but only some of the weblogs-with-icons made the transition. I've been tracking updates of the Zeldman-iconified weblogs since the corner-turn, and today I finally was in the right place in the right mood to write out an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/iconUsers.xml&quot;&gt;XML feed&lt;/a&gt; (every fifteen minutes) with the in-use icons. For each icon it says when the weblog last updated (in GMT), how many times it has updated since we started tracking, and links to the website. Maybe there's some interesting data to track here?

It went like this. &quot;Joe Frazier you gonna be so messed up on March the Eighth, even Vitalis won't hep,&quot; said the heavyweight champ.

In December the NY Times said that Paul Nakada's &lt;a href=&quot;http://segway.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Segway weblog&lt;/a&gt; was authoritative, but I guess their link &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ny+times+nakada+segway&quot;&gt;didn't count&lt;/a&gt; because Google can't get into the Times because of the cookie requirement.

					<outline text="In stealth mode, I've been working on a project called RCS, or Radio Community Server. It's basically at an alpha level now. The idea is to make installing the centralized side of a Radio community as easy as installing Radio on a workstation. It's a fascinating bootstrap, the software is ready, but I need users. How to entice them? Features, of course. So this morning I'm turning in a different direction, I'm working on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/17#webBugsInXml&quot;&gt;Web Bug Simulator&lt;/a&gt; for XML feeds. It's very interesting, along the lines of the articles by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/webservices/2002/03/01/udell.html&quot;&gt;Udell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/01/28/020128opcurve.xml&quot;&gt;Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;. A lab for developing community services. OK, here's the idea. We can track hits and referers for HTML by putting a web bug in the page, and when the browser loads the page it asks for the bug, and with a little Javascript &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=hack&quot;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, we can tabulate and &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/staticSiteStats/groups/radio1/report.html&quot;&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; the sites, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://subhonker6.userland.com/staticSiteStats/referers?group=radio1&amp;site=0001014&quot;&gt;count&lt;/a&gt; the referers. But how to do that for an XML feed which only goes through the browser after being digested by the aggregator? Not so hard to figure out when you phrase the question that way. But there's an opportunity for refinement because my client code is less crude than the meager &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=hack&quot;&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; the HTML browser gives me. I'm tracking the number of new stories times the number of people who read it, so a site that doesn't update its XML feed falls off the chart, as it should, because it's not saying anything new even if a lot of people are subscribing. Anyway I hope to have some results to show for this shortly. Diggin." created="Sun, 03 Mar 2002 17:39:45 GMT"/>

When they shut off Napster I stopped caring. A few days before Morpheus shut down last month I downloaded the software and installed it. I had a specific mission in mind. My MP3 collection had almost no &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.costello-online.com/&quot;&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt;, and, having heard an NPR interview with him, I was interested. So I booted up Morpheus and went looking and found lots of hits, mostly the songs I already had, and downloaded a couple I hadn't, and the quality was so low, I threw them in the trash. My time is worth money and of course I would have happily downloaded a curated and quality-assured package of Elvis songs, with written narrative (he's an interesting guy, very smart, a good story teller) for $39. Charge it to my credit card. I thought I'd mention that, because like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mattgoyer.com/2002/02/24.html#a1072&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mouseplanet.com/notebook/eisner.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/03/03/eisner.gif&quot; width=&quot;45&quot; height=&quot;49&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;15&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named eisner.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I spend $0 on music now, and no that's not a story of Napster screwing things up, it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/life/travel/leisure/2000/ltl749.htm&quot;&gt;Eisner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/11/01/gay_aol/&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/a&gt; that screwed it up. While I was using Napster I was a veritable pump of money into their coffers to make the point to myself and anyone else who cared that it wasn't about money, it was about love of music and wanting it to come to me easily, conveniently and with high quality. For the 18th time, we want to work with the music business. Why can't they hear that. Instead they're lobbying Congress to rape the computer industry so they can get all the money we would supposedly send to them after they did that. Oy. We'd burn their houses, figuratively of course.

The reporter who swoops into an area for two weeks, then writes a piece and moves on, never gets the story.

This is an immature medium, so I have to say that I love Steve, I've worked with him many times, and am grateful for all that he's done to help us. That said, what a loopback. What a hoop to jump through. It's hard to imagine that changing our Apple Event code will generate any more sales. How are we supposed to pay for this work? Yeah, money is that tight in 2002. The quid pro quo on this would be for Apple to do something meaningful to tell people how cool Radio 8 and Frontier are, as Mac apps, so we get more sales, to provide the money it's going to cost to turn this corner with them. We'll probably do this one, our users will help (some have already offered), they're good people -- but geez, I want to focus on work that makes our software more valuable, and it's hard to see how this change does that. Second point, it's a loopback to the old days when every release of the Mac OS would break lots of apps. It worked in the 80s when Apple was the only game in GUIs. It's a hard sell now. What is Apple's commitment to keeping our code running? Serious question. We've been shipping code on Windows since 1998, already long enough to know how it works with MS as a platform vendor. In that time, with lots of new releases of Windows, no breakage. Apple has to match that, imho. Even though MS has never made a commitment about no breakage (as far as I know), their track record speaks for itself.
