At 7PM there will be a planned outage on the static server, as we try to nuke the worm. If it works, everything should be back up by 8PM. If not, we go to plan B, and remap DNS to point to the new server. That will take as long as it takes for the DNS changes to percolate. " created="Tue, 30 Apr 2002 18:18:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

And a quote. &quot;What we've found though is that roughly 75% of web applications are built by scripting level developers.&quot; Personally, I think a lot of them use non-Microsoft and non-IBM tools and environments. I'd like to see them pitch their capabilities to all developers. Later he says that they've been working privately with Microsoft on interop. This is what I mean by having BigCo's on the brain. When we've tried to work with either Macromedia or Allaire they tell us about their plans to work with the Bigs. They say it nicely, but it's so frustrating.

Even better, it provides you with a complete back-up of your weblog on your desktop and the ability to add to your weblog while disconnected.  Given that it is decentralized, you can opt to self-host your weblog at your ISP or on your corporate Intranet in under a minute.&quot; I posted this to correct some incorrect information that's floating around. We worked really hard for a couple of years to build a completely decentralized system. It takes a few minutes to post an incorrect analysis of the product, and then that floats around out there, and hurts our business. Play fair. Our product isn't perfect, for sure, but don't ding us for not doing things the product does do." created="Tue, 30 Apr 2002 15:41:40 GMT" type="outline"/>

Lots of nouns, just a few verbs. I don't want to reignite the flames after all these years, but I should say that I was on the RPC side then too. Who wants a lot of nouns. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rt.com/man/atoi.3.html&quot;&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt; that tell you what the parameters are and what each of the procedures returns. I don't believe in super flexible interfaces, I like enumerated entry points. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/file/exists&quot;&gt;verb set&lt;/a&gt; for our programming environment.

				<outline text="It's been one of the most &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt; days yet. An outage, some personal stuff (sorry I don't do that here) and then I got an email, from a lawyer at the Church of Scientology wanting us to remove their copyrighted material from one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wws.editthispage.com/2001/03/17&quot;&gt;free sites&lt;/a&gt; we host. I looked at the site, and they may have a point. There is some blockquoted material, the author claims that it comes from a Scientology document, or does it? Is it fair use? The passage is fairly long. I am not a lawyer. And unlike Google, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; playing the role of an ISP, although we don't derive any revenue from hosting the site. Further I'm not that interested in Scientology and I have a few other things on my mind.

A few predictable name-calling emails saying (I guess) that the only way to solve the problem is to kill Palestinians. I generally don't respond, because being warlike in an email seems kind of contradictory. If you have such a will to die for your cause, go fight and good luck, but email is a tool for people who wish to reason and think. Imho, you can't do violence in email, yet some people persist in trying. Other more thoughful responses ask me to see it from the point of view of an Israeli, and that's fine, we've done a lot of that for a long time, now try to see it from the point of view of an American. Israel is a distributor of American power. If it weren't for the US, we assume, Israel would not exist. It certainly has no hope of peace without help from the US. If I have doubts about exactly what we would be going to war to protect, I imagine a few other Americans do too. I think we've made a big mistake by letting the Israeli point of view dominate the discourse. We are two separate countries. " created="Sat, 27 Apr 2002 19:52:45 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="When I read the account of Gates' testimony yesterday I dashed off an email to people at Microsoft who I consider friends. I'm still willing to help Microsoft, but first we have to deal with the mess. " created="Tue, 23 Apr 2002 15:50:09 GMT"/>

					<outline text="My belief: The conviction was the correct result. Now they must come up with a penalty that is appropriate, that will prevent Microsoft and future would-be Microsofts from using a monopoly in one technology to gain a monopoly in another. To allow juggernauts like Netscape a little breathing room to learn and make mistakes before they have to deal with a monopoly that acts willfully to cut off their air supply. To make Microsoft a better platform vendor, with more developers, with more new ideas being tried out. To help developers and their investors trust the market, without illegal and unethical interference from Microsoft." created="Tue, 23 Apr 2002 16:05:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On strictly pragmatic terms, if Microsoft isn't lying when it says it wants developers for its new platform, they should welcome the opportunity to get its developer relations back on track. Yesterday's survey says that at least people who read Scripting News, many of whom are developers, don't trust them. You can try to rationalize it any way you want, but a majority said clearly that they believe Gates lied about something that is central to the issues at hand. Arguing with me is pointless. The problem is deep. A major correction now is something that a Microsoft that's thinking long-term should welcome." created="Tue, 23 Apr 2002 15:59:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Microsoft clearly doesn't have any vision for the Web other than owning and controlling and freezing it. As Web developers, it was &lt;i&gt;our air supply&lt;/i&gt; that Microsoft cut off. The correct solution is to decouple the Web from Microsoft in a permanent and non-revokable way. It should be done in a way that causes the least possible disruption of service for users, while creating the maximum possibility for competition. For Microsoft to argue fairness is ridiculous. They are not qualified to argue about fairness." created="Tue, 23 Apr 2002 16:07:37 GMT"/>

It isn't. That is a private implementation detail. Everyone's implementations will vary and all implementations will vary over time. RPC also implies that the caller knows the signature and classes of the receiver. In fact, it is a miracle if the one application's classes and parameter order happen to match another's. In the real world, every implementation will have its own classes.&quot; Finally it's clear what we've been debating and why we disagree. In my model of loosely-coupled apps, there is no variability allowed in the places Bosworth says he must allow it. If you want to implement the Google API, you must implement the same method names, and they must take the same parameters and return equivalent results (the search databases are different in different search engines). We went through this with the Blogger API, and it worked fine. I don't see the value in allowing variability, because you trade that off against complexity, too high a cost, too little gain.

There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; extra stuff in SOAP that's not present in XML-RPC. But the details are hidden in most scripting platforms, so the extra stuff isn't in anyone's way. Interop was in question, but a lot of the concerns were laid to rest with Google's interop. Now any reasonable person, no matter what their protocol preference, should be able to move on from here. Even the REST folk are fine, if it weren't for Amazon's patent mess, I'd be banging the drums for their XML interface too, but not to the exclusion of SOAP and XML-RPC.

				<outline text="Yesterday was the one week anniversary of the release of the Google API. In that week, we explored many of the nooks and crannies of the power it reveals, but certainly not all of them. That the experiments are so unsatisfying is not for the lack of interest among developers. We'll do it again and again, no matter what the naysayers say, no matter how silly the examples are, this is how you explore a new capability, this is how we get creative, as a community, by turning off the judgment and playing. It's like tennis. Google hits the ball over the net, we hit it back. Now we hope they respond by exposing more functionality. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1303&quot;&gt;Edd Dumbill's rejection&lt;/a&gt; means nothing to users (what is /bin/dev/whatever anyway?) but the Cape Clear &lt;a href=&quot;http://capescience.capeclear.com/google/&quot;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; he disses &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; interesting, even if it irritates him. (What about the email addresses they're accumulating, that worries me.) Anyway it's possible that somewhere in the small Google API there's a nugget we haven't yet found, an application that transforms the Internet in some way that's meaningful to someone. And we can hope that Google and other big centralized services see the power of interested developers and try out some more new ideas we can experiment with." created="Fri, 19 Apr 2002 14:33:26 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Some people think that the vague roadmap that the W3C offers is the true path to wonder and enlightenment. We've been here before, maybe some of you haven't, but the big proclamations very often fail. (Actually, empirically, they always do.) For me, this goes back to the boom of Lotus 1-2-3, and the assumption by many that their follow-on, Symphony, would replace it in short order. It didn't happen. Magic isn't something you can invoke through planning and speeches, conferences and consortia and cover stories in the BigPubs. It only happens when the time is right. Old beliefs die hard. It's better to accept magic when it happens than to try to hold on to your old ideas. Radio is a rocket ship. To say it's not the endgame, well what is? Is the Web? No way. Someday it will look like an Apple II looks today. So to say Radio is not the endgame is a no op. As long as humanity survives there will be another iteration. But when you find something that has some of that magic, go for it, don't be a stick in the mud, and don't pay too much attention to people who are." created="Fri, 19 Apr 2002 14:49:21 GMT" type="outline"/>

I'll be doing Scripting News in person, which I describe as &quot;Blogging Without The Screen.&quot; I've done lots of those kinds of sessions. Here's how it works. I have a mike and I talk for a bit, just like my morning coffee notes. I say things to get people thinking. Then when someone has something to say, I go them and we have a little conversation, until someone else wants to talk, and then I go over to them and do the same thing. It's like a weblog, but face-to-face. No one has to line up at the mike, it's very informal, no time to get nervous, and different points of view get heard. The experts are the people in the audience, not panelists. Maybe this year someone will blog the session.

					<outline text="Over the last few weeks, the archives for Y2K contained a painful story that I haven't linked to, but it deserves a comment from a two-year perspective. Here's what happened. Our Internet service turned to crap. Our T1 line went down for long periods of time every day. Everyone who used our services knew it was going down. There was no way to hide from that. We investigated the problem, worked with our ISP, and did what we always do -- shared what we learned with our readers. I built an app that measured the outages, computed the amount of downtime, and made the info publicly available. Of course they could only be read when the line was up." created="Wed, 17 Apr 2002 14:19:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Frustration crept in, because humans were involved. For the most part, we all kept our cool. Antonio Salerno, the CEO of Conxion was on the DaveNet list, and had the idea that the T1 line was used to send out an essay or two each week via email. This was the big disconnect. At the time we were hosting thousands of Manila sites at the end of the T1 line. We were working on SOAP with Microsoft. We were releasing new software to our users. We had a diverse development team that connected through the T1 line. When it went down, all that stopped. Salerno warned me to stop writing about the outages. I said no. I asked my readers for help, esp people at the San Jose Mercury-News, because they cover San Jose (of course) and the ISP was located in San Jose. But it hit even closer to home. We were hosting Dan Gillmor's weblog at the time. I felt they should cover it because the issue wasn't about technology as much as it was about honoring the First Amendment.

					<outline text="From two years hindsight, I would have done nothing different. If there are outages that users and readers see, you have to say what's going on. I didn't see any way around it then, and I don't now. There were three business entities involved. UserLand, Conxion and PacBell. We should have worked as a team, to get everyone back online asap. PacBell did the best they could, so did UserLand, and at Conxion, all but one person worked hard and professionally, with empathy, every day we were out, to get everyone back online. We were shut down because one person wanted us to do something that we couldn't do. We survived. But I learned that the speech guaranteed by the Constitution is not a sure thing.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel Berlinger asks&lt;/a&gt; why I think the syntactically relevant indentation of Python was a breakthrough. There are a couple of reasons. First, it removes complexity from the language. Semicolons and curly braces are not needed when you let tabs and carriage returns do the work. The two methods of expressing structure are redundant, and if I had to choose I'd pick the one that visually reflected the stucture, which tabs and returns do, and imho semicolons and curly braces don't. The second reason I like it is because it enforces a common indentation format on all code and ends silly arguments on coding teams about which way is right. Since we all eventually have to read and use other people's code, in Python, you're guaranteed that you don't have to spend hours indenting the code so you can work with it, it already is indented in a way you are comfortable with because all Python programmers indent the same way. Of course this doesn't solve the problem fully, it's just a step, a theme, a message to programmers that some stylistic differences aren't worth fighting over. BTW, this is not an &lt;i&gt;exclusive&lt;/i&gt; advantage of Python. Frontier, which was started a a couple of years before Python, also takes this approach (and goes further, its IDE is an outliner). We don't argue about indentation in our community. There's only one way to do it. (The right way of course, since I designed it. Heh. Sorry.) Anyway, I try to be kind and generous to Python because the community's philosophy is so close to ours, we like being friends with them, and I hope vice versa." created="Tue, 16 Apr 2002 19:36:06 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="In the 80s a bunch of word processors claimed they did outlining, but they didn't. WordPerfect was the classic example. They did outline numbering, but didn't support expand/collapse or reorganize according to structure, the two basic features of outlining. You can't say you are an outliner if you don't do those two things. (Well, you can say it but it isn't true.)

Back at the dawn of the PC era there were a handful of people who thought you could do anything in a word processor, even a spreadsheet, and get this, they were right. But (there had to be a but, right?) you don't get recalc in a WP. And in a flat text editor you don't get expand and collapse or the ability to reorganize according to structure. Python is a breakthrough language in that it considers indentation to be syntactically revlevant. Our outliner-based language environment takes it further -- by editing in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1122&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt;, you get the ability to hide detail and move huge branches of code around with a single keystroke.

				<outline text="BTW, so many people miss the utlitity of a format like OPML by missing the tool that's used to edit and browse it. It's like evaluating a car by lifting the hood and looking at the engine. You can learn something by doing that. But you can't evaluate the driving experience that way. To do that you have to dive in and &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; it. I never would have understood HTML if I didn't use the browser first. Even so, I had trouble understanding HTML without looking again and again, trying to piece together how the format related to the experience. There aren't any shortcuts. I'm not impressed by people with closed minds, all I get from that is that their mind is closed. Open minds are interesting. Another example was the Mac in the 1980s.

Don't you like your air supply? Why not implement &lt;i&gt;Web&lt;/i&gt; services so everyone gets the message that it's for them too, even if they don't use Microsoft software? Hmmmm. The other day I suggested that those of us who don't use any MS software should fly their colors (I'm not one of those people, btw). Now another related idea. Perhaps we should target for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=annihilation&amp;r=2&quot;&gt;annihilation&lt;/a&gt; any developer who promotes their open services as being Microsoft-compliant. Just to prove that in this layer of technology, there is no such thing. See how Google's across-the-board &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/directory/4/services/googleApi/implementations&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; changed things?

				<outline text="Now, I understand why Akamai might want to announce a deal with Microsoft. But they should know that it comes at a cost. Where they could be a platform vendor, and attract developers to help them, they are giving the full developer opportunity to Microsoft. And given the rep that MS has with developers, that's just going to incentivize competition, and waste the value of Akamai's work. Akamai's technology is not so deep.

				<outline text="From the land of incest and irony. Business 2.0, which is owned by AOL, has two pieces that connect the dots.

Performance art! A great line at the close of the piece on AOL. &quot;It needs a hundred digital czars -- the leaders of every business unit -- trying to figure out how to turn the Web into the primary means of distributing content, and combining it with that of other businesses to make entirely new products.&quot; Amen to that.

I met Adam at a AOL confab in late 1994, at David Cole's mansion in northern Virginia. It was quite a party. Lots of geeks with powerful minds and suits with big checkbooks, and celebs like Adam (before he got his haircut). Adam shared his &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/10/31/virtualBandwidth&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; for content distribution over the Internet, a few years later, when I met him in NY. The vision is implemented, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/04/16/enclosureprefs.gif&quot;&gt;quietly&lt;/a&gt;, in Radio 8. If anyone from AOL is tuned in, and wants to try out a &lt;i&gt;new idea&lt;/i&gt; for moving big bits of content around the net, without watiting for universal broadband, let me know. It scales, it works, and when you get it you'll slap your hand on your forehead, it's so simple.

On Saturday, while I was writing my last DaveNet &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2002/04/13/whatsNextAfterTheGoogleApi&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, listing the reasons why I thought Google's API was significant, I thought I should &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/soapbuilders/message/7440&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; item #3 to the Soapbuilders list. I thought it was important to mark the occasion.

I just went for my daily walk, and I realized there's someone I forgot to congratulate, and thank, for all his hard work. It was (probably) Apache's SOAP that Google deployed, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://xml.apache.org/soap/contributors.html&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; interop that gave us all such a great experience in the rush to get Google working with our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/directory/4/services/googleApi/implementations&quot;&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; scripting environments.

First, deliver a multi-vendor SOAP-based writing-publishing system that uses no Microsoft software. Then switch out the non-Microsoft components with Microsoft pieces, where they exist, one at a time, and have it still work.&quot; Here's what's interesting about that. Even though the leaders of the SOAP interop process, at the time, hadn't tuned into weblogs then, now many of them have. And the plan that we proposed, of course, was the blueprint for what we did. Today you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; run a modern Web publishing system &lt;i&gt;using no Microsoft software. &lt;/i&gt;I think we need some kind of logo for that. &quot;This weblog is produced using nothing from Microsoft.&quot; Easing our dependence on MS is good for everyone, including Microsoft, imho." created="Sun, 14 Apr 2002 15:21:14 GMT" type="outline"/>

It's about cross-company collaboration with wires running over the Internet. Of course that's what we're doing with Radio as well. An important point, Yahoo is already the leader in this area and is too clueless to capitalize on it. In yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2002/04/13/whatsNextAfterTheGoogleApi&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt; when I listed the companies who were ripe for SOAP, I had originally put Yahoo on the list. I took them off because they're still thinking dotcom and advertising (or at least that's what you'd conclude if you used their service). One more thing. Paypal and Digital River should have been on the list. I want to get notification via SOAP or XML-RPC when a customer purchases a product so our servers can automatically enable services. Now there's still a manual step in the process. This doesn't require high security, but it would enable us to broaden our offerings and make more money flow. One more thing if anyone from Groove is tuned in. Is the new Groove in any way open? Does it support SOAP or XML-RPC or even RSS? When Ray went on his initial road show for Groove 1.0 he made a big deal about that, but the wires never materialized. Are they here now?" created="Sun, 14 Apr 2002 14:59:35 GMT" type="outline"/>

It seems so sophisticated and complicated. In fact, a consortium of all of the telecommunications regulatory agencies and companies united in an effort to create a world-wide standard for email. It was called X.400 and the effort started in the early 1980's. While waiting for X.400 there was a need for an interim protocol. Since it was only temporary, the emphasis was on expedience and just making it work. Instead of creating a whole complicated set of protocols and tools, the implementers just built a simple extension of the protocol used to type commands into a computer. The program itself is called Telnet and it is still available today. The protocol, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Program), is dominant while X.400 is almost forgotten.&quot;" created="Sun, 14 Apr 2002 01:58:46 GMT" type="outline"/>

The next thing on our plate is a release of Frontier that installs as easily as Radio. We've learned a lot about installing Web servers in the two years since we've done a new installer for Frontier. The goal of this release is similar to the one we had for Radio. Five minutes after download you should be entering text into your first Manila site. The core difference between Radio and Frontier: Radio is personal, one weblog per installation. Frontier is for groups. Hundreds of personal weblogs per server. Radio is distributed. Manila is centralized. &lt;i&gt;Zig-zag.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Tue, 09 Apr 2002 17:16:49 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Another way of looking at it. Manila, which is bundled with Frontier, competes with Movable Type. Radio, at this time, appears to not have any competition (of course it's coming).

				<outline text="A what-if about search engines.

No more.&quot; Competition is going to open new vistas. The race is on. The big gaping hole in search? All the content on my desktop, and yours. The goal? Easy five minute install, instant results, integrated with all the knowledge of the www. Why do we need to tweak the crawling policies? If search is going to work on local area networks, page rank means nothing unless people have weblogs. A passive crawler won't give people what they want. But if a popular search engine supported the simple Weblogs.Com ping protocol, they could re-index weblogs when they update, making search much more valuable because the currency of the index goes way up." created="Tue, 09 Apr 2002 16:47:36 GMT" type="outline"/>

Who knows whether it was wise or not, but in April 1996, I went back into Frontier and came up with what eventually would be called the Website Framework, which viewed a website as a hierarchy of content, attributes and scripts, and introduced the concept of rendering, and along with it, macros and the glossary." created="Mon, 08 Apr 2002 15:07:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="All these concepts are still here today, and perhaps even more surprising, so is the implementation. The text you're reading now was rendered through the website framework that was developed in 1996. I think of this as the lizard brain of Frontier, Manila and Radio -- these were the first full steps towards web content management at UserLand, and while we only had a glimpse of what was to come, the work was good enough that we still use it today. Our detractors who say, unfairly, that we don't have an appreciation for continuity at UserLand should consider that website framework apps of 1996 still run in 2002, in the same way that today's web browsers can display sites that were built in 1996." created="Mon, 08 Apr 2002 15:09:18 GMT"/>

So let me try to define what I mean by the term lizard brain. The human brain is a map of evolution. At the base of the brain are the most primitive functions, the unconscious automatic things like regulating breath, the heart, fight or flight, etc. As you go up and forward, the functions advance, and become more human, more conscious. The lizard brain is the part of the brain that we have in common with lizards, a very primitive form of life, compared to humans. " created="Mon, 08 Apr 2002 15:29:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you apply the same evolutionary principles to software, which is totally valid, you can see the layers as they came online. The Frontier 4 glossary was hardly the most primitive part of the system, for that you'd have to go deep into the kernel, and the low-level database functions, the script engine and the outliner, which were the first bits I programmed in 1988. So perhaps more analogously, the glossary of 1996 was really the bird brain of Radio 8. But you get the idea." created="Mon, 08 Apr 2002 15:36:09 GMT"/>

It's not Markoff. He thinks weblogs are the CB radio thing, as his colleague Bob Tedeschi has written. Markoff points out that I have an interest in the outcome. I point out that he does too. By the time the conversation was winding down, I wasn't so sure anymore that we're such a big threat to the pro's. Then Esther's piece came out, as if on cue, because I had just told Markoff that Scripting News is like more an industry conference every day. I get to play Stewart. Now I'm out of his way. Hey I love the way Esther is giving us a chance, she could feel threatened by wireless bloggers, but quite the opposite is happening. Will her conference be different next year? Undoubtedly.

					<outline text="OK, just one more note. I wondered what the NY Times would look like if it were a weblog. So I quickly put together a little app that scrolls the NY Times headlines through a web page based on the XML feeds we're getting, showing the last 24 hours of stories from the Times in reverse-chronologic order. Guess what, they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; releasing stories throughout the day. You couldn't easily tell before because the NY Times home page is like the front page of a daily newspaper. At our dinner in January I pitched Martin on doing this for users. I want to do a bit more finish-up work on this little app before showing it to you. It's very simple. A page you can check every hour to see what's new from the Times. It's so good that it might even be serious competition for this weblog, and all the others.

I don't mind reading the naysayers, but I also want inspiration. " created="Mon, 01 Apr 2002 21:20:23 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="BTW, I felt this was a good idea even when the Web was in flux. I met with Macromedia people shortly after they acquired Flash from Charlie Jackson's company, and encouraged them to, in addition to being a browser plug-in, to also be a browser. Yes, I love the Web, and think that HTML browsers are great, but we have to try multiple paths out, or else we stop learning, and even worse, we drive into cul de sacs where the only way out is through Microsoft. Well, we're there now, fully, so let's try out lots of new ideas, let's see if there are some new tricks we can teach the Internet. " created="Mon, 01 Apr 2002 21:34:51 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.andredurand.com/stories/storyReader$276&quot;&gt;Andre Durand writes&lt;/a&gt; an excellent article about the future of Jabber. I have a slightly different spin. The clients for Jabber will come from desktop apps, like Radio, that integrate Jabber functionality behind a UI. The user will barely be aware the Jabber is the technology that's linking Radio's so that outlines from your buddies update instantly. I had a phone talk this weekend with DJ Adams to talk about how our publish-subscribe system works. We want to use a Jabber server as a proxy for users behind firewalls and NATs. Jabber won't carry the payload, that's in OPML served statically by Apache, but it will percolate pings around the network. I think it's time to write a cheat-sheet that explains how it works. It's really simple, but it's also really twisty." created="Mon, 01 Apr 2002 16:06:44 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="BTW, when I say &quot;Apache&quot; above, you can substitute any static server. It's a short-hand. To me Apache is a lightweight highly optimized app that can blast bits out port 80 without much care and feeding." created="Mon, 01 Apr 2002 16:14:36 GMT" type="outline"/>

If you look to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/2002/04/01/thisdayin.gif&quot;&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;, there's now a new year in the On This Day In section. On this day in 1997 a weblog &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnewsarchive.userland.com/1997/04/01&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt;, for the first time, at www.scripting.com called Scripting News. I had been doing a reverse-chronologic daily page of links &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/news.html&quot;&gt;deep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/outline.html&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; the Frontier site, which was on scripting.com at the time. On 4/1/97 it occurred to me that the new stuff should be on the home page. So I redirected my Frontier CMS to this place and a new weblog and a community got started. The first efforts were pretty humble, and there's lots of linkrot, but that's how things always are when they're getting started." created="Mon, 01 Apr 2002 14:15:26 GMT"/>
