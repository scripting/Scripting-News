I started blogging because the professional journalists carry such huge conflicts, and often don't disclose them. They have to do it to keep their jobs.  Human beings in difficult spots. But as a product developer, I couldn't get news about my products out through them. It got so bad that in 1993 I retired from software. I got back in because quite by accident I discovered that I could create my own waves without help from the pros. Now as a result I am a total hardass when it comes to undisclosed conflicts. Sometimes I lose friends because of this. Comes with the territory. I'm glad Dan is still my friend. I love the guy. I feel his pain, he feels mine. Right on. I still get my nose rubbed in the bullshit of the pros every damned day.

I thought we could just come up with a &quot;flavor&quot; attribute that both forks had in common, but with different values. (Come to think of it, there was a version number attribute on the &lt;rss&gt; element prior to 1.0, why didn't the designers of 1.0 respect that? That's why we bother to put version numbers on formats, they're supposed to be carried forward. Okay I did a bit more digging and it all comes back. The designers of 1.0 wanted to forget that 0.91 happened. 0.91 had the version number, 0.90 didn't. There ought to be a law taught in Format Design 101. Include a version number. Rule number two.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/767146.asp#020821&quot;&gt;To Michael Rogers&lt;/a&gt; who asks how frequently a person writing a weblog should update (I hate calling these people bloggers, as Rogers does, that's a trademark). My answer is As frequently as something happens and you have the time or inclination to write it up. Rogers then says something provocative: &quot;The kind of article that a writer produces after a week of thought is fundamentally different than one produced after a few hours.&quot; True. But you can keep lots of ideas in your head, and think about them for hours, days, weeks, months, years or decades; and even repeat them and expand on them, and (rarely) change your mind about something. Even great writers like Hemingway repeated themes. People who blog do this even more. It helps fill the space. Every event is an opportunity to &quot;prove&quot; ones' pet theories. I do this a lot. It's okay because everyone else does it too. " created="Sun, 25 Aug 2002 14:11:41 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Happy Friday, one and all. Thinking about Lessig's Hemingway story. Also wondering why Lessig's book isn't on the Web, so we can read &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; code. So many mealy-mouthed advocates for this guy. That's kind of a clue. They believe in Free Software. All of them paid $21 to read Lessig. Let me know when you get that to parse. (Would they pay the money if they could read it for free on the Web?)"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I don't trust people who tell me that Hemingway reveals all his source code when nothing could be further from the truth. A writer of prose reveals the final copy and nothing more. He doesn't reveal the life experiences that taught him the lessons that the book teaches. He doesn't tell you which ideas he stole from other books he read. He omits all the blind alleys and dead ends, the characters and plot ideas that didn't make the cut. The novelist omits the text of all previous books, and that's interesting because many if not all authors write the same book over and over, refinining it, narrowing the focus, taking stuff out, amplifying and discussing. Some of my favorite authors work that way. Bottom-line, despite what Lessig says, there's no full disclosure in art." created="Fri, 23 Aug 2002 14:00:47 GMT"/>

Smell of smoke all around. It smells good. I really want one. In my mind I outline the steps it would take to be smoking and the amount of time it would take. I would ask someone if they could spare a cigarette. If they said no I'd offer them $1. Oh hell, just offer $1 to begin with. Whoo, where would I get a match. I'd ask for a light. Take a drag. Estimated time, 15 seconds to one minute to first nicotine rush. My heart started beating faster. I felt scared like you feel on a NY subway platform as a train is entering the station and you're standing on the platform and in the instant before it passes you think how you could end your life by leaning forward. I never actually jump, and that night I didn't smoke, and it's good that inside I equate smoking with death so deeply that it invokes my subway nightmare. Do I have it beat? No way. I am still an addict, I expect I will be for life. But I'm an addict in recovery, who is not taking the drug.

					<outline text="First I don't have a good pointer to a Web page explaining his proposal, so I'm having to do this from memory. I'm not going to buy his book because I don't want to give him any money because I find what he wants so unsupportable. If you've read his book, and if I've got his proposal wrong, please send me a correction. Thanks." created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:10:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's the deal. Lessig would limit copyright to ten years, and force developers to put source code in escrow. After the copyright expires the source code goes into the public domain. " created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:13:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now of course we don't have to do that now. If the customers placed a sufficiently high value on having access to source code, or if they felt our copyrights lasted too long, of course we would have to do what they want us to, or retire from the market. So the proponents of this plan are trying to legislate what they haven't been able to gain in the market. It's a weak position for that reason." created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:14:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Second, it comes at a pretty bad time in the software business, which has been reeling from the idea that what we produce should all be free. Right now, in mid-2002, we're getting back on track, there's a general consensus developing that if we want to have a technology industry, users are going to have to pay. Given enough time that will lead to profitable products, and investment. But right now we're weak. There's no investment in software, hasn't really been any investment in a decade (the investors were buying marketing people, ads on TV, lots of stuff that produced no new software). Why attack such a weak industry, and one that is probably very vital to the health of our economy?" created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:15:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="After giving it a bunch of thought, I think Lessig is going after the BigCo's, probably Microsoft. But he would also sacrifice the independent companies. If we have to publish our source code the users won't pay for it. Ten years isn't enough time to create a new market. So you wouldn't get any commercial innovation in this system. The BigCo's don't innovate. " created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:17:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, I don't buy the idea that Lessig's plan is granting me anything that I'm not entitled to, at no charge, by the US Constitution and the First Amendment. But of course I'm as much of a legal neophyte as Lessig is a software neophyte. " created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:22:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One final thought, to those who think there are two camps here, the good guys (Lessig, open source advocates, small creative developers) and the bad guys (Eisner, Redstone, Spielberg, Feinstein, Berman, Coble, Rosen, Valenti) -- think again. I have a lot of interests in common with the people you think are bad. I believe in financial compensation for creative people. Where I diverge from the entertainment industry is that they don't pay the artists. That's their basic weakness. (Also as a user of their product, I don't like that they're so anti-user, so unwilling to give me what I want, or even listen to their users.)" created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:23:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I am a capitalist and proud of it. And I also believe in the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Perhaps Lessig and his friends are well intentioned, I don't know what the thought process is, and I don't care. They've got a gun to the head of my art and business. We can't talk as long as they have that position. Withdraw, and then let's get to know each other and see what we have in common." created="Thu, 22 Aug 2002 13:33:17 GMT"/>

It's a bit snooty, but what the heck, we're big boys. It's good to see the professor use the medium. By the end of the piece we're in agreement. The most powerful tool we have is the vote. And while he's a newbie to weblogs, it's the most powerful way to route around the media monopoly owned by our common opponents. It's also the key to self-governance, don't overlook the power of representatives who take responsibility for communicating every day with the people who elect them.

They'll go to Google and do a search, and Ray's review will show up. They'll observe that the review has typos and mis-spellings, and therefore conclude that it's authentic, it comes from a real person, not a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=shill&quot;&gt;shill&lt;/a&gt;.

Offer the same service that Morpheus and Kazaa operate, with high quality scans, and a $50 monthly fee. Run an ad campaign aimed at parents, saying that this is the responsible and honest thing for their families to do. Give Mom and Dad an easy way to spend a few bucks on the kids' happiness (and find some of their favorite oldies too). Promise to get &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of the money to flow to the artists. Everyone says &quot;In the end, Hillary did the right thing.&quot; You must know in your heart it's going to end this way, so you might as well do it sooner than later. BTW, you gotta apologize before any of this. People who use music on the Internet don't think of themselves as pirates, and every time you repeat it in a press release you're building negative goodwill. When you ask the parents to do the right thing, first you have to show that you're willing to do it too. The facts are out. You keep all the money for yourselves. The artists get nothing. You care not one whit about the art, on either side of the equation. That's the insult. That has to be dealt with.

Crawford plays a housewife turned entrepreneur, who builds an empire to win the heart of her daughter. Eve Arden plays her business partner. What was different about the feminism of 1945, at least expressed in Mildred Pierce, is that it was respectful of men. " created="Tue, 13 Aug 2002 13:44:05 GMT"/>

Sidney Poitier's mother gives the pivotal speech of the movie, castigating Tracy for forgetting the passion of his youth. The leading man of the 60s, even on his way out, had a brilliance, a twinkle in his eye. Tracy gets to give his own eulogy, and it's spectacular. People who were close to the filming of Guess Who speculate that his closing speech, where he remembers his love of Hepburn, wasn't really acting. It's a beautiful movie, a little dated perhaps, but that's okay. It was balanced.

Go see it. I'm only going to talk about a couple of scenes. First scene. The wife is beating her husband. Kicking. Hitting. He's in a fetal position. He's really hurt. Bleeding. For the rest of the movie his face is cut and bruised. A few scenes later. Water coming out the door of the bathroom. The wife bashes in the door. Finds the husband sitting upright in the tub. Razor in his hand and vacant stare. She kisses him passionately, petting, saying how much she loves him. Very bizarre. I try to imagine a gender reversal.

Ray says that Lotus didn't need to be cross-platform (ie run on the Apple II and various weird almost PC clones) to kick VisiCalc's butt. That's soooo true. The PC was a juggernaut, and Mitch learned all you could learn about shoehorning apps into the Apple II's limited memory. VC was probably the best spreadsheet you could do on the Apple II, no oppty to challenge there. And Notes didn't really mean much on the Mac (I remember it was a big deal, but who uses Notes on the Mac). But (there always is one of those) I wonder if there aren't too many Windowsisms in the Groove code base today (4.5 million lines according to Ray) and if they had another version on another OS if those would be there. I know that we got going on XML-RPC and SOAP because we &lt;i&gt;needed&lt;/i&gt; it, we had Windows and Mac code bases that needed to talk to each other. More to think about.

Two people can see the same movie, and see two completely different things. Consider The Pledge, starring a very old Jack Nicholson and directed by Sean Penn. It's a poignant movie about truth and trust. I don't want to give away the plot or the ending, but it's dark, and to me, really rings true, in the same way As Good As It Gets spoke for me. Lately I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moviemantz.com/movie_reviews/101/the_pledge.html&quot;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popmatters.com/film/reviews/p/pledge.html&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moviemansguide.homestead.com/pledge.html&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; seeing movies and reading books, instead of before.

He is an advocate of a particular scripting language, on that's got a loyal following, but it's not one of the huge languages, like Perl or Java; but it's not small either. We were talking about the Seybold keynote on web services. I've got my cast pretty well set, but I was interested in having this person demo some kind of SOAP or XML-RPC app with his scripting language. No matter how we approached it, he was always trying to sell his scripting language, which of course is okay, but later this struck me as totally at odds with the philosophy of web services.

And when I meet users that's what they value the most, no lock-in, ease of movement and migration of code. The only ones who don't see it this way are the big companies and their followers who snicker about choice issues, and assume everyone wants to use the environment they use or will want to once they are assimilated. Emphatically, these people are not using the Web, and they might as well use their own language's native mechanism for cross-network communication, they gain &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; by using a protocol that's supported in lots of languages and environments. Yes, I am naive, and I choose to be that way. I understand that sometimes people pretend to support choice, when they really just want to confuse people, or keep them arguing about small details while they take over the world, but I hold them to a higher standard. Let's dispense, once and for all, of these monsters. If you can't handle competition, get out of the kitchen. You know what I mean." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:38:33 GMT"/>

					<outline text="People like to give me a hard time for writing in real time on Scripting News. I can do this because I use a different kind of tool to write. Someday this tool will be more popular and lots of people will do what I do, and it will drive certain people (you know who you are) out of their minds. See, sometimes when writing in this mode, something that's not politically correct, or inadvertently not politically correct, sneaks out. Shit happens. Before I can correct it, some blogger somewhere has launched a holy jihad and is experiencing the rush of body chemistry that comes from it. And then I spot the bit of vulnerability (sometimes it's just a spelling or grammatical mistake or an awkward wording) and make the change and save it, and oops, the flamer has nothing to flame about. There's a bit of a fallacy in their ire, because they don't have to give back the endorphins, but maybe they're hoping for a double-dip. I have many new assholes cut in this manner.

					<outline text="The human mind is a wonderful thing. It's capable of doing math, writing poetry and love letters, and can save your life when called on. It's great to have a mind, but sometimes it lies to you. The mind can't handle not knowing something. It strings assumptions across voids of knowledge. You can see Nick Denton do this a couple of days ago, when he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/2002_08_01_archive.htm#85316636&quot;&gt;assumed&lt;/a&gt; that a comment I made on SN was about Muslims becoming perpetrators of the next holocaust. It could happen, but I think it's more likely we're headed there in the US. That our country would consider attacking Iraq for the reason Denton outlines, to induce humiliation in the Muslim world, and that intelligent people like Reynolds think this is a good idea, makes me worry more about our country than any other. We're so poorly defended here, before we attack so mindlessly, give some thought to how many Americans would die at home for this kind of bluster overseas. Like so many armchair strategists, Denton and Reynolds want to fight the last war we won (WW II) but it ain't going to work that way. Anyway, I think this is why we don't get too much support from our allies in Europe. They're scared of the US, rightfully, and so am I." created="Wed, 07 Aug 2002 15:09:19 GMT"/>

We have the freedom to express ourselves, guaranteed by the Constitution, and that guaratees that we will hear ideas that sound wrong, that we disagree with, that stimulate writing and hopefully thinking (maybe not in that order). As long as that's all that happens, it makes us safer. I've seen people say that Denton's comments are dangerous. So far, only to my belief system, and that's a danger I welcome with open arms. But we have to watch for the messengers of &quot;It can't happen here,&quot; because a lot of the first steps down the road to erasing our freedoms start there.

As you may know, Jon Udell took a job at InfoWorld, as a columnist with an agent provacateur sideline. His mission: to get the content of InfoWorld to start to flow out through weblogs. This was deliberate, I am told, by Steve Gillmor, who hired Jon. Most InfoWorlders don't know much about weblogs, but the management is curious, probably a bit more than curious. So today, they will take a step down a path that (I think) will eventually turn InfoWorld into a fully-weblog-enabled publication, with their first blog, authored by Jon Udell, of course. Now to a Scripting News reader this is hardly earth-shaking. It means that &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/&quot;&gt;Jon's url changed&lt;/a&gt;. BFD, right? But now the InfoWorld readers (and reporters, columnists, editors, sales people and management) are going to be reading and hearing about weblogs from one of the best in the techblogger community. What's next? More InfoWorld weblogs, of course! After that, I'll take Pat McGovern to lunch and talk about the good old days and &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2002/05/07/howToStartAWeblogforProfessionalJournalists&quot;&gt;the bright future&lt;/a&gt;." created="Tue, 06 Aug 2002 19:19:24 GMT"/>

But enough people know about computer viruses, I think, to allow for a direct explanation, which might go something like this. &quot;Computer viruses are dangerous, they can delete files, disclose private or sensitive data, and can even be used for terrorism on a global scale. Even if the entertainment industry feels that it can write a 'safe' virus (they haven't promised they will, btw), software always has bugs, and a bug in a virus could be devastating, not just to people who use music on the Internet, but for all people who depend on computers for their livelihood, or for medical care or education. Computer technology is used for many important things that have nothing to do with listening to music or watching movies. We can't let the entertainment industry dictate how our computers are used, or take control of our computers, or destroy their utility. We paid for our computers, not them.&quot; Okay, I know the wording is awkard, but there are a lot of ideas that aren't getting through in the articles about the Hollywood hacking bill." created="Sun, 04 Aug 2002 17:13:31 GMT"/>

However, there's one bit of pushback that really needs to get out there. There's a lot more to commercial software than Microsoft. To the extent that people frame the conversation as Microsoft or open source, they cripple the non-monopolist commercial vendors. Apple, for example is neither Microsoft or open source. Nor is IBM, Macromedia, Adobe, Oracle, Sun, AOL. And weblogs, like the one you're reading now, are generally managed with software that neither comes from Microsoft or open source developers. Now you may think either MS or OS will crush us, but stop and think, do you really &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; that to happen? Would you prefer that independent developers be able to make a living writing software? I know, Eric Raymond told you that there were other ways to make money developing software. Unfortunately, those techniques &lt;i&gt;don't work&lt;/i&gt; for end-user software, the easy to use stuff, for individual people. The only thing that works there is developers charging users for the product. We can afford to give you a lot of source, but not all of it." created="Sun, 04 Aug 2002 20:12:37 GMT"/>

He said that a couple of years after his surgery, the artery blockages were coming back (how depressing), but so far he hasn't needed more surgery. The difference? Smoking.

In the late 90s open source defined a club that excluded many well-intentioned hard-working developers. Now it no longer has the power to do that, because the hype is over, and the money that was funding it is gone. So if open source, as a cause, tries to pretend that the barriers still exist, you only cut yourself out of the mainstream, and become more and more irrelevant. And here's the most important point. There's lots of work to do. In Washington they're passing laws that any developer, whether or not he or she develops open source, should be working to stop. The fact is that if you use a computer, you probably depend on some of both kinds of software -- so stop seeing the world so black and white, stop seeing an enemy in anyone who dares criticize the most bizarre zealotry, relax, and see that the world is a lot bigger than it may have seemed, and let's work together for real freedom, for all of us.
