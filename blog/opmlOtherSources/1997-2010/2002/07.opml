Seriously, the suspension of disbelief is blown when the lawyers take over. How cold of the Mets to shut down young Bryan and his friends. I really have been a fan since 1962. The Mets are a young team, too young to screw around this way. On the subway, coming home &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/26&quot;&gt;after Game 5&lt;/a&gt; of the Subway Series, I heard an older man say to a young Mets fan who was in tears -- &quot;Son, if you're going to be a Mets fan your heart is going to get broken, a lot.&quot; The Mets &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; break your heart, every time. That's why we care. When the Mets win, it means something, for all of us. I loved the Mets without reservation when I was a boy (I'm 47 now).

Like Bryan Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money. The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major League Baseball. If you go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metsonline.net/metsonline-ceaseanddesist.html&quot;&gt;deeper&lt;/a&gt; you see that Hoch contributed his time for free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing." created="Tue, 30 Jul 2002 14:11:28 GMT" type="outline"/>

Double-click. How do you write about a book about the Web if it isn't on the Web? All you can do is write a very short review, unless you want to try to explain what the book is saying. Well, writing for weblogs doesn't work that way. I want to link to the source so you can read for yourself &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what they're saying, not my paraphrasing of it. If all I can do is link to a page where you can buy the book, well, okay, I'll do that once or maybe twice, but if it's on the Web, and indexed by search engines, it can come up over and over. So I think the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogroots.com/&quot;&gt;BlogRoots&lt;/a&gt; folks did the right thing. Their book will be studied, examined, probed and questioned by the weblog community, as they release chapters on a regular basis over the coming weeks. Will their book sell? We'll find out when it's published. I'll buy a copy to support the idea of books being dual-published on the Web and in print. It's a good idea, in general, but it's essential for books about the Web." created="Thu, 25 Jul 2002 15:43:57 GMT" type="outline"/>

With all possible humility, if they want to get going in a productive direction with this stuff, let's reconvene the group that started the work in 1998, and plot out the next steps. No doubt the development and runtime environment that MS has developed in the interim will play a role, but there's more to it, and less, than Microsoft said there is, two years ago.

Two years ago Microsoft started making a lot of claims about .NET including some specific ship dates and features, that they have missed. Paul isn't responsible for explaining to readers the why's and wherefore's, and it's good that he is checking up on their delivery, so perhaps next time big companies like MS make grand proclamations about their dominance, they'll be taken with a few more grains of salt, and not clear the landscape of all innovation until they ship, or fail to. It's happened over and over. Paul has been around the loop enough to have seen it a few times.

Briefly, to recount. The bubble of the 90s was due to misdirected enthusiasm over technology. AOL, a leader, hasn't kept pace. Microsoft will overtake them if they don't refocus on giving new features and performance to users. The music industry, of which AOL is a major player, holds some if not all of the keys. They refuse to use them to give the users what they want. AOL should also be investing heavily in writable-web technology. When we look back five years from now, after MS forecloses on the music industry for pennies on the dollar, we'll realize that AOL, like Netscape, actually had the lead when it capitulated. If anyone at AOL understands this it's Steve Case. I wonder if anyone is listening to him there.

Jorn Barger, the person credited with coining the term &quot;weblog&quot; used the NewsPage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/newsPage.html&quot;&gt;suite&lt;/a&gt; in Frontier, he didn't do his weblog by hand as Hiler says. It's possible that Jorn still uses Frontier. I suspect there are (many) other factual errors in this very long piece, but I also suspect that Hiler would be willing to correct them. The source of many of his errors appears to be Rebecca Blood's history of weblogs, which he references and points to.

I appreciate the effort he and others are putting into this. On Friday I spoke with the people at Amazon who did their Web Services &lt;a href=&quot;http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/1067662/104-5410121-1831939&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt;. I said they did a Good Thing by giving the REST folk what they wanted, and also giving the SOAP folk what they wanted. The actual interfaces matter not one bit. The goal is to enable developers to build apps on your services.

					<outline text="I got a briefing yesterday from some Microsoft people on Palladium. It was an interesting but depressing meeting. They're putting a lot of effort into something that no one I know wants. There are few if any developers to validate the idea. Any developer with a mind is going to stay out of Microsoft's program, remembering this is the company that cuts off the air supply of its successful developers. This is a tragedy, because MS is a PR-conscious company, that at its core probably wants developers, but in the heat of their war with Netscape and Sun, and then the DOJ, forgot their mission and lost their way. Now the software business is a wrecked landscape. They're producing products as if it were not. That won't work." created="Sat, 20 Jul 2002 13:06:18 GMT"/>

I rarely make predictions, at least in public. Last November I had all my liquid assets in stocks, and I sold them, turning them into cash, in US dollars, locking in some substantial losses. At first, it was not a good decision, but in the last few weeks I've come to appreciate it. I saved a lot of money. Today I had a flash that the market is at or near its bottom now. I don't think it's going to go up very quickly, but I think the precipitous fall is over. We've factored in the lack of trust of management of companies. Greenspan's comments, referenced &lt;a href=&quot;#When:9:23:36AM&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;, really made a difference to me. From this point we'll get much better information about how the companies are doing. Stock options are over. Salaries and benefits matter. Transparent management. Time to ride the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cluetrain.com/&quot;&gt;Cluetrain&lt;/a&gt;, for real. Companies that make identifiable products for real people that they communicate with.

Off to the glue factory. Meanwhile the general stagnation in the software industry, which is the core the western economy now, is a huge problem, and people aren't even talking about it. We're stuck behind a horribly inefficient system for trying out new ideas. A Hollywood movie gets &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more funding than a breakthrough software idea.

Then I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/16#theTrancefesttradeContinues&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; why there were no women in the picture. More stories.

Health insurance (apparently) won't pay for it. What kind of sense does that make. The diseases caused by smoking are expensive, the cure -- not so expensive. Maybe they're owned by the tobacco industry? Next. Smoking is not as hard to quit as they tell you it is. The first week is relatively difficult, while your body is dealing with the physical addiction, and then it gets a lot easier. In a sense I was lucky, being hospitalized, with no way to get a cigarette, made the physical part easy. Now why can't people check into a nicotine detox resort for a month where you get pampered with vitamins, juices, exercise and massage, hot tubs, great scenery, and &lt;i&gt;no way to get a cigarette.&lt;/i&gt; My doctor's advice was ridiculous.

To me, this is like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=fresco&quot;&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt; painting, and books are much more permanent. Have there been any books about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burningman.com/&quot;&gt;Burning Man&lt;/a&gt;? How would you write a book about something that looks so different from every angle. That is the main failure of Blood's Blog Books, and of course is no fault of hers. When she looks at blogs she sees the weblogs she knows; and misses the enormity of the medium. It's my opinion that anyone who attempts to write a book about weblogs will miss the point in this way. Perhaps it's the impossibility of writing a book about it that makes the medium so interesting.

All the cries for reform from the journalists are a convenient form of finger-pointing that draws the attention away from them. Yeah, sure the boards of directors of the companies should have been watching management more carefully, it was their job to do that and they fell down. It wasn't really Dubya's job, as the governor of Texas, to be watching this. Sure he's a dirty man, he's profited from the slackish rules. But the press was supposed to be blowing the whistle then, and instead were playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=footsy&quot;&gt;footsy&lt;/a&gt; with the CEOs just like the board members and the accounting firms. That came home to me, reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&amp;doc_id=208505&quot;&gt;latest issue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fortune.com/&quot;&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; with Bill Gates on the cover (they say he's achieved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=serene&quot;&gt;serenity&lt;/a&gt;, oh sure, give me a fucking break). The journalists of the 1990s were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=lapdog&amp;r=3&quot;&gt;lapdogs&lt;/a&gt; for the CEO du jour, they still are, even though the CEOs are going down down down." created="Sun, 14 Jul 2002 16:24:27 GMT" type="outline"/>

It was Rod Steiger day on TCM. The movie, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shopping.yahoo.com/shop?d=v&amp;id=1800074684&quot;&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/a&gt;, was about a journalist who lost his job and decided to get dirty to make some money as a boxing publicist. That was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blockbuster.com/bb/person/details/0,4487,BIO-P++7027,00.html&quot;&gt;Bogart&lt;/a&gt;. The fight promoter was played by Steiger. Bogie's wife was a weak clone of Lauren Bacall. Bogie looked older, but not that sick. He died of cancer shortly after the movie was completed. I guess in those days, before chemotherapy, you looked okay before you died of cancer. It was a good movie. The last Bogart scene was also a good one. He blows the whistle on the corruption.

					<outline text="One of Blood's theses is that there's been too much focus on the software. A year ago I might have agreed, but today I think that all that blogs have in common is the a reverse chronologic structure, with a calender; links and comments. It's a structure to hang ideas on. Much the way a spreadsheet is a structure, or an outliner or a word processor (although structure in a wp is a looser thing).

They put enough time into it (the O'Reilly book was a rush job) and they (appear to) have the right premise. It would have been possible for a philosophical book to have lasting value, but to do so, they should have gotten a social butterfly to edit it, one who crosses all the lines with ease, someone who likes everyone and who everyone likes, but somehow doesn't have to kiss ass to do it.

If it doesn't support robots.txt, first raise the issue in public, and the tech weblogs will get right on it. If that doesn't work, add a simple script to your server to look at the referer attribute on the HTTP request and if it isn't from your site, redirect to your deep linking policy page.

				<outline text="I should write a FAQ about arguing with Microsoft and how not to fall into their trap, as Mitch Wagner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drive-thru.org/2002_07_01_archive.html#85221579&quot;&gt;does here&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the first question that would be in the FAQ. Why is it pointless to argue with Microsoft people? Answer: because they hold you to a higher moral standard than they themselves support. When discussing their transgressions, they argue that they have the right to do that. They overstate your case and rebut that, leaving you stuttering &quot;But I didn't say that.&quot; If that doesn't work, they question your objectivity or qualifications, or resort to veiled ad hominems (a quick subject-change). It's very disgusting. I used to fall for it all the time, arguing with them as if they were willing to be convinced, when they want nothing of the sort. They want to confuse you and tire you out until you give up. So I don't argue with them anymore, I just form my opinion, state it, and don't worry if I'm being terribly fair to them, because they clearly don't worry about being fair to anyone else, including me (and you)." created="Thu, 04 Jul 2002 20:07:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

Newspaper people, once celebrated as founts of ribald humor and uncouth fun, have of late lost all their gaiety, and small wonder. They have discovered that their prime duty is no longer to maintain the republic in well-informed conditionor to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, as the old gospel has itbut to serve the stock market with a good earnings report every three months or, in plainer English, to comfort the comfortable.&quot;" created="Wed, 03 Jul 2002 00:42:40 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Meltdowns at Enron and WorldCom. Yesterday a board revolt at Vivendi, a media company, and the CEO is toast. What happens when one of the owners of one of the major TV networks becomes the target of a business scandal. Viacom, Disney, GE, AOL. Who will be first to go down? But will the reporters go there? Heh. Why is everyone so surprised. Didn't they know that BigCo's have no integrity or ethics. Where were they for the last ten years? We all didn't care too much as long as the stock prices were going up. Sure they're lying everyone knew they were. So what's new. Just as blogs are the cure for integrity outages at the BigPubs, LittleCo's will be our haven from the excesses of the idiots who run the BigCo's. Microbusinesses and microcontent. Hey it's cool that people seem to require integrity of their business leaders. How are the current crop going to compete. They didn't teach integrity at b-school.

				<outline text="Nick Denton surely is looking for some kind of pushback or maybe just a kick in the butt. Yesterday he posted an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/2002_07_01_archive.htm#85212546&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; saying that blogs were never going to equal the pro's because some of us take vacations, or (in my case) ease up when recovering from major surgery (getting better every day, btw, still no cigs). Then today he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/2002_07_01_archive.htm#85215386&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the bubble may have burst, implying that blogs were a creation of massive media hype. Nick, you're so fucking wrong. First, blogs exist independently of the ink-stained media, they can hype us or not, it makes no difference either way. Second, there isn't much going on right now, so why not take a break. Third, if you think blogs are about a handful of people like Glenn Reynolds, etc etc, you have &lt;i&gt;completely missed the point,&lt;/i&gt; and need to go back for re-education on the very concept you're writing about. All of the A-Team bloggers could quit tomorrow, and the thing &lt;i&gt;would keep going.&lt;/i&gt; It'll make a difference next time there's a big story that we need triangulation on. On Sept 11, the first-hand accounts from amateurs with keyboards, telephones, digital cameras, friends/relatives at the scene, were just a demo of what's coming in the next few years. It's the massive number of people distributed over the planet that can cover a story as the shrinking budgets and conflicted interest of the pros constrict the amount of news they can carry. It's circulation and distribution. Blogs are bypasses for information, like the Internet routes around outages, just at a higher level. Thanks for listening. The most amazing thing to me (after all this is a weblog) is that I wrote that with absolutely no nicotine. " created="Tue, 02 Jul 2002 15:37:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
