When it started it had a minimalist approach. The home page was stark and fast, in contrast to the jumbles that the early search engines were turning into. That made a strong statement. I liked it. When they hired a CEO, an exec who had presided over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigburton.com/2002/02/26&quot;&gt;demise&lt;/a&gt; of Novell, I started watching for what I feared was coming -- that Google would become just another diluted and inanely-run Silicon Valley company. Maybe Google-the-Company was never that good, it's hard to know, but Google-the-Search-Engine was and is perfect. As long as they don't screw with that I'm happy, I guess. But truth be told, I wanted them to be more like the Web, not less. I feel the same way about &lt;a href=&quot;http://toolbar.google.com/dc/faq_dc.html&quot;&gt;Google Compute&lt;/a&gt; as I did when Amazon went from being the Earth's Largest Bookstore, to being Earth's Largest Everything, and then (of course) Nothing Interesting At All." created="Thu, 28 Feb 2002 23:44:14 GMT" type="outline"/>

Not everyone knows everyone else, but if any of it comes to fruition there are going to be a lot more Radio users soon. &quot;A nice problem to have,&quot; you might think, and I agree, but -- to turn the next corner, we have to package the cloud-side of Radio, so that other organizations can run their own communities. To do that we have to bootstrap a new community, so we can test the software. Corner-turns and bootstraps are the hardest things about what we do.

					<outline text="Radio is our desktop product, it includes weblogging software, a news aggregator, and features that put a friendly face on XML-based services over the Internet.

Where Radio is designed for individuals, Frontier is designed for communities and organizations, workgroups -- groups of people.

				<outline text="One more note before signing off for the night. One of the advantages the pros are supposed to have over amateurs is the time and skills they have to carefully research a topic. According to the legend, weblog people shoot from the hip, there's no time to research. This is an incorrect idea. In fact the best webloggers are &lt;b&gt;domain experts&lt;/b&gt;. They spend their whole professional lives gathering knowledge and experience in their fields. A fantastic example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.glennf.com/gmblog/&quot;&gt;Glenn Fleishman&lt;/a&gt;, who pours his intelligence out to the Web in vast quantities. He doesn't take any shortcuts. The quality of his writing, and his integrity is in your face. Another example, with all possible humility, I've spent 25 years becoming an expert in several areas of software development. When I write about software, really, there's nothing shallow about it. I've got the scars to prove it. I wonder when some reporter is going to connect XML-RPC, SOAP, RSS and Radio to my weblog. Could any of these things have happened without the ability to communicate directly to users and developers? Don't they see the economic revolution. We've cut out a middleman who was subtracting value. It must be hard for them to see because &lt;i&gt;the reporters&lt;/i&gt; are the middlemen. How can you explain a new idea when the reporters won't believe or even express the ideas behind the software. Therefore no new ideas get out. Until the Web.

But there are probably 100 bloggers who could write a more insightful and accurate story about weblogs than Tedeschi's. Here's why the economics work. People want more info, not less. But the BigPubs are laying off reporters as their business model erodes. Weblogs fill the void. DIY. From that premise, interview some analysts and some technology vendors.

The Times says &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; did not break rule 2, because they trusted the writer, and fact-checking was difficult given the subject matter. They said something that wasn't true, but they didn't know. But when they found out they fired the author. &quot;The Times's policies prohibit falsifying a news account or using fictional devices in factual material.

And people are less likely to whine in their own lonely space.

It's also bothered me that they're so willing to kick MS's competitors in the butt. If I were Omni I'd be pretty pissed off. Yesterday Robert Occhialini &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0100237/2002/02/21.html#a1234&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; we need another browser that we can love, not just Microsoft's. Ideally we should be able to love a dozen browsers. Not that that would ever get MS to love the Web, I don't think it's in their genes." created="Fri, 22 Feb 2002 15:38:19 GMT"/>

Saying someone is an amateur doesn't mean they're inexperienced or the work is low quality. It simply means they don't do it for pay. A long time ago Olympic atheletes had to be amateurs. It was considered a higher calling, people who do something just to be excellent, not to make money. Pros inherit conflicts of interest from the people who pay them.

Coming one week after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-1001-836803.html?tag=dd.ne.dht.nl-sty.0&quot;&gt;rollout&lt;/a&gt; of Visual Studio.Net, after consistent statements by Microsoft execs that .Net is a new beginning for Microsoft, a new development platform, the next thing after Windows, the next thing after the browser, etc. What does MS want developers to do now? Has anything changed? Is interop still a goal for them? If so, what does interop mean? The crucial question is about APIs. Is Microsoft building a new environment, or are they limiting themselves to the widely deployed but not Internet-based Windows APIs? Will .Net go the way of MSIE, integrated with the operating system, inseparable, tied up, bundled, controlled, submitted, just another feature of Windows -- or is there some opportunity, in Microsoft's view, for innovation from developers outside MS and outside the Windows operating system?" created="Wed, 20 Feb 2002 16:17:06 GMT" type="outline"/>

I got my picture taken today for an award I'm getting that hasn't been announced yet. I'm not gloating. OK just a little. Anyway, the two founders of Google are getting the same award. I gave the photographers my card to give to the Google guys (they're shooting them on Wednesday). I told them that I want to build new features for writers using a distributed architecture, and I want to experiment a little before even thinking about licensing terms. I asked them to tell Sergey and Larry this story. A little might get lost in the translation, but one of the photographers knows what XML is. The sub-message.

With the jackpot at $193 million, I guess people wanted a chance to make all that money. I wondered why, so I asked. &quot;Oh I'd give money to all my friends,&quot; one friend said to me. &quot;They'd hate you then,&quot; I said. She didn't get it. Perhaps it doesn't make sense at first, but then I heard a report on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kcbs.com/pages/kcbs/home/home_index.nsp?&quot;&gt;KCBS&lt;/a&gt;, they were interviewing people at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/kpix/20020218/lo/2495_1.html&quot;&gt;Half Moon Bay&lt;/a&gt; supermarket where one of the winning tickets was sold. &quot;What would you do if a friend of yours won?&quot; the reporter asked. &quot;I'd kill them,&quot; blurted the woman he was interviewing. I'm sure she wouldn't actually kill the person, but the anger sounded real. I suppose if someone earns their wealth the hatred isn't as deep, but most people don't really think anyone earns that much money, not like you earn a paycheck or a diploma. And of course the lottery is pure luck. That much money divides you from almost everyone you know. In a sense, that's what money is for, to buy distance.

First, as has been pointed out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flightpath.com/2002/02/16.html&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, Silicon Valley and San Francisco are two very different places. I live in Silicon Valley. Urban folk are often surprised, when they look closely, at how beautiful the environment is here, if you get off the valley floor and venture into the hills. If you live here for a while, it gets into your blood. When I go to NY or London, two incredibly great cities, I miss the physical and spiritual beauty of this place. If I visited SV I would dream about living here. That's point number one. 2. If you want schooling in the art of technology entrepreneurship, there's no better place in the world than Silicon Valley. I came here in 1979, wanting to make great software products. This place is to software what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/memphis.html&quot;&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; is to the blues. It's a magnet. When I arrived here, the generation of 1960's entrepreneurs, the gray beards of that day, were here, and you just had to find them (took me a few years) and they're happy to share what they learned, for the sheer joy of intelligent ambitious young minds. If you came here looking for just another city, you'd find it lacking. But if you came here looking to shake up the world with great software, you'd find it vibrant, interesting, challenging, and the only place to be." created="Mon, 18 Feb 2002 15:18:20 GMT" type="outline"/>

What Microsoft is hailing as a Hailstorm of innovations, Radio has probably already delivered the basic tools for only $39.&quot;" created="Sun, 17 Feb 2002 14:03:44 GMT"/>

					<outline text="&lt;/a&gt;Yesterday Dann Sheridan &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001134/2002/02/16.html&quot;&gt;shipped&lt;/a&gt; something very cool for Radio -- a way to do dynamic browser-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=949071&quot;&gt;dashboards&lt;/a&gt; that link into the core of Radio's XML engine. There isn't a lot of software in Dann's release, but it's still a breakthrough. Talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrobb.userland.com&quot;&gt;John Robb&lt;/a&gt; on Friday I asked if this wasn't just a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=gimmick&amp;r=2&quot;&gt;gimmick&lt;/a&gt;. Before I finished asking the question I realized that it wasn't, any more than the features we put into Radio that make it easy for first-timers to ignore the engine and focus on the interface that Steve Gillmor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/02/18/020218opcurve.xml&quot;&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; &quot;placid&quot; were gimmicks. At UserLand we call those John Robb Features, things the engineers wouldn't think of because we're too accustomed to crawling around in the complexity of the environment. Dann is a Radio newbie, at a programming level, and he's given us a key John Robb Feature for the future. Yes for some people refreshing the page is too much to expect. A readout that refreshes on its own lowers the barrier one more inch, letting even more people in. And it's a feature an engineer could learn to love too. Imagine a log, displaying on the machine next to you, and to find out what's going on there you just have to look at the machine -- you don't have to find the mouse, find the Refresh icon, click it and wait. Steps saved even for those in the know are still steps saved." created="Sun, 17 Feb 2002 13:37:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another sign of developers supporting Radio as a platform is the work being done by Seth Dillingham and Brian Andresen at Macrobyte. With Radio at $40, and the economy so tough, they're going to do something bold -- they're going to release &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.free-conversant.com/about/index&quot;&gt;Conversant&lt;/a&gt; for Radio 8 and Frontier. It's a very powerful environment for doing Web apps. At the same time, they've released as an early beta, a tool that allows Radio and Frontier to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tls.macrobyte.net/&quot;&gt;communicate securely&lt;/a&gt; over HTTPS. What a gift. I understand that we're going to be able to distribute this work, once it's done, as part of the core release of both Radio and Frontier, so Murphy-willing, we'll all be able to communicate securely, shortly. There's a caveat though, this is only the client side of HTTPS, we still have to get it working in our server software. " created="Sun, 17 Feb 2002 13:42:22 GMT"/>

Too bad. Because if you're a soldier in a cause and you want to win, you have to look at the weak spots just as carefully as you do the strengths.

Google started as The People's Search Engine, but they were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease1.html&quot;&gt;funded&lt;/a&gt; by the same VC that funded Netscape, so it's reasonable to expect that they'll get lost in the same way Netscape did. (I hope not, we need Google.) Eric Schmidt, their new CEO, is a total Silicon Valley insider, ex-of-Sun, so his natural first step is to drive Google into the same market that Sun is in, The Enterprise, which is what the $25-250K appliance is designed for. That's a front-door sell, and of course Google can do that, because they are so credible in search. But what if they had chosen the back-door instead?

					<outline text="I was writing about syndication, our first steps in that direction, in late 1997, and how they were bearing first fruit in the winter of 1999. Now, in 2002, syndicated XML from amateur journalists is common, not mainstream yet, but soon it will be. That's the process of Scripting News. The stuff that appears here, written by me, UserLand, and sites I link to, are new ideas with potential that may not be realized (commercialized) for several years, if ever.

I like Cam's rants because they're pure and moralistic, and because it says something that I like about me. My body chemistry is only mildly tweaked by his Dave-deprecating way of saying things. Fact is I have very little to do with the templates in Radio or Manila. I am a writer and programmer, not an HTML designer. In matters of design I defer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bryanbell.com/&quot;&gt;Bryan Bell&lt;/a&gt;, who in my opinion is one of the heroes of the content management revolution. I get a beautiful looking site that renders slowly in Netscape 4 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/whatIsScriptingNews#usingNetscape4&quot;&gt;disclaimed&lt;/a&gt;) but like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html&quot;&gt;Zeldman&lt;/a&gt;, I believe it's time to move into the future. I get compliments all the time from strangers who see this site and say how beautiful it is. And the design is over a year old. That should give you an idea of how leading edge Bryan is.

The Web now covers these events in real time. Lies like LIVE are easily exposed. They should be aware of this. Was it a news event or entertainment?

I would prefer if Wired appeared to own Lycos, makes more sense to me. And in my mind Dan Gillmor is far more important than every other thing in the Knight-Ridder empire. I wish they'd get a clue and let you gain some momentum with an easy to remember URL, simple weblog-style features, and &lt;i&gt;no linkrot&lt;/i&gt; so the archives keep working.

Tonight it works. Until now Python had us (and everyone else) beat -- they had the simplest way to call remote procedures. Now we match them, and I think our way is better, but they're awfully close.

An easy to install HTTP server that communicates with the mother ship via XML and can search the local area network as effectively as the whole Internet. $40 per year. They'll make a boatload of money. IPO. " created="Sun, 03 Feb 2002 19:20:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

We've also decided to stop hosting MattyG. We sent an email to Matty, but it bounced. We also posted a note on the site's discussion group, and now of course I'm talking about it here on Scripting News. This is the best we can do." created="Sun, 03 Feb 2002 17:10:59 GMT"/>

It's tricky, Blogger &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; like it can create XML output from the contents of the database, but unless we're missing something, it doesn't encode left angle brackets and ampersands, two characters that appear frequently in blog posts.

					<outline text="I could write a text-to-script parser in UserTalk (yes Virginia, contrary to popular belief it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible, it's just an Algol-like language), but instead we're going add an enhancement to the kernel to keep everything where it belongs.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0100012/2002/01/29.html&quot;&gt;Steve Zellers&lt;/a&gt;, who I admire and owe so much to, says we should like C because we use it. And we do like C and we do use it. But that doesn't change something important. While C plays an important role in the under-under-pinnings of the Web, the Web is glued together with scripting. Yes, the interpreters, databases, communication stacks are generally written in C. That's cool. But that's not the Web. (Postscript: Browsers are also written in C, and look &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/16000.html&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; that got us.)" created="Fri, 01 Feb 2002 14:57:38 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Yet it is still mostly a respectful environment. The only way to get this is to practice. Put up a website and do your work there. And get ready to learn. It's not enough to put up a website and leave it there, as many C programmers do. Update it every day. Tell more and more about yourself. And then you'll find yourself scripting more, and leaving some old philosophy behind. " created="Fri, 01 Feb 2002 15:05:28 GMT"/>

It can be a tyranny. It took a bit longer than Atkinson thought it would, but now many users are programming for themselves, and as this happened, it repositions C programmers. We're enablers and optimizers now, not gods, not gatekeepers. DIY is the philosophy of the Web, and because today's machines have so much CPU bandwidth, and scripting has evolved so much, they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; DIY it, instead of waiting." created="Fri, 01 Feb 2002 15:09:02 GMT"/>
