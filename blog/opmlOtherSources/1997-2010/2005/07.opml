On further investigation, one of the log files had grown to 1/2 gigabyte. I shut down the server, archived the file, restarted the server, and it seems to be running much better. Then, looking inside the log file, most of the hits on the static server are checks of Instant Outlines.

Interesting that I find it easier to read and point to a man's account of the conference. This idea came up at a session in Nashville, on international blogging, where Hoder said what they need is for American bloggers to point to them more. I thought about it a bit and said, that I don't think that would help very much, what would really make a difference would be to send me there, to take pictures, to view their world through my lens, and then report that back through my blog. That would help foster understanding, that would be a link that meant something. Pointing to a woman &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; she's a woman isn't a solution to a problem anyone really has. However creating understanding seems to be the solution to everything. " created="Sun, 31 Jul 2005 11:44:42 GMT" type="outline"/>

Well here we are at the height of summer, and the hillsides are like beautifully manicured lawns in heaven. Maybe it's so nice because its cooled off a bit, the highs are only in the low 80s now. And I know that later in this trip, probably tomorrow or the day after, I'm going to re-enter CongestionLand. But south-central NY state is very very nice in the summer.

It's weird because the author is a historian, not a technologist; and it's also weird that they're taking Microsoft to task for what is an industry-wide problem. It's as if they were blaming Iran or Pakistan for the problems of nuclear proliferation. Microsoft was hardly the first or even the biggest abuser of software patents. Again, the Times shows a remarkable lack of timeliness (where were they when the mess was being created, not that they weren't warned), and why make it a Microsoft issue.

In a few years, when everyone gets it, after Apple has reinvented it and the NY Times is gleefully and giddily giving them credit for it, the reason it will have been so successful is that we worked together. Users will have learned how to talk to developers, and developers will have learned how to listen. In that spirit, I offer one of my favorite howto's -- one that explains in three easy steps, &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.opml.org/2005/06/17#bug&quot;&gt;how to report a bug&lt;/a&gt; to a developer. There's more that you can do, but these three things &lt;i&gt;really help&lt;/i&gt; get the problem solved quickly, with a minimum amount of fuss. It's especially important when we're all working together online, where back and forth questions and answers sometimes take hours for each iteration. You want to pack as much information as possible in the first post, but not too much information -- as Joe Friday used to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moviewavs.com/Movies/Dragnet.shtml&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; on Dragnet, &quot;Just the facts ma'am.&quot;" created="Fri, 29 Jul 2005 14:46:29 GMT" type="outline"/>

It works out of the box with NetNewsWire and Radio UserLand, and probably quite a few others (which ones?). I had to adapt the code to get it to work with Bloglines and RSS Bandit. I was able to do this because the formats they used are close enough to Radio's import/export format, and because users supplied me with examples of files. See &quot;how to proceed&quot; on that page for an idea of how the community can work on this. And I'm only willing to bend so far to accomodate creativity, because that's a form of lock-in.

I also wanted to spend some time near my uncle's home, at the places we used to hang out, as a way of saying goodbye. He picked the best part of Florida to live in, the ocean is great, the lifestyle is still pretty southern (although that's changing really quickly).

Let's look at them. First, the Rockies. The idea there would be to do with skiing what I did this winter with the beach. I started skiing when I was very young, around five or six. I didn't like it then, but as I grew up, I grew into it. In my mid-30s I spent a winter skiing, over 40 days, but still based in California. I was in really good shape, so the skiing was wonderful. Now I'm quite a bit older, and not in such great shape, but spending a whole winter skiing would probably get me into some kind of really good shape.

					<outline text="The reason to do it now is that I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do it now. In a few years it might not be possible for me to spend a whole winter skiing.

But there are also plenty of people who aren't skiing at 70. That's the fallacy of old age.

One where tech people meet to try out new ideas, with the support of the investment community, on a pooled basis. The entrepreneur shares ownership in the idea with a group of investors, who then get to bid on starting businesses around the ideas. So you put down micro-bets, $100K to $250K, get a server up and running, and see if the users like it. If they do, fund it up, maybe $2 million, and go to the next level. Why do it in NY?

Suppose you decide the customer is wrong, but the customer is actually right.

It's likely that the freebie didn't really cost you anything, or not very much. Cost of goods ain't what it used to be. Most of the cost is in time, and you'd spend as much time arguing with them, as you would by giving them what they want. And I don't care what you say, an apology and a thanks costs nothing. You can &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be sorry and thankful. Always, no matter what, even if you're being scammed and know it.

A premature conclusion. Apple certainly is tilting the table in their favor, but what if, for the sake of argument, MSN, which has &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; flow than iTunes, were to go the other way? Or Yahoo? Or CNN? The fact that Apple is moving so deliberately in one direction suggests that a competitor may take advantage of that, or realizing that they're leaving a lot of turf uncovered, Apple may, in Month 2 or Month 3, tilt in the other direction. If you study the history of technology, you'll see this is how it often goes. The press tends to see things in terms of corporate size, and very short term effects, but the market moves according to its own logic, at its own pace, if it didn't there never would be new products, like podcasting, for example.

Here it is Mark. Listen up. Podcasting is great because &lt;i&gt;I can do it,&lt;/i&gt; without any expensive hard to use equipment or software, or expensive licenses. I have done webcasts, we had the necessary software and licenses when I worked at Berkman Center. Even so we could only serve a few people at a time. But I can podcast without anyone's permission, and thousands of people can tune in at very low cost. I just record an MP3, link it into a RSS feed, and upload both to a server. Done in minutes, and I didn't need any help. If he would just &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; a podcast in which he says how stupid podcasting is, he would figure out why it's not stupid, while he's doing it. He would be (will be) a fantastic podcaster, when he just tries it. " created="Sun, 17 Jul 2005 08:12:44 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="An experiment. I was interviewed by a professional reporter on Friday while I was at Starbuck's in Harvard Square. It was a 1/2 hour interview.

Okay, I haven't seen the article yet. When it appears, I'll link to it and this comment. Let's see how accurate the story is, and if the time we spent on the phone made a difference. My guess is that it'll be another &lt;i&gt;Adam Curry Invented It&lt;/i&gt; story or maybe this time it will be an &lt;i&gt;Apple Invented It&lt;/i&gt; story.

I have the same idea, but can't bring myself to do it. One of the contributing factors has to be the high price of Windows. I think it would be a good idea to &quot;pave&quot; my laptop to get rid of the spyware. That is, re-install the operating system. Only one problem, my laptop was delivered with the OS pre-installed, and no CDs. So if I want to re-install, I guess I have to buy a copy of Windows. Seems that costs about $350. Almost the cost of a new computer. This just doesn't make sense. I'm a legal licensee of the OS. I think I should be able to get a copy to re-install for the cost of the media.

I'll always err on the side of taking a chance, and always add a grain of salt to everything you read here (and everywhere else for that matter).

Mark just put podcasting in perspective. No one would say that I am negative about podcasting, but I agree with him. The opportunities to make money from podcasting are misunderstood, much in the way people misunderstand money and blogging. You can make a lot of money off both activities, but not the same way as you would from radio programming or news writing. My podcast is an ad for &lt;i&gt;me,&lt;/i&gt; it explains who I am and what I think. That could make me millions of dollars, or make me nothing. I believe in setting expectations for technology realistically, and not over-hyping. We saw in the 90s how it goes when people are unrestrained in hype. Better to try to figure out what's really going on and that's what Cuban is doing, imho." created="Thu, 14 Jul 2005 18:54:34 GMT" type="outline"/>

Not enough people are aware of how it works, I always assumed when the time came people would look and be blown away, but I should have known that people only see what they expect to see. That's cool, I'm the same way. But there's more to the podcasting community than first meets the eye. I learned that last night, at dinner with a friend who's deeply involved in RSS, who wasn't aware that the podcasting community had done something remarkable about organizing itself.

The CEO of Audible was saying the same thing to me, when he complained that I reported on my discontinuation of their service on my weblog. But they don't mind when we say, publicly, when we &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; their products or service, the problems happen when we don't. Bloggers don't want to give on this, and we mustn't. Back in the old days the vendors had full control over users, they could choose what to listen to and what not to listen to, and we had no recourse. Since they paid for the ads, and sponsored conferences and paid the consultants, they fully controlled what was said. Now, as long as the discourse is public and visible, &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; have the power we should have always had. At an intuitive level I've always distrusted back-channel conversations, now I understand why. Some things have to be discussed privately, and that's okay, but when it comes to public products like iTunes and Dell computers, and public standards like RSS and SOAP (just examples) private discourse is inappropriate and should not be supported." created="Sun, 10 Jul 2005 21:40:33 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Another thing about companies. They don't like it when we complain about them in public, but in every dispute over money, they threaten to take their dispute to the credit agencies. It's gotten so that whenever they fuck up, if it's under $200, I just pay the bill. It isn't worth the time it takes to convince them of their mistake, and it sure isn't worth the hassle of getting a black mark taken off my credit record. Blogs are our way of rebalancing the equation. Now when they fuck us, we have a way of giving &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; a black mark.

But they have plenty of time to try to turn OPML into a &quot;legacy&quot; format. (How insulting, how arrogant, how unlikely.) Their priorities are set wrong, they're fighting battles they don't need to fight, and not seeking to improve things for their users and most important, shareholders. If I were an investor in Technorati, I'd ask why Live 8 is so good for me, and how about making the servers work, and why aren't you keeping up with a lot of the changes on the real live web that you're supposed to be tracking?

After they broke up, they kept producing, John Lennon did Imagine and How Do You Sleep at Night, and of course there's lots of great Paul McCartney tunes, even the ones with Linda McCartney aren't all that bad, and George Harrison's career blossomed when he got out on his own. But did you know that there's a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://web2.airmail.net/gshultz/ringorevu.html&quot;&gt;Ringo Starr album&lt;/a&gt;, that's almost as much a Beatles album as Abbey Road or the White Album. Ringo is a great musician, but he had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevesbeatles.com/songs/with_a_little_help_from_my_friends.asp&quot;&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt; for bringing people together, and his 1973 album has some great music.

Talking with Rogers about this yesterday, I realized that it doesn't have to be a huge job, just port the Frontier kernel to Linux and you get the whole thing across with one codebase, and any improvements on Mac or Windows automatically port to Linux. Back in 1998 people were able to get the compiled binary to run under WINE, but now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://kernel.scripting.com/2004/09/28#a20&quot;&gt;Frontier is open source&lt;/a&gt;, that can be done much more reliably.

I spent the better part of an hour talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobiusvc.com/pages.php?pn=team&amp;sub=bfeld&quot;&gt;Brad Feld&lt;/a&gt; at Gnomedex, he's invested in Feedburner, Technorati and Newsgator, and would probably say that his fund is exclusively focused on RSS. Today, to be focused on RSS is the same as saying you're investing in software and data products. RSS is the conduit, it's actually kind of hard to invest in RSS per se (it's a free good), but if you're doing stuff with data these days it's probably got &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; to do with RSS." created="Fri, 01 Jul 2005 12:52:01 GMT" type="outline"/>
