Users got all excited about them too, and set them up imagining how great it was going to be to finally have an orderly life. They happily entered appointments, until they spaced out or got lazy and didn't enter one. All it takes is one for the excitement to turn to guilt.

It's going to make a bunch of people some money, it turns out, due to a quirk in how Google page-rank works. Here's the deal. If a page on my site has 100 pointers, every pointer gives a certain amount of juice to the things it points at. However if the same page has only 3 pointers, then each pointer gives considerably more. Same if I change all but 3 of the 100 pointers to rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; (or so the SEOers assume). Naturally they will change every pointer but the ones that point to their own pages to rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;. Certainly an unintended consequence, if that's actually the way the SEs work.

Inside my mind and emotions go into a swirl, what did I say, am I taking this personally (yes, of course, now that it's been made so personal) etc. There's no possible response other than silence (what are you going to say, no I'm not taking this personally, the asshole has no idea &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; you are taking it, no point arguing it with him). More thought. It's a Republican tactic! Remember how just before the DNC they said the Democrats are so negative, they made that the issue, and as a result the Dems didn't say very much that was negative (except Al Sharpton, bless him, who's not so dumb as to take the bait). Then the Republicans had the most negative convention and campaign in memory, they even dragged out Zell Miller to blast the Dems for having the gall to run against his beloved President. I bet they were howling over that at RNC headquarters. Anyway, the guy who played this little trick is a Democrat, and if he does it again, I'm going to out him. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 24 Jan 2005 16:33:45 GMT" type="outline"/>

It was a good move when they brought him on in 1973 to diversify the editorial face of the paper. Now if the Times could accept a Republican in 1973, it could certainly accept a blogger in 2005. Someone who operates a blog now, and has for some time, and (key point) &lt;i&gt;continues to blog&lt;/i&gt; on his or her own terms while writing regularly for the Times. This would be a big door-opener between the cultures, and would accrue enormously to the benefit of the Times, and probably to the blogosphere (maybe not). But I would support it, assuming they chose a blogger with integrity, inteligence, an idealist who never moves inside the Beltway, whose feet stay firmly planted with the people.

At dinner last night, talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://rconversation.blogs.com/&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/&quot;&gt;Betsy Devine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artofthenew.com/&quot;&gt;Jenny Attiyeh&lt;/a&gt; (lucky Dave, three babes, one guy) about what we can take away from the conference, I said that we had our moments of civility, even affection, across the divide between the pros and the bloggers. But, I posited, the real accomplishment may be that now we better understand who we are, having had a chance to take the same side, even though we're so different. For example, I came to admire John Hinderaker, of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.powerlineblog.com/&quot;&gt;Power Line&lt;/a&gt;, even though our politics are opposite. We have deeper values that bind us. Same with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales&quot;&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the Wikipedia guy. Again, we're opposites in the way we create text but we're both advocates for the same idea, people doing it for themselves. In this context, Ed's story seems slightly profound. A blogger, on arriving safely at home, feels compelled to tell the story. Since I care about his well-being, I'm happy to know that his travels ended safely. But I get a bonus, because his personal story makes the story of the blizzard more real, it's the human interest angle that TV strives for, but really doesn't deliver. Dave Weinberger &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/003601.html&quot;&gt;nails&lt;/a&gt; it. In blogger-land, we don't work at being real because we are real, we never weren't real. That's the bond in common or so it seems to me." created="Sun, 23 Jan 2005 08:54:25 GMT" type="outline"/>

He's teaching a winter course on Evidence at the law school, and wanted to present me to his students at a session devoted to the trial of Socrates. Charlie has a notion that I am the modern embodiment of Socrates, a man who seeks truth by stirring things up. I did it, for the priviledge of hearing what Charlie would say. He gave the benediction at the first BloggerCon, and since then the conference has had a string of successes. So I walked over to Austin Hall from my hotel, in the early morning cold, entered the hall, facing a room full of laptop screens of all sizes. The room was darkened, they were watching a rap video. When it was over Charlie and I talked about weblogs and publishing, podcasting and the conference later in the day. It was very pleasant. At the end, as I was walking out of the room, with another segment of rap starting on the screen, I forgot to say the url of my weblog. &quot;Www.&quot; I said, interrupted by the music.

One mistake I've heard there, and several times on the conference mail list, is an assumption that blogs are all left or right. While, imho, all blogs are political, not all are &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; politics, and certainly not all about &lt;i&gt;US politics.&lt;/i&gt; There are blogs by people from all kinds of places, geographic, intellectual and spiritual. This blog started about scripting (hence its title) and expanded to cover technology, and many other subjects. Yesterday on Zawodny's &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004016.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; I commented that there is no &quot;the&quot; blogging community.

					<outline text="At the time I started blogging, the pros were reporting that there was no new Macintosh software.

					<outline text="I don't think knew they were being dishonest, by then reporting wasn't about facts, it was about conventional wisdom. If CW said there was no new Mac software then the reporters would report that. This meant that competitors didn't actually have to win in the market, that's much harder, they just had to convince the reporters that they had. This leads to not only a very wrong place, but a dangerous one, because the reporters had come to have so much power. With no accountability, no way to vote them out of office, we were totally controlled by them. That's why blogging came about, as a counter-action to the corruption of the professional system.

For a conference about blogging, not too many bloggers. Of course emails come saying they were nice enough to invite you why are you criticizing them. Some of this feedback comes from journalists. This suggests we should really enumerate not just the &lt;i&gt;principles&lt;/i&gt; of credibility, but the practical side of it. I am not friends with the people I cover, and if I should happen to cover people who are friends, it's my responsibility to tell you I'm doing so, and it's also my responsibility to strive to have that not color my judgement (impossible of course). My criticism of people I don't like is validated by equivalent criticism of people I do like. In 2005, as we struggle to find the lines, as the people being covered become the ones doing the covering, it's important to not only have integrity, but to &lt;i&gt;appear to&lt;/i&gt; have it. I may like Dan (almost everyone does) but that doesn't mean he is above criticism. Now, some people among us use intimidation to keep themselves from being criticized. Want to know who they are?

Further, isn't it obvious that Gates is trying to show he's even more enthusiastic about protecting Hollywood's intellectual profits than good-guy untouchable (mostly) Steve Jobs? How come no one gives Jobs a hard time for bending over for Hollywood (and don't forget, Uncle Steve is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixar.com/&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of Hollywood). And finally doesn't Dan have a bit of a conflict because he's paid for his creativity, unlike most musicians? To be really believable, wouldn't Dan have to forgo his salary?

					<outline text="I have mixed feelings about participating in this conference. I would much prefer that they have BloggerCon-style sessions, without presentations, a level playing field, the judgement of the planners not so crucial. It's possible I misunderstand their intent. However, if we're to have a series of presentations, let's get to the heart of the matter, and hear Jones defend his writing. I would be happy to stand up and offer an explanation of my experience with trust and independence of professional reporters, and how that experience formed the genesis of blogging. And I would welcome questions and comments from the pros, and from other bloggers. " created="Sat, 08 Jan 2005 09:15:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="After all this time, after all the disrespect, it's disheartening to have merely earned a place in the audience. It's time for the pros to acknowledge bloggers as equals, and it wouldn't hurt to have the courage to make your accusations to our faces or withdraw them.

					<outline text="Yesterday, walking on the beach, I had a minor epiphany about the press that I thought I should share asap. Talking to a reporter recently, about the difference between bloggers and pros, I tell a story I often tell, the interchange between David Weinberger and Walter Mears at the blogger's breakfast at the Democratic National Convention in July. " created="Mon, 03 Jan 2005 13:20:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Weinberger asked Mears who he planned to vote for in the presidential election. Mears said he couldn't say because that would bring his biases into the discussion, and he writes objectively, his biases are irrelevant. This was about as clear a distinction as I've seen, because bloggers seem to view it exactly the other way. I can't trust you until I know where you're coming from. So a blogger always discloses his opinion on something he's reporting on, so we can &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2002/05/17#lc50fb08cc40cd93e5ade1b2c04ae42be&quot;&gt;triangulate&lt;/a&gt;, get a variety of points of view to determine what's really going on. Triangulation is something bloggers and their readers depend on. In the world of the pro, apparently triangulation is not necessary, because in theory every reporter is objective.

This is where the epiphany begins. That's why the various attempts to self-enforce integrity have been awful failures for the pros. We tested the self-enforcement system put in place by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dave/stories/storyReader$7&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; last spring, we're not exactly nobodies, and got blown off, summarily and rudely. This is not what we would expect from a QA department at any organization, and surely not a newspaper of high repute. We wouldn't tolerate this from government, nor industry, but these days, when a campaign can be deleted, and its supporters disenfranchised, by cable networks because a candidate showed enthusiasm, consider how much progress we can make until we systematically watch the pros and judge the quality of their work. We're fools if we believe they can be trusted to watch over themselves. We have the empirical evidence that proves otherwise." created="Mon, 03 Jan 2005 13:24:51 GMT"/>
