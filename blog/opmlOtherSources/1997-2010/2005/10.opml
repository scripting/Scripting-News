You want to provide them with full feeds, you want to be able to view your feed, and have some idea of what's going on when you look. That's what I get from your message. Weird things like CDATA, while they're valid and definitely not funky (in a technical sense) &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; confusing. I support you in what you want, although other techies will say there's no reason for the technology to be transparent to you, I disagree. People don't use things they don't understand, and it's certainly possible to do it in a way that you can understand, without giving up any of the power and depth that geeks like so much. I'd also be happy to work with Matt to make you happy. I'm pretty sure I know what you want. Keep on truckin. Dave" created="Mon, 31 Oct 2005 01:59:20 GMT" type="outline"/>

I met him for the first time in a meeting in NY, in May, when we got together to talk about the sale of weblogs.com. " created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:35:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Today Mike starts a new blog, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crunchnotes.com/&quot;&gt;CrunchNotes&lt;/a&gt; by telling the story of how TechCrunch got started. He credits me with being an inspiration, and if it's really true, he's taken it so far and done it so well, all the credit belongs to him. Really." created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:37:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What he says is so true. Too many software developers wander into the market without knowing what's been tried before, what worked, what didn't. Often the users know more about the history of the category than the designer of the software. What Mike does, by writing up every product and service that he sees, is the beginning of a process that we must develop; but is itself a revisit of something that used to be done thoroughly and systematically, but because of the quick pace of boom and bust in the tech business, is an art that now needs to be reinvented, a bootup that's actually a reboot." created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:39:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Mike is a lawyer. Laws have precedents. When it was thought that Harriet Miers believed in a constitutional right to privacy, many inferred that she was a choice advocate. One position implies another because legal decisions are based on previous decisions. Sometimes a higher court changes direction and overturns a precedent, this is necessary because the context changes over time. It's true in technology too. In 1985 we designed software to run in 640K; today my machine had more than 500 times that amount of memory, but in order to make it run adequately, I had to double it. Laws that made sense in 1985 clearly need another look in 2005. " created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:41:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In software, I call this system of precedents &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$2070&quot;&gt;design by prior art&lt;/a&gt;. To really make it work, we need to go back and scour the past for lost art. It's not enough to just chronicle what's coming online now (although I'm glad we're doing that). Maybe the next step is for Mike and I to visit Michael Miller, who, as editor-in-chief of InfoWorld and then PC Mag (where he still is, I believe) put in place a system for looking at software over time. That was a system of prior art in software. " created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:43:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's another reason it's a good idea to study the past in software -- anything that was designed or implemented before software patents forms a prior art defense against the patent system of the 21st century. Mike, being both a lawyer and a student of technology, is in a great position to lead us here." created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:47:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In any case, congratulations to my friend Mike, for doing this work so well. It's great when someone so talented and motivated finds something that suits him so well. How lucky for him, but then we're lucky too, because we get the full benefit of his brilliance, without having to do the work! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Fri, 28 Oct 2005 12:53:07 GMT"/>

Even so, there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a price of admission. To get to the BBQ, or the Homebrew Club, BMUG or BloggerCon, you had to have a ride.

Jeff Jarvis pointed to it, and in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/10/21/open-if-you-have-a-key/&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on Jeff's site one of the organizers said it had to be invite-only because they had limited resources. Now, assuming this is sincere, and not spin, I don't think there's so much to be concerned about. Take a step back and ask what the goals of the conference are. How do you know who the right people are? Are you sure you do? Maybe it would be better to let the universe decide who should be at the conference. I can tell you if BloggerCon had been invite-only we would have missed some very interesting and important voices. Even if it's open you can (and must) limit participation to the number of people you have room for -- 200 people, or 100 or whatever. Put up a form on the web, announce the conference, let people sign up. You might be surprised to find that you don't immediately get overwhelmed with signups. All three BloggerCons had space left a few days after the form went live. And you can safely overbook, a good guideline is that 25 percent of the people won't show. " created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 11:53:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My experience with these shows is that if you trust the universe, it will take good care of you. In all three cases, exactly the right number of people showed up. Every seat was filled, a few people had to stand, there were enough lunches, lively discussions, all the goals were achieved. Now we didn't get people who only come when an event is invite-only, but I say that's good! Those people don't come because they love ideas and want to learn and share, they come for other reasons and they change the character of the event, not in a good way, imho.

					<outline text="People who come to open events are true web people -- there's no difference between 1.0 or 2.0 -- it's a constant. You come, like Enoch Choi, to share his story of helping people in a destroyed city (it's a geek story, surprisingly, and a smart one). You come because your three-person startup is achieving success and has big plans for the future, and you want to tell people about how excited you are to be creating something useful, beautiful and empowering. You come because you're young and happy to be alive. Or old and happy to see all the happy young people. " created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:00:51 GMT"/>

					<outline text="This is why I came to Silicon Valley in 1979, when I was 24 years old. In Madison there were people writing software, smart people (some) but I wanted to make software at a different level. I wanted to make stuff that changed everything, that opened closed doors, that gave people power that used to only belong to the rich and old. Like an open conference, I needed to give something up to get there. But there was no gatekeeper at the door to Silicon Valley telling me I needed an invite. The door was open because not only is that a value of the web, but it's also a value of Silicon Valley, even if some people usurp that." created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:17:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Later this week Google will have their invite-only Zeitgeist conference. It's as closed as a conference can be. And this is the company we lifted on our shoulders and held up as a shining example of the web at its best. We were wrong to do that, but forgive us for having hope. At some core level Google did understand the web, but there was also a lot about Google that was against the web, and now that's most of what they are. " created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:07:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is the struggle we are constantly dealing with in the tech business. For a while we send up a beacon, a shining star, and it's exciting! Then they forget their values, where they came from, what made it work for them, and we follow them down into bad years. You'd think we could learn, but apparently we can't. Now can we survive their downfall? That's a good question, and one I don't know the answer to." created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:19:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The excitement today has an element of panic to it. In our gut we can see that the growth is likely to end almost before it gets started. We see Google doing what we knew in our hearts they would do, pick fights with powerful industries that we have nothing against. The publishing industry has done more to support my vision that Google ever has, in fact Google has fought me, at a petty, immature level, based on being incompatible, if you can imagine that, where the publishing industry adopted RSS as-is, without trying to change it or break it. They say the publishers are clueless, I think it's Google's management that desperately needs to find its place in the world. I criticize the NY Times, god knows they deserve it, but when I call Martin Nisenholtz, he takes the call, and we work together, in productive ways. This is the east coast way of doing things. It's something Silicon Valley, which is run by immature men, needs to learn. We don't have to agree on everything to work together. In fact we must work together, and honor our differences with respect. " created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:19:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There is cause for hope. Google isn't the only act in town. Yahoo could challenge their dominance. I hope they do, and I hope they don't do it by being like Google. Embrace the world instead of picking fights with it. Work together because it's the right thing to do and because it's good for business. Point off-site, share the flow, come to BBQs and BloggerCons, know that the bright eyes of happy independent developers are the source of the ideas that drive this place, and make sure there's always a sense that this place is come as you are, no invite required and totally 1.0" created="Sun, 23 Oct 2005 12:24:21 GMT"/>

I tried in so many ways to explain this at the Blogging, Journalism and Credibility conference at Harvard in January of this year, but the Times editorial people, as always, dismiss this criticism with arrogance.

					<outline text="I know that's a provocative title, but I have an idea, a possible solution to a problem that women of our industry raise often and passionately -- how to get more women in leadership positions, not just a few, but a good balance to the men. Sylvia asks this question in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoisylvia.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/10/where_are_the_w.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on her blog yesterday, which started an interesting thread. " created="Thu, 20 Oct 2005 07:48:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's the idea. Let's find industries whose conferences are horribly un-gender-balaced the other way (mostly women, almost no men) and consider merging with them. For example, what's the intersection between Web 2.0 and librarians? (Assuming most librarians are women.)"/>
					<outline text="If we find one that works, that's the begining of a gender-balanced tech industry. Have a conference where we discuss the confluence of technology and librarians (I'm sure there are already such conferences, how many tech industry people go to them?) Are there conferences where they bemoan the lack of men? Interesting question. I can't imagine the men complaining too much about it, actually. " created="Thu, 20 Oct 2005 07:51:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In any case, I suspect most men in the tech industry would be happy to have more women. Believe it or not, many of us &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; women. There's nothing more dull than a conference with 100 men and 2 women. You need a good mix to keep things interesting. "/>
					<outline text="The Greensboro blogging &lt;a href=&quot;http://2005.convergesouth.com/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month was more interesting because there were far more black people there than I've ever seen at a tech industry conference. How did this happen? They chose North Carolina A&amp;T, a state college that's largely black, to host the event. The professors and students were all black, as were many participants of the community. There's a big lesson in that. If you want change, like Dorothy, you have to leave Kansas, you can't expect change to come to you, you have to go &lt;i&gt;there.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Thu, 20 Oct 2005 08:03:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, there's a pretty constant flamer in the comments in Sylvia's post, someone who acts like she knows me (she hasn't got a clue), and says some pretty bad things. I'm pointing anyway, lest you think (as my pal &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/2005/10/18#bigbigmoronsAndIdiotsbigbig&quot;&gt;Amyloo&lt;/a&gt; does) that women behave better than men on the net. My experience is that women can be pretty nasty to men on the net. Maybe we should try to counteract some of that too. As I said some men genuinely like women, and if you're a pro-woman woman, it seems you should support that. Of course I'll probably be attacked for saying that too, but what the heck.

However, I personally have experienced the bitter bile of the Wikipedia community for daring to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/11#peopleWithErasers&quot;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the quality of the &quot;encyclopedia&quot; may vary from article to article and day to day. Some stories turn into virtual battlegrounds. It's not really Wikipedia's fault, it's the way online communities evolve where everyone has an equal voice. No matter how good something is, there are always more idiots and morons to take it down. Maybe that's another law. On the Internet the volume of messages posted by idiots plus those posted by morons always exceeds the number posted by well-meaning moderately intelligent people, squared.

A few weeks ago, I asked a couple of other people to join us, and maybe soon I'll ask more. Not sure how to do this, but it's becoming interesting. Sort of an old farts genius network or something like that. OFGN. Whatever. Anyway, I invited a young fart, Mike Arrington, to join us yesterday, and of course an interesting two-hour discussion &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcast.msnbc.com/audio/podcast/pd_mtp-10-16-2005-073738.mp3&quot;&gt;ensued&lt;/a&gt;. Mike is brilliant and hot, and as I said young, but not so young that he couldn't run for President. Anyway, Steve said something that puzzled Mike. Something about links. Mike said he cares more about being linked to than being named. And then Steve said he should care more about being named. I agreed with Steve. I may have a better perspective on this, having spent much of the last year watching the quality of weblogs.com go down as spam-blogs (mostly from Blogspot, as Chris notes below) filled the pipe with their nonsense, and of course we pass the junk right on down the food chain to Technorati and PubSub. Good news about that, I had lunch with Niall Kennedy at Technorati on Thursday, in SF, and we're going to do some work to help get better data to flow into Technorati. I know how to bootstrap cooperation, even if people don't necessarily like me, I know how to get them to help each other. I'll explain later. In any case, here's something to memorize. &lt;i&gt;Links are now devalued.&lt;/i&gt; Page-rank is under attack and the attackers are winning. It won't be long before Google itself is infested. Tim Bray is right, below, it's time for Google to get on top of this. They're both the victimizer and the victim. The spammers found a huge hole in Page-rank. You could drive a truck through it. I was the early warning system on this, the canary in the coal mine. They don't like to listen to me, maybe they'll accept Verisign's help. " created="Sun, 16 Oct 2005 17:16:16 GMT" type="outline"/>

This show is worth grabbing if only because when asked if I ever expected RSS to achieve all it has, I said Yes I did. Oooops. In the NerdTV interview I said No I didn't.

We talked about formats, protocols, how to work with the community at a content and technical level, and linking into the community directory. At this point, I'm not sure how much of this Yahoo did, we'll be diving in over the next few days for sure. But they were the first podcasting network site to do this, Odeo didn't do it, nor did Apple or Podshow. No matter what Yahoo did, at least they talked, listened and trusted, and that's a start.

A few observations. Greensboro has a FW Woolworth &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smithsonianlegacies.si.edu/objectdescription.cfm?ID=42&quot;&gt;lunch counter&lt;/a&gt; where they say the civil rights movement was born. Their drivers don't honor pedestrian right-of-way. Bush nominated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100300305.html&quot;&gt;Miers&lt;/a&gt; for the Supreme Court for a few reasons that actually make sense. First, if he had nominated a candidate that the conservatives would have fought for, he would have put Republican senators in a real bind, if they come from states where the majority of voters are pro-choice. The problem for the conservatives is that that's 80 percent of the electorate, and probably almost all the states except Wyoming and Alaska. It would have been suicide for him or for the senators, and it was his choice, because there was no way a pro-choice or pro-life nominee was going to make it through the process. So he chose suicide for no one. Seems reasonable. The second reason he did it (and there's no doubt that Miers is pro-choice, that's why the conservatives are so pissed) is that he's pro-choice too, but can't say it for fear of destroying the illusion that the Republicans are actually so radical.

				<outline text="An indication of how podcasting has changed conference-going for me. I had a choice between three sessions yesterday morning, and decided to go to a discussion led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales&quot;&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; about Wikipedia. As he started, it became clear that he wasn't actually going to lead a discussion, he was giving a talk, with slides. He said he would be informal and let us ask questions during the talk instead of at the end. I listened for five minutes, and all the while it seemed as if I was listening to a podcast. If my only job is to listen, I don't need to actually be there. Instead I went to a session led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackfeminism.org/&quot;&gt;Tiffany Brown&lt;/a&gt; about blogging from the outside. It was a raucous, interesting, multi-racial and multi-gender discussion about the usual thing, how we can all get heard more. There were even a few people nearing retirement age.

				<outline text="I tried the Google news reader again, this morning, after it had loaded all my feeds (it seems to take quite a few hours to do that).This is the second blog-related product they've come out with recently that appears not to have been touched by human beings before it was introduced to the world (the other was the ridiculous blog search). I think they need to start using their own stuff before releasing it. And maybe look at the competition for ideas. When you're first into a market there's an excuse for being so wrong. But the first of this kind of software shipped six years ago. To give you a comparison, Visicalc shipped in 1979. By 1985 we had been through two generations of spreadsheets with Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel. Google's reader is a huge step &lt;i&gt;backward&lt;/i&gt; from what was available in 1999.

First, start a blog, and talk about your favorite baseball team, what it was like taking your kids to the playground today, where you like to ski, who you voted for in every presidential election. Take a bit of time to catch up on the other blogs, get a sense of where your complany fits in among the other creative people on the web. Then stop shipping stuff for a while, and tell everyone you're not scared of Microsoft, and they have nothing to fear from you. At work, have two meetings every week with the people who work on the search engine you reach from the home page at google.com. Tell them what you like and don't like about the product, every week, and tell them how you like the improvements they've made. And then in the second meeting, invite a user to meet with you and the team, and ask them to do the same. Be creative in the kinds of users you include in the process. Steadily improve the search engine in response to their wants. This prescription will help shore you up against the true danger to Google, it's own arrogance and sense of self-reliance. You aren't an island unto yourself, the fountain of all wisdom, and your ship is floundering, but I'd guess you can't see it. That's the first thing to fix Eric, you have to see it as we do.

If you notice how many times I quote the Cluetrain, and have adopted Markets Are Conversations as my mantra, you'll see that the respect is two-way. Reminds me that an angry person in the audience at today's conference was giving Jay Rosen some shit, no one could figure out what he was saying, but he kept pointing at me saying I would support what he said. I asked for the floor, and volunteered that I agreed with everything Jay said, and it was true. We couldn't stump him once, he's the prophet of the blogs, bring the truth to the inkstainers, not that they want to hear the truth. I guess he's got a bit of Harry Truman in him too. Point is, there aren't many people whose philosophies match mine perfectly. Jay is one. Scott Rosenberg is another, as is Doc Searls. I guess that's some kind of security that there is a method underneath the madness, some logic that at least three people get.

But the Bay Bridge at rush hour is intense, but smartly designed, and while the travel wasn't quite as easy as it would have been arriving from the south, it wasn't bad. They had TMobile at the gate, so I was able to check in, briefly before getting on the plane." created="Thu, 06 Oct 2005 23:16:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I had plenty of room on the plane, a good book, movie and some crosswords, when the flight arrived at the Cincinnati airport (actually in Kentucky), I had thirty minutes to get from Terminal C to Terminal A to catch the connecting flight to Greensboro. I checked my voicemail as the plane from SF taxied, and I couldn't make out the message, just bits of it. I thought it was Jason Calacanis, giving me a heads up that they were getting ready to announce their deal with Weblogs, Inc being acquired by AOL. When I got into the terminal as I rushed to Terminal A, I listened to the message. It was from Mark McLaughlin at Verisign, saying that they were getting ready to announce the deal they had with Scripting News, Inc, because it was already on some of the blogs. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. " created="Thu, 06 Oct 2005 23:19:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I didn't have a way to write down Mark's phone number, so I called Mike Arrington, who was one of two attorneys working with me on the deal (Mike is also the editor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, and brokered the deal with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teare.com/&quot;&gt;Keith Teare&lt;/a&gt;, his partner in Edgio, a company you'll be hearing great things about shortly, I'm sure). Mike didn't answer, so I tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://infrablog.verisignlabs.com/2005/10/weblogs_20_1.html&quot;&gt;Mike Graves&lt;/a&gt;, one of the guys I worked with at Verisign, no luck there iether. Both are at the Web 2.0 conference in SF. As I was approching the gate for my outbound flight, Staci Kramer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2005_10_06.shtml#051717&quot;&gt;PaidContent&lt;/a&gt; called, asking if I could confirm that there was a deal. I asked her what she had, and she said she had read something on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kottke.org/05/10/weblogscom-sold-to-verisign&quot;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt;, but so far just had rumors. I said I couldn't confirm, she asked if I'd call her back if I could, and I said I would. I've worked with Staci on a few stories in the past, and I will indeed call her back, she'll be the first reporter I talk to about this deal. " created="Thu, 06 Oct 2005 23:22:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I finally got on the nearly empty plane to Greensboro, I listened to the voicemail again, got Mark McG's number, called him, got filled in, asked him to hold off announcing anything until I had a chance to see what had been reported, then I hung up, tried Arrington again, still no answer, then I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/10/06.html#a11383&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt;, and he read me Kottke's piece. Not bad! He got the number wrong, but otherwise more or less understood why I wanted to do the deal, and raised a very valid question about BigCo's and Verisign, and so forth. No doubt we'll have an interesting discussion about this in the blogosphere, and I hope a productive one, and that we'll all find a way to work with Verisign. I think there's reason to believe they can and will do a much better job of running the ping center than I have been able to, and this is the perfect example of individual innovators (myself in this case) working with large companies in ways that leverage the strength of both. " created="Thu, 06 Oct 2005 23:26:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The bootstrap of weblogs.com is something a bigco should not attempt, it's hard to make it go, and most bootstraps don't, and it requires trust, something an individual is more likely able to inspire than a big company. On the other hand, running a serivce that other bigco's depend on (like Google, and Microsoft, to name two) is not something a person like myself should attempt. I think Verisign is the perfect company to do it. Their name servers, I hear, respond to 250,000 requests per second at peak loads. In comparison, weblogs.com's 1-2 million pings a day seems a drop in the bucket. Further, it will require great resources to tackle the ping-spam issue, and there Verisign's expertise, not just what's visible today, but what's coming down the road, will make all the difference. I was in no posiiton to do this on my own. And belive me, the Technorait's and PubSub's, even Feedster and Bloglines, weren't helping out very much. I belive they'll respect Verisign much more than they respected me. And this deal will free me up to work on new ideas around blogging, RSS, OPML, web services, podcasting, etc. I'm good at digging holes, I have to pass off to others to make the trains run on time when the service grows as big as weblogs.com has.

					<outline text="Anyway, the plane has just entered North Carolina in preparation for landing in Greensboro. Writing this essay has been an excellent way to pass the time. When I get off the plane I'm going to look for a phone, call my friends at Verisign, and encourage them to go ahead and make the announcement. When they have made the announcement, I will upload this document to Scripting News, and we can continue the dialog from the ground in Greensboro." created="Thu, 06 Oct 2005 23:36:36 GMT"/>

Haven't had a chance to carefully read the piece, but did skim it. It's nice that finally O'Reilly allows me my role in creating RSS. Good to put that piece of acrimony behind us. However most of the ideas in his piece could be found in the back-issues of DaveNet, starting in late 1994. The Web he descirbes was evolved during the dot-com boom. XML-RPC started in 1998, and RSS in 1997, OPML in 2000. The people that go to his conference weren't thinking about the web as a platform for the people, but as it turns out, that's what it was (and is). The O'Reilly piece appears good, the only thing left is for them to drop the exclusivity of his conference, that's what makes his Web 2.0 totally not about the web.

I checked to see how many sites were linking to me in the new scheme, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://technorati.com/search/scripting.com&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that there were 4778, which seems would place Scripting at #19, if I have any clue how their rankings work. I must be missing something. In any case you could get rid of the lsits altogether and I wouldn't mind, I don't compete with the top sites on that list.
