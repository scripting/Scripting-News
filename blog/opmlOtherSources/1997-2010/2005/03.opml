					<outline text="However, if there's any rationality to the justice system in the US, the EFF will prevail in the Grokster case. Why? Because, the act of freely distributing other people's work, without compensation, is something the user is doing, not the software developer.

Copyright is not sacred, and there are times when it must be relaxed, and it must be possible to disclaim copyright, something the Creative Commons helps with, but if we can't rely on the electronic media to render our thoughts and expressions without altering their meaning in transit, what's the &lt;i&gt;point&lt;/i&gt; of having electronic media? As I've said here before, the written word is now largely electronic, as is commerce, health care, aviation, and who can disagree that accuracy and attribution matter in those endeavors?" created="Tue, 29 Mar 2005 08:37:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The problem with the EFF psosition is that in order to remain consistent, they have had to say that copyright doesn't exist -- if a policy or law restricts what a user can do on the Internet then that is a bad policy or law. The courts can't agree with the EFF. I don't agree with the EFF." created="Tue, 29 Mar 2005 08:41:44 GMT"/>

How different is this from Apple interfering with the work of authors of their fan sites, a cause which the EFF has championed.

					<outline text="Okay, let me explain &lt;i&gt;why I don't.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Sun, 20 Mar 2005 12:17:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, I don't have a podcasting product, so when you think of me as a competitor of Evan's that's not correct. I'm working on other stuff, not podcasting tools. I may even be a user of Odeo's product, but right now I'm not inclined to, because they are going over my head to sell me, or that's what they think they're doing. All I've heard about Odeo has been second or third-hand, demos at exclusive insider conferences. Frankly, I'd rather use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/index.php&quot;&gt;open source tools&lt;/a&gt;, even if they're not quite as good as Evan's, because I get them without the arrogance and bluster. And hey, they actually exist. I have no direct evidence that Evan's software is anything but vaporware. "/>
					<outline text="I used to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera&quot;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; to those insider conferences myself, and I realized that they weren't doing anything other than talking about themselves, while, quite independently, the market was booming. They confused their talk with the boom in the market, created an image of cause-and-effect where there was none. Then when the boom went away it all looked silly. Then it happened again, and more conferences with people dropping hints that they really got the boom, so the boom had something to do with themselves, and they could make you rich if you bought their stock. Then the boom collapsed, but the self-proclamations continued, and again started to &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/03/20/tim_speaking.jpg&quot;&gt;look silly&lt;/a&gt;."/>
					<outline text="Nowadays it's gotten to the height of ridiculousness. There isn't even a boom, just a bunch of insiders who think it's cool they're inside. No one has made one cent off podcasting and already the NY Times says there's a business model and tries to give the market to their friends (who haven't shipped anything), and people at TED are ooohing and ahhing, and wondering how they can get in on the IPO. These are the exact same people that got so many to think they were the brains behind the last booms. No wonder they want to do it again. It's really profitable, for some."/>
					<outline text="This time there's a chance for everyone to see how silly it is because centralized radio is being routed around and the playing field has been leveled in word publishing. So the new business models propose to install a new group of centralizers. Hmmm. Why won't that work? Well, because the economics shifted, and we don't need them anymore. Doc and the rest of the Gillmor Gang came really close to getting this and saying it out loud in the last episode. But when you get into the reality distortion field of one of these insider conferences, well, if you take the drugs you start to believe that the old guys are kaput, and you're one of the new guys! Start shopping for the big house and the fast car. But later, when the drugs wear off, you see that the new media isn't going to be owned by anyone, not you, and not your insider friends." created="Sun, 20 Mar 2005 11:36:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anway, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say that all the vendors have to prove themselves in the market, and doing that means understanding the users, and to really understand the users, you have to be one of them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/discuss/msgReader$5521?mode=day&quot;&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt;, you don't have to do a podcast, and neither do I, but the people who make products for podcasters do, if they don't will have failed products.

					<outline text="Last week there were two conferences that I didn't go to but followed through the Web. I could have gone to either of them in person, if I had been willing to pay their fees, and been willing to be in the audience or the hallways, at all times. In other words, I would have to accept my place as a second-level person, an outsider, in the presence of insiders. " created="Sat, 19 Mar 2005 12:27:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There are two conflicting emotions around this. First, why aren't I an insider? I feel like I've earned the respect of the people who put on the conferences, and the people who participate. And the second emotion, harder to find with the first one swirling, is wait a minute, why should I accept the premise that there are two levels? When I put on a conference, or throw a party, I work really hard to erase the idea that there are two levels, to make everyone feel welcome and equal. Really. It's hard work, because people are always trying to nominate themselves for insider-ness, and push other people to the outside. I remember well what it was like going to Esther's conferences in the 80s, when the insiders all had someone to eat with, and I was paying thousands of dollars for the priviledge of eating by myself because I didn't know anyone.

Talking to us through you ain't going to cut it. Your friends who want to earn the respect of the podcasters should explain in the medium, in their own voices, in their own words -- produce a podcast and tell us what the fuck they're doing, instead of leaving us guessing.

Basically you tell it about different search engines by showing it how to query something in each, and get back an RSS return. Then when you search for some term, say foo+bar, it performs the search in all the engines you have configured it for. So it's a way to group a bunch of search engines together and command them all to look for the same thing. It is clever. It is something that hasn't been done before, to my knowledge. That's the good news. The bad news is that Amazon is a leading patent abuser. So as good as this idea is, it's bad for all the rest of us, unless they tell us that they're granting us some kind of license to use the idea.

For what it's worth, that's been my experience as well. They are pushing one agenda on the browser developers, but it's not the agenda of all developers. Me, I want to see a really great text editor inside the browser, I've wanted it for close to a decade now. I think the Web is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetwowayweb.com/about&quot;&gt;two-way medium&lt;/a&gt; and a browser that can't &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; pages as easily as it browses them is just half a browser. The WaSP guys aren't interested, because as designers, their livelihood depends on it being hard for users to create content. Kind of like a book publisher working to keep a format complicated so there will be demand for their book. Yeah, I've actually seen this happen. Talk about the tail wagging the dog.

People from the platform vendor (today that's Microsoft, Yahoo and Google) are up on stage, explaining how they are solving problems independent developers solved years ago. The independent developers are in the audience, grousing about how they're reinventing stuff that already works, blowing them out of the water, and crushing their hopes for the future. Some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2005/03/steve_gillmor_s.html&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; are even the same! Heh.

Two things need to be changed in the application, it needs a new name (more on that in a bit) and it needs an icon. Since the native format of the application is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, the icon should be derived from the logo for the format. The icon has to work on both Windows and Macintosh. It should certainly be red. It's possible it could be just the OPML logo itself. And now for the name. As you might imagine I've named a few outliners in my day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/thinkTank2Pc&quot;&gt;The first&lt;/a&gt; had the best name. Now this is non-commercial software built on an open source base. So the name, it seems, should be simple and say what the program does. So I decided to name it after the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; it edits. And this should change the way people view the format, because it's the rarest of XML formats, one that has an editor that reads and writes it, natively. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the name of the new outliner is... &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/03/14/productname.jpg&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;.

And the plane dipped its wings! I laughed out loud. Maybe it's just the point-touching thing. Inside each of us we're a point, that's where our soul lives, and when you wave-and-smile you touch the other person's point, and when they wave-and-smile back &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; point is touched, and that feels good, and, at its most basic level, is what being human is all about. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sat, 12 Mar 2005 18:02:12 GMT" type="outline"/>

The big mistake you're making is the same one Google is, rolling over the core advocates with your corporate machine. You forgot how hard it was to build loyalty in the first place. In Google's case, there were good search engines when you came along. The thing that made Google different is that you treated us decently while the earlier search engines forgot who we were, and were treating us like eyeballs, not people. Apple lost their connect to their most loyal users when they killed the clones, that was the low point, and since then have steadily reconnected, although it's doubtful if they even understand this. Again, it's only because Microsoft was so utterly unable to understand computer users that Apple was able to get back on its feet. Now both Apple and Google are inviting a new generation to perhaps treat the users with some respect, or at least not quite so much disresepct as the current leaders are. Round and round we go, big wheel keep on turnin. Lalala. (PS if you work at Microsoft and think this is your chance, forget it. Your company is &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; scared of users.)" created="Fri, 11 Mar 2005 21:45:01 GMT" type="outline"/>

I'm glad to hear, based on his column, that Google is considering a redesign for AutoLink. For what it's worth, if they changed to use only a drop down menu listing all the places they can take the user from the page, instead of marking up the page itself, I would turn from a critic to a supporter. I want the features, I like it when computers do things for me, but its design was too costly for authors and publishers. In a drop-down there would be no confusion about where the new links came from, and which were the new links, they would emanate from a space clearly marked as being Google's, instead of appearing to come from the author of the page." created="Thu, 10 Mar 2005 13:36:01 GMT"/>

It's great to get all this music. Not clear what terms it's being offered under, though. Can it be used in podcasts? That's pretty important. 2.
