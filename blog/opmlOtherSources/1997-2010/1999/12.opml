He taught us to understand our &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/05/12/DoGalaxiesDream#doGalaxiesDream&quot;&gt;context&lt;/a&gt;, not just focus on the little picture." type="outline"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://queso.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Jason Levine&lt;/a&gt; asks good questions. Yes, we'll find a way to get you a .root file for your site if and when you opt out. You are running in the big UserLand glossary, and your own. You can over-ride any of our definitions thru the Shortcuts page. Your syndication XML is &lt;a href=&quot;http://queso.editthispage.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, it's in Scripting News format, ready for registration with &quot;My.UserLand&quot;. About the list of members, got it. It's one of the top feature requests. Why haven't we implemented it yet? (Anticipating the next question.) Unfortunately there are only so many hours in a day. We'll get to it for sure, soon." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Another question Jason asks, what about my peers? Where are the other sites on EditThisPage.Com? We do have a page listing all the member sites. It's not optimized yet, so I hesitate to make it public. (And it's got some bugs too, who wants to deal with bug reports on a half-finished feature?) So with those caveats, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/members&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who complains or reloads too often will enter the Idiot's Hall of Fame for December 1999.
