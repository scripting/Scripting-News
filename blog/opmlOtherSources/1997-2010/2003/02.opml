Also two reports on News.Com, one about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rss.com.com/2100-1024-990442.html?type=pt&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news&quot;&gt;new ad program&lt;/a&gt; on Google, and another on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-1024-986204.html&quot;&gt;new patent&lt;/a&gt; that has been issued to them, apparently their first one. Then I read the excellent Google Village &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.googlevillage.info/2003/02/28.html&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; (that site is so good). " created="Fri, 28 Feb 2003 10:00:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Put it all together, and Google has changed. Kottke is right, it is no longer a search engine. He gets one thing wrong, there is nothing more they can do to improve the search engine with Blogger content, unless they ignore changes.xml from weblogs.com, but I bet that's exactly what they're doing. I suppose it's not immoral, but get this -- it's not web-like." created="Fri, 28 Feb 2003 10:35:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Google started as a response to bloat and non-weblike-behavior among the search engines. At least that's what we &lt;i&gt;hoped&lt;/i&gt; they were. They never actually said. This is what their success is built on, we perceive their love of the Web. Now it becomes clearer, thanks to Martin's comments, that they just want to put ads on our stuff. Why didn't I see that before. " created="Fri, 28 Feb 2003 10:00:37 GMT"/>

I responded by asking Joi if he wanted ads on his weblog. He said no. I thought that was interesting because I don't want them either. I don't know why I don't want them, perhaps if I could make some real money doing it, but I don't think anyone is going to offer me that. And if they did, I would wonder what they want in return. Really, no kidding." created="Fri, 28 Feb 2003 10:23:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And in a way I didn't like to be asked the question about UserLand, because I'm going the other way. Google came out of academia, so did I, a generation before. Now I'm going back. What has become of the commercial world is a mockery of my dreams for it. It's going around in loops. Now what the world needs to replace Google is a Google like the one that we fell in love with, one that's working for the greater good, that points off site for no reason other than it's the right place to point to. Now with their patents, and their captured content, Google is no longer that. It's a loop because five years ago you could have said exactly the same about Alta Vista or Infoseek, after &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; became more than a just search engine." created="Fri, 28 Feb 2003 10:06:02 GMT"/>

There just weren't that many feeds that would appeal to someone with an English degree. Now that's different. We have the NY Times, BBC, the Harvard weblogs, and more on the way all the time. So I spent some time yesterday creating a prototype for something that I'd like to add to Manila, as a gift, no need to pay me -- an aggregator at the community level. Here's how it works." created="Wed, 26 Feb 2003 14:10:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Each Manila site has one or more managing editors, contributing editors, content editors and members. The ME's can decide how public the site is, it could be totally private, members only, or some sections can be private. In this model, the MEs decide what feeds the community subscribes to. Then, using the same aggregator that's built into Radio, every hour, Manila reads the subscribed-to feeds, and they come together on the aggregator page on the Manila site. Each site on a server can subscribe to any number of feeds. If two sites subscribe to the same feed, it's actually only read once each hour. This optimization was surprisingly easy given Manila's internal architecture." created="Wed, 26 Feb 2003 14:12:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, a rough prototype of this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/aggregator&quot;&gt;up and running at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. You're welcome to try it out, even bookmark it. I still have a lot of work to do here. I want to have a page that shows you which feeds it's reading. The Prefs panel hasn't even started yet. Lots of work to do, but it is usable. Now if you've been curious about what it's like to run an aggregator of your own, check out this one which we're running for you." created="Wed, 26 Feb 2003 14:14:59 GMT"/>

People sometimes ask what the high-water mark is. Look at the page. See the numbers down the left side. The highest that number has ever been, since the inception of weblogs.com, is 1731. There was a point when I thought 100 was a lot. Now it's creeping up on 2000. By the time it gets to 10,000 it will be unusable and we'll need to have a new approach to change notification. By then I think the idea of a desktop web server, like the one in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio&lt;/a&gt;, will be common place, and we'll have a proxy server in there, and the software will be able to show you updates for weblogs that you have clicked on a lot in the past. Basically the software will be able to learn as you go. In order to get that you will need something like Radio on your desktop, or pay someone to run a server for you, or wait until &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/m/Moore_s_Law.html&quot;&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt; makes 200 gigahertz CPUs for under $1000. After cleaning out my garage this weekend, I have no doubt we're going there. In the 80s I would have been surprised at how big and fast today's machines are, and I was an optimist back then.

					<outline text="My comment. Steve, anyone who knows anything about Silicon Valley knew that Google would be no different. &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/02/01/johnDoerrOnABicycle&quot;&gt;John Doerr&lt;/a&gt;, a man who I consider a friend, is in the business of IPOs. He doesn't back companies for the good of the Internet, although I'm sure he doesn't mind if they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; good for the Internet. But that's not why he invests. You never heard of Google before he gave them $25 million to buy all those great servers. They are going public, for sure, with the hottest IPO since Netscape (another Doerr deal), as soon as the market is receptive. I've tried to be straight about this, for a long time, but people didn't want to hear it. Part of the weblog phenomenon is opening up the back rooms so they're visible to the public. I've been an insider in the Valley since I arrived in Sept 1979. I had no illusions about Google. They were and are a wonderful search engine. Larry and Sergey are great technologists and entrepreneurs. And then as they grow, they hire out of the general talent pool of Silicon Valley, and become just like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://151.200.14.38:8080/visicalc_story/Visicalc_Intro_6_79/page_01.htm&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,20803,00.html&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://hci.stanford.edu/hcils/examples/penpoint.html&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fadell.com/fadellvs2/At_Work/Articles/Mercury/Mercury_Text/mercury_text.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/19961219074448/http://www7.netscape.com/&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com/&quot;&gt;you've&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sun.com/&quot;&gt;heard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macromedia.com/&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; come and gone.

After talking with Noah, I understand why. Blogger is centralized, making configuration easy. Radio is not centralized, and further the user might be behind a firewall or NAT and unable to receive an XML-RPC call, which is how Noah's software works. One solution, and it's not a very pretty one, is to do a mail-to-weblog, or use instant messaging (AIM or Jabber), but then the user might not have the features enabled, or want them enabled. I suggested that we work this out with Brent Simmons, who has had to traverse many of these issues in his work on NetNewsWire.

It was so much fun to see people looking for the Sumner Tunnel which they took from the airport since you have to take the Callahan to get back. Ever since they changed the rules to give priority to cars leaving the traffic circle we've lost the edge. And requiring all cars to stop at stop signs -- what a waste. It wasn't that way when I took my driving test (really -- 2nd and 3rd cars didn't have to stop)."/>

				<outline text="5:30PM Pacific -- Back in California. Hey it's good to be back. But driving back from the airport I got itchy to get on the road and do my cross-America drive. Having DirecTV is nice, but JetBlue is cheap -- you only get the crummy stations, all but one has commercials (the exception was playing a Phil Collins concert, not exactly my kind of music, but not bad). I would have killed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://turnerclassicmovies.com/&quot;&gt;Turner Classic Movies&lt;/a&gt;. The crew is about as friendly as any other airline. Not sure why people rave about them so much. On TV, they had lots of meaningless nonsense about the upcoming war in Iraq. Good interview with Condoleezza Rice. She wants to ask the demonstrators what they want to do about Saddam. I gave this some thought. She'll never get a meaningful answer. The problem is, in the West we raise people on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/&quot;&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/&quot;&gt;intellectual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drphil.com/&quot;&gt;garbage&lt;/a&gt;, so when we need them to think, you just get garbage &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gigo&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;. I heard General Wesley Clark on Meet The Press. Very good. He's running for President, no doubt about that. He's not even very good at the denials. BTW, one more peeve about JetBlue. There's no way to turn off the TV. Heh. (Postscript: You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; turn off the TV, turn the brightness to zero.) Having a TV on in your face is quite a distraction. On the other hand, they could submerge a keyboard in the tray table, and voila, you got a nice laptop built into the seat. I'd like that for sure." created="Mon, 17 Feb 2003 01:24:23 GMT"/>

People were chirping about Tripod validating weblogs (actually mostly Tripod) and I thought that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hooey&quot;&gt;hooey&lt;/a&gt;. Now, on the other hand, Google offering weblogs, now that is some shit. I hope Pyra made a lot of money -- even better -- got some Google stock. I bet their bandwidth problems are solved now. I hope they keep their independence. I tried to imagine what Google was thinking, but we'll have to just wait until they tell us, if they do. It's probably a good thing for blogging, and probably also a good thing for Blogger's competitors because it's likely to suck in other Google-like companies. It's great that Google decided to buy rather than make. I wouldn't be surprised if the other popular blogging tools had similar deals cooking. Not much more to say at this time.

After we'll go out and get some food somewhere (cheap) in the Havard Square area. It's a good chance to meet other people in the weblog world in the Boston area.

Your premium rate may only be altered up or down a limited amount based on your age and geographic location.

To Doc and Chris, both of whom wear both hats, professional and amateur, consider that many news reports are quotes and connective text, nothing more. The blogging world is just the quotes. You get to find your own authorities and instead of getting soundbites, you can hear all they have to say. Some reporters say it's revolutionary to publish the full text of their interviews on the Web but I say that's second best. When the reporter takes notes he or she is selective, they can't write down everything, and they introduce errors, incorrectly writing down what was said. Better to give the keyboard to the authority and let them say it in their own words. That's the premise of weblogs." created="Fri, 07 Feb 2003 16:22:59 GMT"/>

I wonder if they had a source, or if they just made it up. These big self-confident (some might say arrogant) newspapers make mistakes in every article. Usually we just gloss it over. But it's over the line in articles that proclaim how superior they are at drilling down to the truth. Enough of that. Let's see how quickly they correct the mistake I just called them on.

This is a perfect example of a BigPub letting a small group of BigCo's define a new technology, or so they think. In fact, new technologies are already shaped when we discover them, making it a puzzle. The Big Guys were guessing wrong almost from the start. They need new windshield wipers on their glasses. Web Services are technology for gluing desktop applications to each other and to centralized servers over the Internet. It's the next layer on the Web, a little higher level than XML and HTTP (on which it builds). To see the furthest development of Web Services look no further than the weblog world, where new tools are being created in just this model, actually for quite a few years. I'm using one right now to write this. Even better, it's something a reporter can understand, because it's about what they do, research, writing and publishing. But a guy like Steve Lohr doesn't trust himself enough to break out of the grip of the BigCo's. He lets their PR people frame the article. So all the articles are cast the same way, and they're all wrong. " created="Mon, 03 Feb 2003 13:33:23 GMT"/>
