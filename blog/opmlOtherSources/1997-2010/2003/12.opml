This usually doesn't get you anything but this time it got me an empty &lt;a href=&quot;http://69.10.144.111/&quot;&gt;Movable Type weblog&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;Shanti Braford.&quot; I looked up this person &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Shanti+Braford&amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;on Google&lt;/a&gt;, and found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://sablog.com/&quot;&gt;he&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kiruba.com/shanti.html&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popdex.com/&quot;&gt;Popdex&lt;/a&gt;.

They were smart not to rely on our minds, because there was no evidence that we wanted to use our minds.&quot; That was totally consistent what I saw with Dean last night. There were 150 people in the room, mostly it was about lies, bedtime stories, telling people what they want to hear. No minds activated. Some good lines, a glimmer that minds may have played a role in the Dean campaign at one time, but not today. Now they're trying to get elected, and I believe in doing so are guaranteeing that they won't. If you're looking for an airbrushed guy, Clark is much stronger. I don't know why people care how much money Dean has raised, that's just going to buy commercials. I'd love to see one of the pols use their money to solve some problems &lt;i&gt;now, &lt;/i&gt;win or lose. Put some teeth behind We Love The Internet and The Internet Loves Us.

I asked Clark a question, to see if he had an idea that money might not be such a big issue in this election and future elections. This is an idea Lessig tried to explain in his Lydon interview, and that I've been saying over and over. Now Jeff Jarvis has echoed the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2003/12/18/theory_blues.html&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt; Jay Rosen -- the campaigns, while they use the Internet, are one-way not two-way. That's what I was hoping Clark would say, and he almost did. Got a lot of good pictures, not sure how I want to present them yet. Clark has become a much more compelling candidate since the last time I saw him, before BloggerCon, in Sept. Gephardt, imho, was going through the motions. Lots of laborers there. He talked about jobs and health care. Clark almost gave a schpiel about the First Amendment. He's getting close to where I want a candidate to be. Also, I really feel he could beat Bush, if he can win the nomination. I had audio, but somehow the Rhomba decided to format itself, and in doing so, wiped out the recordings.

Todd says that iTunes is the wrong model because it commoditizes music, with every tune priced at 99 cents. He's the guy to look to for the killer app in online music, he's always been first. I played a Rundgren &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicksfix.com/helloits.htm&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; at last week's webcast and people groaned &quot;Oh that's 80s music.&quot; What I didn't say is that's music from the guy who could figure out how music on the Internet works as an art. (And besides that, it was &lt;i&gt;70s&lt;/i&gt; not 80s music.) This week I played a Rundgren-produced song, and the kids liked it. He was one of my heroes in the 70s and 80s, and then later when personal computers took off I got to hang out with him in San Francisco. " created="Fri, 19 Dec 2003 22:49:19 GMT" type="outline"/>

Here's how you'd cook it. When Atom starts settling down, make a list of features it has that aren't present in RSS 2.0. Then copy the RSS 2.0 spec, creating a new document. Do a search and replace, changing the string RSS to MCS. Replace the Roadmap section with a single acronym, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=tbd&quot;&gt;TBD&lt;/a&gt;. Then carefully add all the features on the list generated in part 1. Then as Atom changes, change the MCS draft spec to include the new features and remove the deprecated ones. Of course this is a joke, I have no plans to actually do it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Fri, 19 Dec 2003 19:39:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

This guy has been standing in the middle of the Syndication developer community, squarely, and doing what's right. Note that I didn't say Atom or RSS, I said Syndication. Because if you pop up a level, in some sense, it doesn't matter what the format is, what matters is that there's agreement on the format, and that technologists don't try to divide the world based on compatibility, as they so often do." created="Wed, 17 Dec 2003 14:10:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On the Atom-Syntax list, RCM said: &quot;In the next month, I'll present a framework based on Atom API called PaSSAPI that will implement both the Atom syntax and RSS over the Atom API. Then you can choose to do whatever pleases yourself.&quot;" created="Wed, 17 Dec 2003 14:14:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Choosing &lt;i&gt;whatever pleases yourself&lt;/i&gt; sounds good on paper, but in practice it's bad. The #2 cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://top10.scripting.com/whyRssRules?item=2&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/a&gt; about RSS is that you can implement it in an afternoon. An API based on doing Whatever Pleases Yourself is something only a large company can &lt;i&gt;pretend&lt;/i&gt; to implement, because no one can fully implement such an API. No one will believe that a sole practitioner or even a smallish team could cover all the variability in a platform like OpenDoc or SOAP, or what Atom is shaping up to be." created="Wed, 17 Dec 2003 14:15:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you want it to really fly, simplify. Use the guideline if it can't be implemented in an afternoon, it isn't going to fly. The Blogger API and the MetaWeblog API both could be implemented that quickly. Imho, the smartest thing would be to require XML-RPC, and then forget about SOAP and REST. "/>
					<outline text="We've already heard from people who flip it around, force every tool to support SOAP and REST and make XML-RPC optional, but none of them have anything invested in the installed base, so of course they want to change everything. Anyone who had already implemented the Blogger API or the MetaWeblog API would want to keep their investment."/>
					<outline text="Even when a big established platform vendor does something like this, it usually fails. I've seen Apple, Microsoft even IBM try. Only in very unusual circumstances do you get enough support from developers to make an incompatible corner-turn, a discontinuity. Even Mac OS X had to run unaltered Mac apps. Learn from them, Luke; don't repeat the mistakes."/>

Both must be able to read them and make sense of them, in all contexts, and do so easily. While it seems reasonable that a description may contain markup, it also seems reasonable that a title should not. So, if I were writing a validator for RSS, and encountered markup in a title, I'd warn the author that many processors would not be happy about this and it would be safer to strip the markup from the title.

That's why when I stare at the code that does the string comparison to decide if it should be routed to the other location, it looks so right. Okay, now I'm going to add code that changes all 160s to 32s and see if it works. Yes, that did the trick. Maybe someone can explain why I'm getting 160s but right now I don't care, I want to catch my breath and get ready for 7PM.

When I was sixteen, I worked for the McGovern campaign. I canvassed door to door in Queens, handing out literature and talking to voters about the candidate. I addressed envelopes, and on election day helped people get to the polling place. McGovern was the last campaign worth working for, imho. The Republicans, in my lifetime, have never nominated a candidate worth working for. So when the Republicans boast, at this early stage, they may make it a matter of pride for some who are ambivalent about Dean and the rest of the Democrat field. We vote, we have money, and we care about our country, much more than Agnew, Mitchell, Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman and the rest of the Republicans who &quot;won&quot; in 1972.

					<outline text="Some things are starting to fit into place. From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abanet.org/lpm/magazine/articles/v29is8an4.shtml&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; above, it's clear now that the difference between readers and aggregators isn't new, it goes back to the difference between My.Netscape and My.UserLand. In the former, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/gifs/myNetscapeScriptingNews.gif&quot;&gt;each feed&lt;/a&gt; was considered its own independent thing; My.UserLand flowed all feeds into &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/images/manilaNewbies/syndicationNewsStoryListImage.gif&quot;&gt;one flow&lt;/a&gt;. (My.UserLand &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/bryanOnTheDesktop.gif&quot;&gt;migrated&lt;/a&gt; to become the aggregator in Radio.) To me (and I've said this before) the My.UserLand approach is more leveraged for the human, because the former approach still makes you &lt;i&gt;go somewhere&lt;/i&gt; to find &lt;i&gt;the new stuff.&lt;/i&gt; True, the &quot;somewhere&quot; is all in one app, but it's still work you have to do, instead of the computer. " created="Thu, 11 Dec 2003 13:52:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then another dichotomy is exposed. Quite a few Movable Type bloggers start things called linkblogs, or remaindered links, whatever you call them, they're working around the model of longish posts with lots of visual overhead (a model also implemented by Blogger, Manila and Radio, so this isn't a dig on MT). What if you just want to link to something, should that require a whole post with all its attributes? It's a matter of user interface in the end. If MT made it easy to post and update a news item that was link-blog-like, people wouldn't need to invent a way around it. But that would break the relationship between the feed and posts.

Of course, since we went first with Radio, it's very very easy for Radio users, just click on an orange XML coffee &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001015/images/xmlCoffeeCup.gif&quot;&gt;mug&lt;/a&gt;, where it's available, and confirm that you want to subscribe, and it's done. No copy-paste. Nothing complicated. If we wanted we could have made the url invisible, but we decided that would be too confusing. Now what's the general solution that works for everyone all the time? This is one of those times when, if Microsoft, Apple and Linux could get together, they could upgrade the Internet in a nice way. Probably just Microsoft alone could do it (the others would have to follow). Choose a port which is the Subscription Manager port. Say it's 5350, a random unassigned port. Then when you want to say &quot;click here to subscribe to this website&quot; include a link that looks &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:5350/subscribe?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. Since the OS has the Subscription Manager running on that port, it would confirm that you really want to subscribe, and then add the URL to the Desktop Database (on the Mac) or the Registry (Windows) or /usr/subs (Unix). Or whatever. Some place that the aggregators running on the system could watch. Yeah, it makes sense for some part of the aggregation system to migrate into the OS. If any of the OS vendors want advice on this, let me know. " category="/Technology/Formats and Protocols/RSS" created="Sun, 07 Dec 2003 19:26:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

Many of the first steps are in place. For example, every category is also a feed. Here's the Fun/Songs category &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/cats/Fun/Songs&quot;&gt;in HTML&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/cats/Fun/Songs.xml&quot;&gt;in RSS&lt;/a&gt;.

My hope is that users will be able to participate in the discussions if they're sufficiently interested, esp librarians and information architects. We're not talking about format design, or why OPML as a format is or is not good. Not a debating list. We &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; talking about applications and cleaning up loose ends.

It's a very beautiful ship, very nice. The second &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/international/worldspecial/27LIST.html?ex=1385355600&amp;en=1fa37d9cc6c8ca0f&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is the daily report of US soldiers killed in Iraq. Yesterday only one soldier died, David Goldberg, 20, an engineer in the Army reserve, based in Layton, Utah. Needless to say he won't be going to the Republican National Convention or riding on any cruise ships. " created="Mon, 01 Dec 2003 06:28:01 GMT" type="outline"/>

Perhaps the Republicans got wind of her trip and decided to upstage her? Can you imagine the giggles in the Oval Office. How unseemly, given that Americans are dying every day in Iraq. I don't think these guys get it. And remind me please, why Iraq, of all countries? Why not China or Burma or East Timor? Or South Africa, Liberia, Ghana or Namibia? The Ukraine or Georgia? What about Argentina? Venezuela? Mexico? Pakistan and India. Is Iraq the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; country that needed our help? Couldn't our billions have done more good elsewhere? Did so many Americans have to die? Is it a coincidence that we have an Oil Company President? I'm sorry. This shit is keeping me up at night. Forget about stupid, they must think we're total complete morons to fall for this bullshit. One more thing, how are we going to get out? I can only think of one way, elect a Democrat who makes an explicit pledge to do exactly that. The Democrats are pretty gutless. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sharptonexplore2004.com/&quot;&gt;Al Sharpton&lt;/a&gt; puts it well. By fighting for the center the Democrats have lost Congress, the Senate, the White House and the Supreme Court. Maybe it would be a good time to actually stand for something?
