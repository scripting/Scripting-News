				<outline text="After a full week of intense politics, I'm getting a little time to write some code this evening. What a relief. The first thing I did was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/aNeatRadioUtility.gif&quot;&gt;write a script&lt;/a&gt; that adds 10 random songs to the queue.

				<outline text="Apple and Mac OS X">
					<outline text="It had been a long time since I'd seen an Apple booth. They have one at Seybold. It's huge. But for the first time in my experience, there were no developer products there. At the evening session David Biedny asked if anyone noticed that there are no more user's groups. I hadn't. Did anyone notice that there are no more developers? &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; I noticed."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://macosxcarbon.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$17&quot;&gt;At the same time&lt;/a&gt;, with Tim Paustian's help, we're getting close with the Mac OS X &quot;carbonized&quot; version of Frontier. Wouldn't it be interesting if we shipped a beta on the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maccentral.com/news/0008/29.keynote.shtml&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; that Apple shipped the beta of Mac OS X? Isn't it interesting how the perception is still that there's no new development for Mac, when the reality is that there is? "/>
					<outline text="Look at how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://macosx.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Mac OS X Weblog&lt;/a&gt; talks about Frontier, as if apologizing to the people who read the site that they like our software and think it's cool. I wonder how many Mac users know about Manila? Wouldn't it be great if Apple were proud of what we did with their platform? (BTW, Frontier for Mac OS X supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/&quot;&gt;SOAP 1.1&lt;/a&gt;, client and server. Even if you don't think serving hundreds of easy to use, browser-based content-managed websites from a single Mac is cool, think of the strategic options that are opened by having your system participate in the network being built by all the big &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1849803.html?tag=st.ne.1002.srchres.ni&quot;&gt;e-commerce&lt;/a&gt; technology vendors.)"/>

				<outline text="Airbag conferences">
					<outline text="I asked some friends if there are any shows that are leading edge and exciting like the West Coast Computer Faire was in the early 80s, or MacWorld Expo in the mid-80s. A show where there are 20 new ideas, and when it's over you can't wait for the next one. Can there really be no exciting shows like that? "/>
					<outline text="Another way of asking the same question. Is it all about money now? I asked Lance Knobel who did the program last year at Davos if we could do an adult developer conference, one where there's some heat on stage. He asks if the market for tech conferences is over-crowded. I don't think there are many technology conferences. I see lots of airbag conferences. And pyramid scheme conferences. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/timBrayOnAirbagConferences.gif&quot;&gt;Tim Bray&lt;/a&gt; has something to say about airbag conferences."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20583&quot;&gt;Micah Alpern&lt;/a&gt; says that MacHack is not an airbag conference. It's true, even though it has a little company-townness to it, or at least it did when I spoke there in 1997."/>
					<outline text="http://www.airbag.com/ takes you to a suitably vaccuous site."/>
					<outline text="And believe it or not there was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ict.fhg.de/english/airbag98.html&quot;&gt;Airbag Conference&lt;/a&gt;, in Germany in 1998."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="The issue with O'Reilly">
					<outline text="Offlist I'm emailing with Tim O'Reilly. He says we should run a survey asking who's more popular. So here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/run/dave@userland.com/aPopularityContest&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. Who do you like better, me or Tim O'Reilly? BTW, in yesterday's popularity &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/chooseAPresident&quot;&gt;contest&lt;/a&gt;, Jimmy Carter was the overwhelming choice for President of the last generation whose values most match yours. I feel good about that, because he was my choice too. Even though, when he was president I hated him. Go figure. (The same thing happened with Harry Truman.)"/>
					<outline text="BTW, if I ran a conference I probably wouldn't like it if people called it captive. But if I ran a software company I know I wouldn't like it if people called us closed or proprietary. I'm just giving the shoe another foot to be on. The other day I went out of my way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/29#onOreilly&quot;&gt;tiptoe&lt;/a&gt; around the central issue I have with O'Reilly, and took a direct uncensored &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/08/29#rockAndRoll&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft. As usual, the conversation with Microsoft continues, in fact there are people at Microsoft who agree with me. "/>
					<outline text="We're still at Defcon 1 with O'Reilly. My request to O'Reilly is that they ease up on me. I will continue to say what I think. They're a big company with a highly visible leader. They're big enough and important enough that they will be criticized. It's possible that I'm the first to do this, it sure feels that way from the reaction I get from the O'Reilly people. But as your company grows, more people will have more to say about it. Some people think that's a good thing, I happen to be one of them. BTW, my company gets a lot of criticism. I know it can be hard to listen. But I try, the best I can, and even point to my critics, when it's not too uncomfortable. "/>
					<outline text="So dear readers, it's time to stop tiptoeing around the central issue with O'Reilly. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$916&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of their &quot;RSS 1.0&quot; proposal on Saturday. The case is pretty clearly stated there. Imho, they want to take RSS in a direction that's counter to the goals of RSS. The last thing I wanted was an argument over this. I want to be able to continue to say that we designed RSS jointly with Netscape. That RSS is the continuation of scriptingNews format, first deployed by UserLand in December 1997 and joined with RSS in July 1999. "/>
					<outline text="The proposed syndication format takes a new direction. It should have a new name. Then there's no problem. Further, a new format is not bad or good. If there's a suitable new name, and if it gains traction, we'll support it, as we would any Web syndication format that has content support. "/>
					<outline text="With Microsoft, the issue of whether SOAP would be called XML-RPC never came up. Both SOAP and XML-RPC co-exist, there's no confusion, and both have a chance to succeed or fail independent of each other. When it came time to ship SOAP 1.1, even though it's a compromise design, imho, XML-RPC is closer to what I wanted, I put my name on it because it's a milestone in cooperative design, and one which I am proud to have participated in. "/>
					<outline text="Now, the trail of syndication technology is being obfuscated, the low-tech simple approach will not get a chance, if O'Reilly et al succeed in redefining what RSS is. That, simply, is my concern and objection."/>

					<outline text="We're learning how to talk with each other, where the sensitive points are, and seeing how much we have in common.

				<outline text="Napster at Seybold">
					<outline text="Good morning! Rise and shine. "/>
					<outline text="Yesterday was &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; like I thought it would be."/>
					<outline text="The Napster session was professional, thoughtful, and I think quite interesting and useful. I thought the Seybold people would be up in arms over Napster, in the same way they didn't like the Web in the mid-90s. At that time, I was the outsider, bringing them the bad tidings. &quot;The Web is going to change everything you do,&quot; I would say. And they would say &quot;We don't think so.&quot; And sometimes the voices would raise and the so would the tempers. "/>
					<outline text="So why didn't we go through the same experience yesterday when discussing music on the Internet? Well, one theory is that this is about someone else's intellectual property, not theirs, so what's there to worry about? However, if that was true, we wouldn't have covered all the bases, and we did cover them all. "/>
					<outline text="So here's what I think. The Web changed the publishing industry. All the stuff I write is on the Web, and if you write for a newspaper or magazine, all yours is too. The business model of the Web, which caused all the trouble in the mid-90s is still undecided. Ads on Web pages don't make enough money to support all the editorial processes used in creating a pub. But if you're in the publishing industry and you haven't come to grips with this, you're probably not in the publishing industry anymore."/>
					<outline text="One comment from an editor of the Christian Science Monitor, whose name I didn't catch, was particularly poignant. He talked about the model for the newspaper of the future revolving around (what I call) amateur journalism. The power is with the authors now, and they will only get more powerful in the future, he argued. This is a dramatic change in pov from a few years ago. Even I, the radical in Seybold-space, wanted to temper that. People still want to know who said that. I explained what weblogs are, an Epinions user spoke, and we came to an agreement. Music will go the same way as print has. Dead trees and CDs are the old way. There's a new way coming. How will it work? We don't know."/>
					<outline text="A father of a fourteen-year-old said the teens think they will get all their music for free. I said that may change as they get older, or it may not. Certainly &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; parents didn't think the world we were creating would work. We marched on Washington, many of us refused to fight in Vietnam, we didn't like the president and we said so. We had birth control, so we could have sex without having children. All these things stripped the gears of our parents' generation. "/>
					<outline text="So, following that pattern, how the music industry of the future will work, and the publishing industry of the future, will not be our problem, it will be theirs. "/>
					<outline text="BTW, the great thing about music at these conferences is that the AV guys get involved in the discussion. They're all musicians!"/>

He followed me everywhere I went, insulted by everything I did. I bend down to tie my shoelaces. He whines. I call a cab. He whines. I make a cup of coffee. He whines. "/>
					<outline text="Here's the deal, whenever you move, whenever there's a change, someone wants you to stay right where you are. It annoys me because a part of me agrees with him. &quot;See I told you!&quot; my subconscious says. Another inner voice sighs. &quot;We're going to move anyway.&quot; "/>

				<outline text="Rock and roll">
					<outline text="Things are really rockin over on the discussion group. "/>
					<outline text="Something shifted yesterday, I have a hard time putting my finger on why. I think it's that people are listening to each other. Finally. I said yesterday &quot;I don't think we've been doing a lot of listening for the last few years.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Brett Glass keeps bringing the discussion back to the evils of Richard Stallman and the GPL. I think it's more complicated. I couldn't support the GPL for MacBird because it's a poison pill for a person such as myself who makes a mixture of commercial and open source software. When I give away code, I want to give it away with no strings attached, for me or for anyone else. And when I put a price on software that's because I want to be paid for it. I've always done both open source and commercial software. To me it's an honor to get paid for something I create. I'm like a musical artist that way. "/>
					<outline text="Then the subject swung around to why the open source &quot;movement&quot; gained traction. For some reason this discussion happened off the DG in email. I'd like to give my thoughts some public air. "/>
					<outline text="Stallman's popularity is a result of what Microsoft did when the Web became a juggernaut. They attacked. Everything was a threat to Microsoft. They attacked relentlessly. They forced a choice. Become a captive Microsoft developer, or.. or what?"/>
					<outline text="Developers legitimately wanted WORA. Microsoft thwarted them. This was their mistake, focusing on Sun, and blowing off the developers. I expected Gates to get this, but he didn't. They call him a &quot;developer's developer.&quot; Bullshit. Now MS is left with developers who are such pussies they could overlook MS's &quot;company town&quot; attitude about developers. The ones with balls went to Java, or open source, or are drifting around aimlessly waiting for the industry to restart."/>
					<outline text="So don't say Stallman created this mess. No one would have cared if Microsoft hadn't forced a decision. If they had been more relaxed about the Web, let Netscape drift, and stay on the side of developers, Microsoft would have cleaned up and we wouldn't be talking about Stallman or open source now. My opinion of course. (And this isn't just good hindsight, it's what I begged Microsoft to do, publicly, starting in 1995.)"/>
					<outline text="Talking with Paul Everitt yesterday, the Zope guy, I said &quot;We've acknowledged open source, now it's time to have balance.&quot; Let's have the open source developers acknowledge that it's a multi-colored world, that there are Macs and Windows and Linux, and open source and commercial software, and all levels of quality therein."/>
					<outline text="Now, a lot of open source developers wonder what the big deal is. &quot;We already acknowledge you,&quot; they say. They are our friends, and they tell us that most open source developers agree. That's cool! But the PR noise about open source is not in agreement with this message, and the users, press, and investors hear the PR message, and you wouldn't believe the kind of pressure it puts on us. When the initial rush of hype about open source came a couple of years ago, while all the PR leaders were basking in the glory, we were getting decimated. For us it was esp bitter, it came just as we were turning Frontier into a commercial product after having given it away for years, we were trying to get onto solid ground. Had we not been able to do this, there would be no Manila, no XML-RPC, probably no SOAP or RSS either. Or Radio UserLand, or the World Outline, or whatever else we come up with next. The open source hype made it &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; harder than it had to be."/>
					<outline text="BTW, to the open source developers, all our innovations are without patents. We've been blazing new trails on a regular basis for the last few years, esp in the last few weeks, and documenting our work. Anyone who files patents in these areas, and you can be sure that's happening now, will find a trail of prior art blocking their greed. "/>
					<outline text="During the heat of the open source hype, every day our users would tell us Eric Raymond's bullshit about our intentions. They would demand that we release our source code, as if that had anything to do with getting them what they wanted. We were undermined. At the same time Bill Gates was fueling the fire by picking on Java developers, undermining them as we were being undermined by the open source PR. The opportunists on the open source side continued to hurl bricks at all commercial developers, as if we were all self-centered bastards like Gates. I'm sure they knew better, but it worked for them. Meanwhile open source developers, people much like ourselves, ignored the hype, but we couldn't. It was so in our face it couldn't be ignored."/>
					<outline text="Now, I've tried to be an &lt;a href=&quot;http://macbird.userland.com/license&quot;&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; open source developer. I gave away a beautiful program that would help the Linux guys compete with the Mac. It's gone nowhere. The leaders want to take the shortcut, instead of linking up with the Mac, they want to erase it. These are not our friends. They do unfriendly Bill Gates-like things. Well fuck that shit. Let's create a programmer's club, and let's help each other."/>
					<outline text="And to Bill Gates, I'm totally happy to meet to talk with you too. Let's get the software industry going again. It'll be good for all of us. I'm willing to do my part, but you have to do yours. You hurt all of us by attacking the Web so viciously. The right thing to do is to repair the damage you caused."/>

I didn't understand this, while I was saying publicly that they didn't get the Web, they did get the Web, they just didn't like it!)"/>
					<outline text="Apple also controlled the Macintosh developer community. This was a choice of Apple's &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the Macintosh developer community. So when I say O'Reilly is running a captive developer community, the same applies. You have to be a friend of O'Reilly's to speak at their developer conference. I am not a friend of O'Reilly's. And the developers who attend the conference must know that, even if not at a conscious level. Their conference works, and will continue to work, whether or not dissenting views are embraced."/>
					<outline text="I have wanted to be a friend of O'Reilly's, because we stand for many of the same things. First and foremost is technical excellence. That's also, by the way, the bond we have with Microsoft. Even though they play a piggish game with the rest of the industry, underneath it, there's a twinkle in the eye of Microsoft's technical culture. O'Reilly has that twinkle too."/>
					<outline text="Tim has also personally come out against software patents, but the follow-through has been unsatisfying, given the urgent and escalating threat to intellectual freedom for software developers. Open source does not trump patents. The freeze in MP3-related technology is not just coming from music industry, it's also coming from a patent held by a German company who is ruthlessly enforcing it."/>
					<outline text="Like Apple, O'Reilly plays a pretty nasty game, on a personal level. However I'm sure some of this is a response to the criticism of O'Reilly that I've posted here and elsewhere. Tim has told me as much. Even so, had they included our work in their show, they would have found that I give a professional presentation, and am open to other points of view, and don't force mine on others. I think Tim even knows this, he was delighted at the Web Apps presentation we did at Esther's. It's a shame we didn't do a repeat performance at the Open Source Convention, and also talk about how XML-RPC, SOAP and RSS can benefit open source developers. A missed, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, imho. Y2K is the year that these technologies make it or don't. How much more powerful we'd all be if we could present all ideas, without fear. But we're not ready for that yet, clearly."/>

Such patents, which cover a business process rather than a physical invention or a software program, leapt in popularity after a 1998 federal appeals-court ruling upheld their validity. The fastest-growing category of these patents involves the Internet, as companies race to get a lock on nearly every type of supposed innovation. Amazon.com Inc., for example, has patented 'one-click' shopping, and has successfully sued to keep archrival Barnes &amp; Noble.com Inc. from using it.&quot;"/>

					<outline text="To Dan, we could teach them a thing or two for sure, but Dan, they could help us out too. At least in the music industry they let their artists stay artists. In our industry we have to become CEOs and CTOs. I think we both know, we aren't at heart those things. (To everyone else, Dan's first company was called Software Arts.)"/>
					<outline text="Another thing they could help with is giving us the courage to once again charge for our software. Trellix is, as far as I know, free. To me, this is sick. It cost money to make the software. Why don't people &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to pay for it? Is anyone making anything comparable? People ask me why outliners went away. I think this is why.

In a way we've been living in the Dark Ages the music industry predicts. As in Atlas Shrugged, the people who we call thinkers are actually people who destroy thought."/>
					<outline text="Now if the open source leaders want to help rebuild, and undo the damage they caused, they can start doing some of the thinking they're so famous for, and help us rebuild an economy where people are rewarded financially for hitting the sweet spot with users.

					<outline text="This morning a question came up on the Radio UserLand discussion group, and I want to get my &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1192&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; on the record so there will be no misunderstandings later. "/>
					<outline text="The file format used by Radio UserLand will be publicly documented. Others will be allowed to build applications that use the format, whether or not UserLand's software is being used. However the format's name, still to be determined, will be a UserLand trademark, much as the Apache name is protected by the Apache Foundation. This is clearly spelled out in the Apache &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt&quot;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;, see items 4 and 5."/>
					<outline text="We were the first to get to this place, I'm sure most people don't even understand what we're doing. But you will, eventually figure it out. And then, if the past is a guide, some wiseass, or group of wiseasses, will want to take it over. They won't be able to do that."/>
					<outline text="To me the most important thing is our frredom to move forward. I'm quite disillusioned about the Web as a collaborative development environment. The people who say it's a fair environment are often the most vicious. Watch out for the politician who says &quot;I'm honest.&quot; He's appealing to &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; honesty, not telling you about his. Actions speak louder than words."/>
					<outline text="I trust the universe, but I know there are pigs out there. Good fences make good neighbors. This is our format, we created it, our tools and servers make it work. We're open to competition, even seek it out, but on fair terms."/>
					<outline text="So now, while we're still at the starting gate, it's time to make this clear. If you don't like it, compete at a file format level now, or later. We will allow people to make backward-compatible formats, that's clearly a good thing, but we won't allow you to use our goodwill, our copyrighted material, or our trademarks."/>

After six years of developing Web apps, what a joy to be working on software that's just for one user. Simpler scaling issues. No race conditions. And HTML, while I love it, isn't nearly as rich or flexible as the UI toolkits on Mac and Windows."/>
				<outline text="Another reason it's so much fun, the security issues are so much simpler. There are all kinds of open customizable interfaces in Radio UserLand. You can add your own commands to the right-click menu. We could never do this in a Web app, because of security issues. In general, we don't even allow people to delete things in Web apps, even the commands we use to &quot;delete&quot; things, don't really delete them."/>

				<outline text="One more thing, the first few commands in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/images/radiodiscuss/rightClick1.gif&quot;&gt;right-click menu&lt;/a&gt; for songs are placeholders too. When you choose them you get an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/notImplementedYet.gif&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; that says Not Implemented Yet. We will certainly implement the commands that allow you to comment on a song, and see other comments. (There will be an open architecture for implementing a comment server.) We will also implement a command that helps you find other fans that love the song too. Imagine that, using the Internet to find love. Not a trashy kind of love, but the love that you feel in your heart."/>
				<outline text="About the first command in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/images/radiodiscuss/rightClick1.gif&quot;&gt;menu&lt;/a&gt;, I hope we can implement that soon as well. It should be clear to all that UserLand supports artists, because we are artists ourselves. We want to be paid, as musicians want to be paid. In our industry it has become fashionable to believe that good software is worthless. What a terrible turn for the creative art of making software. It would be hypocritical for us to support a similar trashing of the value of music. Our users will be reminded that if you love someone else's creativity, you must support it, in meaningful ways. In our society, this is implemented with money. It's pretty simple. Other people, some honest and some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keno.org/Crippledinside.htm&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;, try to tell us otherwise, but we know better."/>
				<outline text="Finally, for today, it warms my heart when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evhead.com/?archive=2000_08_01_ev.xml#668937&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt; points to Doc Searls' weblog.

				<outline text="The Web is more than HTML and HTTP, it's a philosophy that has integrity. To be of the Web, means being vulnerable. Music is now part of the Web, to our friends who create music, this is something you have to recognize, if you want to create art around what's real. Let's take the next steps, we're all in the same boat, creative people want to be appreciated without being invaded. Let's encourage generosity from users. But first we must trust them. It hurts when people violate our trust, I've experienced it myself, but we have no choice, we must trust people every day. The world wouldn't work without trust. Think about it."/>

There's a narrative in the rightmost window that explains what's going on. Be sure to expand the window fully, don't miss the narrative, it's key to understanding."/>
					<outline text="This is the intersection of HTTP, XML and outlines. This is the unification I've been searching for for 20+ years. Everything on the Internet fits into a hierarchic view. Websites, email, chat, buddy lists, music playlists, presentations, script libraries, syndicated Web pubs, discussion groups."/>
					<outline text="We have a formalization that allows new types to be defined at runtime with user-level overrides. First we're covering all the big standards. Then we'll have a great playground to invent new modes and services. "/>

					<outline text="Another point not to miss, it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$489&quot;&gt;writing tool&lt;/a&gt; too. And through &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$465&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;, writing for this medium is as easy as using the File menu and the Finder or Explorer. (If you recall, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/05/24/editThisPage&quot;&gt;one point&lt;/a&gt; I thought we'd have to change the File menu, but then figured out how to get two-wayness with a standard File menu. That's what upstreaming is about.)"/>
					<outline text="All the XML files it creates are in &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/stories/storyReader$53&quot;&gt;outlineDocument&lt;/a&gt; format. We're discussing a couple of changes in this format with people who are using Radio UserLand. Whatever changes are made, all our software will continue to read the current format, for perpetuity."/>
					<outline text="I still have to figure out how to link this up with Manila and Zope and other &quot;cloud-level&quot; content management software. I want it to build off users' understanding of the File menu and how the file system works. It almost certainly will involve special sub-folders of the www folder, that route writing to specific Manila or Zope sites through an XML-RPC interface. I also want to teach Radio UserLand how to get to websites, through an outline interface, and through its &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$512&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; menu. I write for about a dozen sites. I want to be able to go to &quot;the site&quot; by choosing a bookmark. I'm getting pretty close to figuring this out."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="New terminology">
					<outline text="BTW, in writing about the Radio UserLand scenario, I get into trouble when I talk about servers. Since the user's machine is a server, I can't talk about &quot;the server&quot;. What's the difference between the server on my machine, running at Exodus; and the server on their machine, running at the end of a DSL line or cable modem, or T1 line or whatever?"/>
					<outline text="So I've taken a clue from AT&amp;T, General Magic and LoudCloud, and I'm calling the common space &quot;the cloud&quot;. It's the common space where all our stuff co-exists."/>
					<outline text="We plan to allow an option where the user chooses not to upstream at all, this might make sense for people with persistent IP addresses and big pipes, who want the full-metal experience of having a workstation that's also serving the public. "/>
					<outline text="But upstreaming is there because at this point, most users would be wise not to open their machines up so fully."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Openness and competition">
					<outline text="BTW,  we've reserved the name musiccloud.com. It'll stand alongside ourfavoritesongs.com, and other interlinked music fan communities. We will specify all the formats we use, they're all XML and simple, and easy to support. We don't want an exclusive on operating clouds, we want competition, but we insist that be fair and respectful, as I discuss below. "/>
					<outline text="Other UserLand domains we're going to use for music communities. playingintheband.com and contactthedead.com."/>

				<outline text="A flawed decision">
					<outline text="About the decision in the DeCSS trial. The judge associates distributing a program that breaks copy protection with political assassination. That's a an extreme and unrealistic point of view. "/>
					<outline text="In the 1980s, when copy protection was common in PC software, there were popular commercial products whose sole purpose was to circumvent copy protection. To a software developer, I'm sure it felt like assassination (I'm very sure about this). But to a user it felt differently."/>
					<outline text="There are legitimate legal uses of the DeCSS program. How are Linux users supposed to use DVDs? As far as I know the movie industry has not provided a way for people to do that."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Naked emperors">
					<outline text="On the flipside, about open source developers. I'm happy to work with people on a &quot;Let's Share Our Ideas&quot; basis, as long as credit is given. Open source has become a haven for people who, like patent abusers, have no respect for the creative process. "/>
					<outline text="There are naked emperors in our midst. They don't want you to see their nudity, that's why they get upset when I talk about them. They want to do all the talking. Makes sense, because if we look at them we'll see that they talk the talk, but don't walk the walk. (One reason some people want you to release the source code is so that they can claim it as theirs.)"/>
					<outline text="As Woz warns, the new bosses may not be any better than the old. On the other hand, there are good honest people who choose to make open source software. But their leaders are attaching all kinds of selfish &quot;riders&quot; on their work. In their naivete, the hard-working open source developers are contributing to the creation of another hardened fortress that we must route around."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Watch out for middlemen">
					<outline text="So, in software, as in the music business, watch out for middlemen. If a leader doesn't write software, or generate ideas for software, or respect the creative process that leads to software, stop following. You're selling out your brothers and sisters when you do that. "/>
					<outline text="Ask the questions that pop into your mind. Listen to the answers and decide for yourself. Don't believe hype. Trust what you see. If they ship software that you love, respect that. If they talk a lot but don't deliver much, switch stations."/>
					<outline text="It's possible to be an open source developer with high integrity, I'm sure of that, I know people who do that. But it's not inevitable that all open source developers and middlemen have high integrity. Sorry, I didn't make the world that way, I wish it were otherwise. It can hurt to trust integrity that's not there. It's best to trust your gut, and ask questions and listen to the answers and &lt;i&gt;use your mind.&lt;/i&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Reading Eric's description, and the Register article, it's becoming clearer what Nautilus is, and at the same time it's clearer &lt;i&gt;what we're doing&lt;/i&gt; with Radio UserLand. They seem pretty close. A difference, we're bringing the power of the Internet, as a browsable editable hierarchy, to Windows and Mac users. At least for now, they're focusing on Unix users. Eazel probably does icons better. (Although we have users who can do icons, hint hint.) We do outliners pretty well. And we have an object database running behind it all, which is a important but largely secret ingredient. I'm sure they have some stuff we don't. (Yes, they're open source too, thanks for pointing that out. I love that this medium is so interactive, even at 4AM. My opinion, that and 50 cents won't get you on the subway anymore.)"/>
				<outline text="One thing they will have is tight integration with the filesystem browser, because they *are* the filesystem browser. At one point I considered taking Radio in that direction, but punted. It's a lot of work, for not much gain, because people generally prefer to use the filesystem browser that comes with the OS. That's what Microsoft and Apple do, and Eazel. (Does Eazel have competition?)"/>

				<outline text="Being kind to the jungle">
					<outline text="This evening I'm working on the Bookmarks menu for Radio UserLand. I prefer the name Bookmarks, because that's what they feel like to me. "/>
					<outline text="So where did the term Bookmark come from? That's what Netscape called them. Then comes MSIE, the second browser, and they call them Favorites. They do exactly the same thing. They &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; exactly the same thing. "/>
					<outline text="So why did Microsoft have to give them a different name? This may sound trivial but it introduces confusion in a concept that should have been rock solid."/>
					<outline text="And when I do a Bookmark menu, when I look at MSIE on a prior art investigation, I am reminded that for some people the term Bookmark will be unfamiliar and for the rest of us it's got a twinge of unease."/>
					<outline text="For all I know their lawyers told them they couldn't use Netscape's term, but no matter, someone wasn't being kind to the jungle here."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="A maturing format">
					<outline text="Heads-up to developers who like XML. "/>
					<outline text="The outlineDocument &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/stories/storyReader$53&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; is getting pretty firm. Almost all the files in the Radio UserLand &quot;cloud&quot; are outlines in this format. There's an attribute system where each node has a type, and attributes that are appropriate to the type. When the user edits the outline, the attributes are visible only in a special leader character. There's a Get Info command that interprets the attributes in a user-understandable way. "/>
					<outline text="It's a really nice open architecture, I've been adding functionality along these lines for the last few days, you can easily intermix different types of nodes in one outline, and when you 2click a node to expand it, it does the right thing."/>
					<outline text="Eventually, I believe there will be a developer community around this format as there are now developers using XML-RPC, SOAP and various XML-based syndication formats. This new format is mostly orthogonal to these formats, and it has an advantage that few XML formats have, there's a usable editor that generates, edits, and browses the format. No one has to guess what an editor for this format looks like, because the editor came first."/>
					<outline text="Clearly the tool-first model works better. I believe it's why the W3C-centered XML community is stalled, there are no tools for users to use. No one even knows what one would look like. In my experience, you can wait forever for tools to &quot;emerge&quot;. It never happens. "/>
					<outline text="On the other hand if there were spreadsheet artists today, as there were in the early days of PCs, I bet a great XML format could run under a spreadsheet, something simple that could be understood by all spreadsheets and programs that want to process spreadsheet data. I'm no expert in spreadsheets, but I could probably design a simple XMLization in a few hours. It wouldn't be hard."/>
					<outline text="Same with vector graphic programs, and in fact, such an XMLization &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/08/svg-pressrelease.html&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt;, and has made its way through the W3C."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Is it sticky?">
					<outline text="So, what makes an XML format &quot;sticky&quot;? I admit I don't know. But I've done two to four sticky formats, depending on how you count, I think that's more than many others can claim (except the people who did XML 1.0, who laid a great foundation). "/>
					<outline text="Even though I can't explain why, in a formal way, I think outlineDocument could be quite sticky. Please if you like doing networked applications, have a look at the spec, and let your mind wander into the things you might be able to build if there were a lot of documents in this format. We've got an editor, it's not perfect. But it communicates and it's usable and it will get better."/>
					<outline text="Another thing that makes a format sticky is content. That's one of the reasons I can start new formats -- I don't have to wait for &quot;content people&quot; to support them. Scripting News is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/xml/currentOutline.xml&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; as an outlineDocument. And there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/xml/outlineArchive/&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; of archives starting 7/20/00. All the files in my Radio UserLand &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; are outlineDocuments. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/library.xml&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; of my entire MP3 collection, organized by artist. So if I want to develop applications using this format, there's no chicken for my egg to wait for. And here's the key point, you don't have to wait either. If you're looking for cool stuff to do with XML content, more of it is coming online as the new tool rolls out."/>
					<outline text="So I've never promoted a format without shipping a tool first, and immediately generate content. I think that's the only way to go. That's why I'm a developer who likes XML, not an XML developer. It's a subtle but important distinction."/>

What's most amazing to me is that, to my surprise, our early users for Radio UserLand are doing a great job with the ID3 information. The database that's building on the aggregator is remarkably clean."/>
				<outline text="Also last night I finally read Chris Locke's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedmag.com/re/re369_master2.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Ian Clarke on Feed. Everyone's been pointing to it, and to hear the comments, you'd think Clarke was some kind of raving lunatic. Nothing could be further from the truth. I was struck by a question at the end of the piece. &quot;So it's something more like Yahoo than Altavista,&quot; Locke said. &quot;Yes. That's exactly what it'll do. It'll be like a Yahoo directory. But it'll actually figure out the categories for itself, rather than rely on anyone to tell it what the categories are.&quot; Personally, I have a lot of trouble believing that. I think the secret to routing around Yahoo and DMOZ is to give a good hierarchy editing tool to millions of Internet users, and let the cream rise to the top. "/>

					<outline text="Another loop-back. Someday I must write the story of the users' rebellion that caused the software industry to remove copy protection. It was very much like the Napster debate, except this time I'm a user, and that time I was running a software company. "/>

				<outline text="Radio UserLand progress">
					<outline text="I've been deliberately keeping it pretty quiet on Scripting News about the specifics of Radio UserLand development over the last week or so. We have a great test group, and the program is evolving quickly as we learn from them. We're going to have to rewrite the Radio UserLand site, but that's a small deal, we want to get the software right, get a great community platform going, and then evangelize like crazy men and women."/>
					<outline text="If you want to follow the developments, the best way to do that is to join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/group/radio-userland&quot;&gt;mail list&lt;/a&gt;, or read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/messages/radio-userland&quot;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt; which are public. With Brent back from vacation, I'm switching over to features of the community space that all Radio UserLand users will share. Today we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/message/radio-userland/464&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new version of the built-in webserver, that's a key component for the cloud. We need rock-solid and secure and really easy to understand server performance on the desktop."/>
					<outline text="My biggest conceptual problem now is having a canonical way to refer to songs. How can I tell if two people are referring to the same song? ID3 is not universally supported, and when it is, it often contains incorrect information. Maybe it'll be some kind of heuristic? Or perhaps people will take responsibility for an album, go get the physical media, and make a list of the songs it contains, with correct spellings, and while you're at it correctly spell the artist's name. This would trigger a review process. CDDB is not a solution. Lots of errors there."/>
					<outline text="BTW, when I searched for KD Lang on CDNOW, they didn't find her. Ooops. Later after struggling I learned that I had to include periods after the K and the D. So even at the artist level, there's a need for a canonical name. It would be great if I could point to a song and say &quot;Canonicize it&quot;. Then it would change the meta information invisibly attached to the song to agree with the agreed-upon name of the song. A dialog would appear. &quot;There's no artist named KD Lang in the database, perhaps you meant K.D. Lang?&quot; Two buttons, OK and Cancel."/>
					<outline text="Then artists like Prince are going to give us grief when they change their names, or try to go nameless. Somehow our XMLizations have to allow this too. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Let's have a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$365&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about this. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;"/>

				<outline text="A constant question">
					<outline text="I get emails and DG posts from people who want to know what music has to do with our core business, which is writing tools for the Two-Way-Web. Not surprisingly, there are two answers."/>
					<outline text="First, as we turn the corner into cloudland, it instantly becomes a content management problem. The Internet is a writing environment (a third view, from Jupiter perhaps?). So through music flow, which is something people have a lot of writing to do about, we find new users for our writing tools. I'm a whore in this way, I don't care how they find out how wonderful our stuff is. I'm willing to go where the users are. (And as a music user myself, I'm already there, I want to solve these problems, it's something I can do to make a contribution to music.)"/>
					<outline text="Second, much as the space program provided liftoff for microprocessors, so the flow of music will force us to solve problems that looked large before we had the immediate need to solve them. Tied up in standards bodies, XML and HTTP have remained so stagnant that Napster didn't even use them. Now, while no one's looking, we're going to blast out some new apps for these well-deployed technologies, and tie them into a writing environment and library system that will realize TBL's Semantic Web vision &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the Two-Way-Web vision, so quickly that you won't believe it. I don't. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

The first time I did it was with Jodi Mardesich, when she was at the SJ Merc. I had a source saying that Gil Amelio had been fired, but it hadn't been announced yet. Jodi and I both got our stories on the Web at the same moment, hers a reportorial, and mine an op-ed. This is the win-win. I'm a participant in the industry, and I write.

					<outline text="Surely they must have had the same kinds of debates that the music industry is having now, but they did it quietly.

					<outline text="Jakob Nielsen has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000806.html&quot;&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; why Doc sells books through Amazon and not through Wordsworth. "/>
					<outline text="I have my own theory, well actually, it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.searls.com/pos.html&quot;&gt;Positioning&lt;/a&gt; theory. In every market there's a ladder. A number one, two, and three, and everyone else. Number one and two make all the money. Number three is barely hanging in there. Everyone else is coming and going all the time. "/>
					<outline text="It goes without saying that in Books-on-the-Web, Amazon is number one. Number two is probably Barnes &amp; Noble. Borders is number three. Wordsworth, who I had never heard of, is in the clutter, in the noise, not on the ladder at all, as far as I know. In other words, Amazon is Coke, B&amp;N is Pepsi. What about Fatbrain? They're the uncola. They've acknowledged the ladder by not trying to be on it. What exactly their ladder is called is something of a mystery to me."/>
					<outline text="The reason it's this way is due to the way the human mind works. The ladder is in our minds. It doesn't matter if Amazon's software is better, even if it was worse, we'd &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; it was better. When I stopped buying from Amazon, I stopped buying books on the Internet, not on principle, I believe the others wouldn't rip me off. I'm just lazy. And I'm a product of Positioning."/>
					<outline text="Further, I think I was getting ready to stop buying from Amazon even before the patent mess started. Why? Because they violated the prime directive of Positioning. They owned the top of the hill in books-on-the-Web, and then commited the cardinal sin, Line Extension. That confuses my mind. Would I go to a bookstore to buy a refrigerator? Not in this lifetime."/>
					<outline text="To Jakob, it's not all about user interface. We're in a larger context here. Stop everything and read the Ries &amp; Trout book. It's old, but the human species is even older. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="More on Amazon">
					<outline text="For me Amazon shot itself in the head when they attacked Barnes &amp; Noble with The Patent. B&amp;N owned the top of the hill in cerebral book stores, not books on the Web. I grew up in NY where B&amp;N was big, big, big, and I was a big book reader as a kid."/>
					<outline text="But as a Web guy, it would never have occurred to me to buy books on the Web from Barnes &amp; Noble."/>
					<outline text="I liked Amazon! I used to root for them the way I rooted for the Mets. Go Web! Go Amazon. Same thing. Spending money at the Amazon site, to me, was like voting for the Web."/>
					<outline text="Until they became dirty, then they flipped around, like Daryl Strawberry. There's nothing worse than a brand you trusted that then proves they're no better than the other guys. "/>

Suddenly, you can be a Web site yourself -- a publisher -- creating content on your own computer, using software tools that are both powerful and easy to use to create sophisticated content, and dishing it out to anyone you want. You can be found, in theory, because people know how to find you using the search engine technology built into the central servers where you register.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Dan it's actually even neater than that. You have a URL for your site that routes through a server that's logically one-level-up from you. If you're online, it connects to your server to get the latest content. If not, it's served from the cache on the one-level-up server. "/>
					<outline text="This idea is in the air, it first came up for me eight months ago in a conversation with Alex Cohen who was at Kleiner-Perkins at the time. No doubt other technologists are thinking along these lines now. We're actively developing in this model. And before that we had been planning to do this kind of thing for years.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://mountaintop.weblogs.com/2000/08/04&quot;&gt;Steve Ross&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Almost every article I've read has referred to the sharing of digital music online as 'piracy,' the very term that the RIAA has pounded into our heads. The only problem with this characterization is that it has not been legally proven (And even if it were, I would argue that our current intellectual property laws are relics of a prior era, and should be radically modified.) If Napster were to win in court, and music sharing were declared 'fair use,' then it absolutely cannot be considered 'piracy.'&quot;"/>

				<outline text="Why?">
					<outline text="Some have asked why I told the story of the economics of UserLand yesterday. Instead flip it around."/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; telling the story created an imbalance that was felt in a bunch of ways. How can you understand my POV without understanding that I was writing checks until 1998, and trying to stay in the black since then. "/>
					<outline text="How else could you get that I totally sympathize with the musicians? We think they're getting rich. It takes so much energy to let that myth continue. I want musicians to tell the true story, well I had to do it too. There's no shame here. To solve the problem first we have to know what it is."/>
					<outline text="We're now in the midst of a true revolution. It makes me happy. This is why I do software, for the great open spaces that my mind loves to figure out. It doesn't matter if truckloads of money ever show up, the amazing thing is, we don't need them. It's all going to happen anyway. "/>
					<outline text="So, let's have a new mind bomb every day this month."/>
					<outline text="What's a mind bomb?"/>

				<outline text="Morning stuff">
					<outline text="Good morning and Happy August! Let's have a BBQ, go to the beach, play with the kids, and make kick-ass software."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://community.live365.com/cgi-bin/WebX.fcgi?13@210.opM5aIjpbmu^0@.ee76dcc/&quot;&gt;They're talking&lt;/a&gt; about playlist software on Live365.Com. I think they'd like what we're doing. Interesting, I know two of the people on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.live365.com/info/management.html&quot;&gt;management team&lt;/a&gt;. Small world. Hey they're in Foster City, only 25 minutes away, just like Napster. Silicon Valley North."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/440142.asp?0nm=B25D&quot;&gt;Flip-flop&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Pops creative mission has undergone what Mr. Grazer calls 'a full 180.' Rather than be the exclusive province of the existing Hollywood creative community, Pop now says it wants to make its digital canvas available to everyone.&quot; "/>
					<outline text="OK, yesterday we got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$219&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; with the aggregator smoothed out so it still works if you switch IP addresses. Now I'm going to take another step, if everything goes well, by the end of the day you'll be able to go to a Web page to see what I'm listening to, in real time. So, in addition to a song of the day, you'll have a song of the moment. And it'll be 24-by-7, even if I'm not working, there's no reason my system can't be queuing up the tunes. Right? Yeah."/>
					<outline text="BTW, everything we're doing is open and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/backend.html&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;, shipped in source code, using XML-RPC which is pretty well deployed. In other words, even if Radio UserLand isn't your favorite playlist software, you'll be able to participate, if the developer of your favorite software works with these formats and protocols."/>
					<outline text="Here's a great story. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eff.org/Intellectual_property/Video/20000725_dvd_update.html&quot;&gt;EFF detonates&lt;/a&gt; a mind bomb in court. I agree with that characterization and fully support them. Websites are definitely a form of creative expression, are playlists and software. Personally I like to create mind bombs too, and I am also a user of mind bombs. Keep em comin. "/>
					<outline text="We're still looking for nirvana in Windows music playing apps. In this DG &lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19347&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; I explain what it takes to rule our world from a music-playing standpoint. A simple COM interface. It might already exist? Amazingly Microsoft doesn't do this in their music player app. I thought they had scripting religion baked into the company. Where do I want to go today? Believe it or not, COM."/>
					<outline text="Mac users who want to get in the Radio UserLand club early, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://turnkey.dyndns.org/macPlaylist&quot;&gt;Sam Devore's site&lt;/a&gt;. Along with Sean Elfstrom, he really pushed it yesterday and has Macs playing music now. "/>
					<outline text="Where will all this lead? Right now the music industry pays the radio industry to promote their music, and the radio industry pays back to the music industry. In the future, we will all promote the music we love. Alliances will form, artist-to-fan. Some of the more clued-in artists will realize that they could create new art for this medium. I once thought this will never happen, now I think it might happen &lt;i&gt;this month.&lt;/i&gt;"/>

This article looks at major transport-level options and compares how they accomplish transferring XML between parties reliably. You'll find an overview of the approaches of XML-RPC, SOAP, WDDX, ebXML, and JMS as they apply to XML transport, with simple example code.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Brent is on vacation this week, but he's still drinking coffee and doing his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inessential.com/&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt; where he says he reads Scripting News, just like the morning paper. Here's something your morning paper doesn't do, it doesn't greet you by name. Hi Brent, hope you're enjoying your time off. &lt;i&gt;We miss you!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
