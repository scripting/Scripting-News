				<outline text="Just got back from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$154&quot;&gt;plenary session&lt;/a&gt; with Steve Case, Bill Gates, Sumner Redstone and Michael Dertouzous. Gates said they like to do software at Microsoft. Case said they're happy to let Microsoft do that, they are not in the platform business. Redstone said most of the creativity in the world is within 100 miles of Hollywood (huh?) and Dertouzous said that he looks forward to seeing &quot;content&quot; from the rest of the world. Thank you."/>
				<outline text="I wanted to ask Case if he plans to do anything interesting with Netscape's browser, but I didn't get a chance."/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$150&quot;&gt;At the media leaders lunch&lt;/a&gt;, just before the demonstrations on Saturday, I picked the most interesting table, the members of the Russian press corps attending Davos. "/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$151&quot;&gt;On stage Sunday night&lt;/a&gt;, Russian political/economic leaders gave hardass answers to questions of free speech and Internet use in Russia. "/>

				<outline text="Today is Sports Day at Davos, I was going to go skiing, but there's too much snow! So instead I went to a press lunch with Bill Gates. He talked about his new role as chairman and chief software architect, and the projects he's working on. There were some tough questions which he side-stepped. I got to ask the last question. I referred to Bill Clinton's challenge to industry leaders to find a shared vision among competitors, which is very similar to the message I've delivered in various DaveNets, but Gates answered the question as if I had asked him to talk about the value of personal computers, and then talked a bit about SOAP. It was good to hear that he is following SOAP, but I was hoping for something higher level."/>
				<outline text="5:30PM EC: Just heard King Abdullah of Jordan speak. Fantastic speech. Today is his birthday. &quot;Some people wish for peace for our children and their children. This is not enough. We must insist on peace for ourselves.&quot; This is cool. There's nothing wrong with selfishness when it comes to peace. He also called the Israelis his brothers. &lt;i&gt;Yes!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The next plenary session is on Russia. And tomorrow's first session promises to be a real hottie. Bill Gates and Steve Case on the same stage."/>
				<outline text="One more thing before I go hear from the leaders of Russia. The reason I can update the site in real-time is that I have a workstation about 1 minute from the plenary hall, with a multi-megabit connection thanks to Nortel Networks and the space contributed by WorldLink, the magazine of the World Economic Forum."/>
				<outline text="Three days into the Davos meeting I am in the flow. I've got the whole thing working, well almost, I still haven't managed to send out yesterday's DaveNet. Next time I travel I'll have the mail-sending script running on one of the California or Seattle servers. Needless to say there's no time to write that script now."/>
				<outline text="I didn't shoot pics of Bill Gates. No one else was taking pictures, and I wanted to be careful."/>
				<outline text="BTW, if you haven't seen Clinton's speech at Davos, I highly recommend it. CNN only picked up soundbites. I was cheering while I watched it. As you know, I am not a Clinton fan. I'm going to look for a pointer to the webcast."/>
				<outline text="Another BTW, guess who was outside the Gates press lunch, shaking hands, both before and after? (Steve Case.)"/>
				<outline text="Yesterday at a lunch for media leaders we went round and introduced ourselves. I sat a table with Russian press people. They were the wildest most interesting bunch. I have some pictures, but they're still in the camera. The lunch was well attended, even though it was sandwiched between the Clinton speech and the demonstrations (which got right to the doorstop of the Hotel Rinaldi where we were dining before the polizei were able to erect an effective barricade). The other people were mostly editors, publishers and CEOs of big big publishing companies. I was the only web publisher present. Each of us were asked to say what our biggest challenges were in the last year, and what our biggest challenges are for the coming year. About 20 people went before me, and for the most part the answers were the Internet and the Internet. When I got up I told them the story of Scripting News and &quot;EditThisPage.Com&quot;. I said our biggest challenge last year was to make writing for the web easy. Our challenge for this year is to start a million new sites. I told them our new motto (see the tagline at the top of this page) and told them it was open source, they could use it themselves. As long as you align your interests with the Internet, you can't lose. I see this statement as being right in line with what Clinton said. I wasn't kidding about wanting to meet with him. I will try to do that when I get back to the US."/>

He wants to talk about that at PC Forum along with Dan Bricklin, and no doubt we will do that."/>

As you know I am not a big Clinton fan. Now I want to talk with him to see if we're talking about the same thing. I just heard he can't get out of town because it snowing so hard. Hmm. Maybe he hasn't got dinner plans??"/>

				<outline text="My schedule is filling up with interesting things to do. At lunch I sat down at the only empty seat of a group of Australians that included the CEO of Telstra, the Australian telephone company, I am told. We talked about his broadband strategy, they're already an ISP (the largest in Australia?) and are deciding how much further they should go. I was speaking right after lunch, so I had to rush off, but I'm going to look for him again."/>
				<outline text="I attended a session on the size of the universe. Even though the presenters were famous astrophysicists, they spoke in newbie terms. I was a math major, and felt my rusty old math muscles get exercised. It was in this session that jetlag finally caught up with me. I was trying to figure out what time it was back home, and fell asleep while doing that simple task. I woke myself up by reminding myself how exciting this place is."/>

Jack and I bonded in the early 80s over outlining software, which we were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/thinkTank2Pc.html&quot;&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt;, and attorneys and other thinkers were using. Jack called me from his cellphone after the meeting, somewhat breathless, saying that the killer app for Pike, which is a net-enabled outliner, is chat, of all things. He envisions a chat system running in an outliner to organize the work people do in chat. (He says it's become a preferred tool among attorneys to get clients focused during phone conferences.) I see it as a UI challenge, but the first step is to link the outliner to an existing chat system. And that frames a question. Which protocol should we use for experimentation? Are there any chat systems that have easy open APIs?"/>

Some of it was familiar. There were huge selection bugs in IE4 that were fixed in IE5. That's good, glad I wasn't imagining it. And I wasn't an Outlook Express user in the IE4 days (I used Eudora) so its weirdness was totally unfamiliar. When we noticed that I was using IE4 (it could be easier to find this out) I immediately upgraded and everything went back to normal, and the feeling of unease transitioned to a feeling of well-being. All is right with the world this morning. Welcome to The Year 2000."/>
