Bryan Bell, our designer, finally had enough of it and designed a more straightforward button, illustrated above. Since I'm the one writing the docs, I welcomed it immediately; even though I know that later it may be a problem, when other Two-Way-Web editors come online, it's going to seem weird to click on a button named Edit With Radio to edit a document in Emacs or BBEdit.

It's total fun, haven't had something this new to explore at an authoring level for quite some time.

				<outline text="Jason Levine: &lt;a href=&quot;http://q.queso.com/altTemplatePlugIn&quot;&gt;Manila altTemplate Plug-In&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;One of the biggest problems with Manila is that every page is rendered through the exact same master template. This means that, if you want a pop-up window rendered out of your Manila site, or a page with a different background color, or without the stuff that you've framed every other page with, you're out of luck. A few days later, though, I realized that I could change it, and out of that realization came this, the altTemplate plug-in.&quot;"/>

					<outline text="Yes I do hold Jews to a higher standard. Yes I liked Lieberman when he called Clinton on his lying about Lewinsky, because I thought maybe there were some responsible adults in Washington who didn't treat the electorate like stupid children. Now I think it was probably an opportunistic move, he's an astute politician, it got him the VP nomination. Good job Joe."/>
					<outline text="Here's the scoop -- the election was a tie. It's impossible to know who got more votes. When you hear the Dems say they want to count every vote, know that they're spinning (lying). Can't do it. They're not stupid, and neither are we. Come on, this is Scripting News, we know about technology. When the disk crashes you don't worry about every last byte. You're lucky if you get the stuff that was never backed up. "/>

				<outline text="When we're finished with the corner-turn, Radio will be an easy to use writing tool that works on or off the Internet, with a strong bias to being &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt; the Internet, and has an integrated Web server. (And is highly customizable.) Then I think Radio will be where Manila was approx one year ago. Ready for feature-refinement, a simple-enough base for growth, and thankfully few of the scaling issues that come with operating thousands of free sites. There's a very pragmatic reason for P2P my friends. It's nice to use the CPUs on the users' machines to render content (we'll get to that in March 2001). This goes to the question that Doc asked this morning. Doc man, you should interview &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/&quot;&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;, and ask him about the dark matter at the edges of the universe (oops I meant Internet). First we give the power to the people (the PC revolution) then we centralize it (the Internet) then we give the power to the people (P2P) but this time we give them networking too. A conceptual hula hoop. Round and round and round. &lt;i&gt;It's an alien plot!&lt;/i&gt;"/>

Having a logo of course is not the same thing as having the site ready to roll out. We're doing this site to put a friendly face on the directory structures created &quot;behind the scenes&quot; by Scripting News people. Others can build directory portals in any other scripting environment running on the Web, or even in a P2P way, in software running on the user's desktop machine.

				<outline text="This is the best Thanksgiving gift I could get. All the time I've been working with Matt on Frontier stuff, and that's already a long time, the outlining has been in the background. He loves Frontier as a programming environment. I've been struggling to create an easy end-user outliner that also has the programming and communication smarts of Frontier, because I realized in the 80s that outlining lent itself to customization, and that it was all about communication. That's why I did Frontier, and why it has outlining and why when HTTP and HTML came to my attention, I jumped without a second thought. I didn't know Matt when he was a MORE fan, but I read what he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-198.html#lnk5&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about it, and Matt gets it, and Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1075&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; beautifully about what he gets. For several years I've wanted him to look at our software as a writing environment as MORE was (or is). That's why this is such a gift! I think we're getting close. I'm not going to let up now, we're going to do a lot more tweaking of Radio as an outliner, make it easier and streamlined and focused on writing and communicating.

					<outline text="Under the rules of Casual Thursdays, you wouldn't be &lt;i&gt;required&lt;/i&gt; to lie, but it would be permissible, even encouraged, to do so.

My guess is that virtually 100 percent of the people in the audience know that the speaker is lying, so why not find a way to capture that information and display it?"/>
					<outline text="Here's the idea. Give 1000 viewers, on a rotating basis, a new device hooked up to their TV, a special remote control that has a new big easy to hit button, labeled &quot;Blah-Blah&quot;. You can hit it as many times as you want, when you feel insulted by whatever the person is saying. "/>
					<outline text="There would be a Blah-Blah bar at the bottom of the TV screen for everyone to see. It would add a new dimension of unpredictability to TV watching. And the people who spew lies would have to stop and ask every once in a while how they're doing, and then we could all have a really fine laugh if the Blah-Blah-Bar was high at that moment."/>

Bush said no way, Florida is too close. They took it back. Later they called it for Bush. By that time it was the margin, the candidate who would win Florida would win the presidency. Gore calls Bush to concede. A Florida vote counter calls Gore while he's on his way to give his concession speech. &quot;Wait a minute Al, it's not over yet.&quot; Gore calls Bush and says &quot;Dubya, I changed my mind.&quot; Less than 2,000 votes separate the two in Florida.

The networks pool a lot of resources. We have so much faith in their projections. It seems safe to assume that in the future we won't believe these reports so readily, and let's look to the networks to separate their processes.

It's been too long since we talked. Jon wants to know why the Unix world doesn't have an integration architecture like Microsoft's &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1036&quot;&gt;COM&lt;/a&gt;. I've been asking the same question for years. It's not that the technology is so complex, it's not. And some easy first steps are possible, like providing a common interface for applications to integrate scripting. "/>
					<outline text="I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/03/23/perlXML&quot;&gt;about this&lt;/a&gt; in 1998. &quot;Just as the push to do RPC over HTTP via XML has the potential of getting COM, CORBA and Apple Events to talk to each other, an open cross-platform scripting architecture holds the promise of bringing together cultures from every nook and cranny of the software business, from mainframes to handhelds, from graphics people to the folks who keep the Hubble telescope humming.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="So, after sleeping on it, I think there's the answer. Unix is not cross-cultural, as a community it's very insular, and each scripting language is its own culture, and is similarly insular. So they solve the same problems over and over. Apparently knowing how to script a Web site in Perl doesn't help you learn how to do the same in Java, or Tcl, or whatever, the wheel has to be reinvented for every common language. "/>
					<outline text="But certainly there must be some group of serious Unix developers who recognize the value in breaking down walls, it's a large enough world now that that must be possible?"/>
					<outline text="On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailpages.scripting.com/2000/11/03&quot;&gt;current mail page&lt;/a&gt;, Jan Gray, formerly of Microsoft, explains that insularity is a feature of programmers, not any specific flavor of programmer. &lt;i&gt;I agree.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Joel Spolsky, also an ex-softie, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$133&quot;&gt;his own view&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft architectures. &quot;Five years after Altavista went live, and two years after Larry Page and Sergei Brin actually invented a radically better search engine, Microsoft is pretending like there's no way to search on the Internet and they're going to solve this problem for us.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="I'm actually kind of bummed about the industrification of Napster. They're going to miss the big apps that could happen if we could freely play with music on the Net. Napster just captures one mode of music use on the Internet. I really really still want to have a song of the day on Scripting News. It would just play when you come here. Don't worry about the bandwidth, it's a perfect bootstrap for the Virtual Bandwidth idea we've been kicking around. I'd choose the song, and that would create an XML file, and in the middle of the night your machine would download the MP3 it points to, to your last-yard system. "/>

Now it's nice to enjoy their enthusiasm, vicariously. I'm going to have to think about &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; I hate trade shows. Maybe I don't anymore?"/>
				<outline text="I walked into InternetWorld in NY last week, walked out in a minute (before paying the $50), sat down outside (the weather was gorgeous for October in NY) and asked myself if I really wanted to go back in.

				<outline text="On my walk yesterday I heard a political commercial for a local California race, the narrator was Bill Clinton. What surprised me was how much I liked hearing his voice. Now you gotta know I don't like Bill Clinton, or so I thought. When I think of voting against Gore it's largely (I find by probing my psyche) a vote against Clinton. So this tells you how bad both Bush and Gore are. To me, they make Clinton look good.&lt;i&gt; Oy.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Another reason why I want to vote against Gore. He's connected to the people in Silicon Valley, who in my humble opinion, have done the most damage to the technical culture of the software industry. I want to vote against these people, the more powerful they get in Washington, the more my creative work will be subject to their lunacy. A vote for Bush is of course, no answer to this. He's probably even worse, even though he hasn't been coming to the Valley for as long as Gore has."/>

					<outline text="This adds confusion for sure. Each of the new environments continues the tradition started with Hypercard. Some are good at running apps, but have no developer tools. Some are pretty and others stark and colorless. No single offering does everything that's needed. They're all trying to do the same thing, imho -- be the next platform, or surface, to insert new code between the user and the Internet.

And Microsoft took over the market without opposition."/>
