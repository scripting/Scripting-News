				<outline text="Nitfix.

This may not be permanent, or we may bring it back as an invitation-based thing. I do want discussion of what I say here. But it's been too much work for me, I need a break, badly. So we're going to take a rest, and perhaps develop new paths for discourse."/>

				<outline text="Looping back to Apple. ">
					<outline text="Apple Apple Apple. I can't believe what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/appleStockGraph.gif&quot;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt; to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; in the last couple of days. I've never seen anything like it. When I see a company that I produce software for hit such a snag, I look for opportunity. As a developer I've never cared about things like stock prices, and if the company ships a product that customers don't buy enough of, so what? Clearly there's a discernable process going on at Apple. I don't know the insider view of it, but I see a stream of products, that tells me that there are more coming, for sure."/>
					<outline text="Now the stock market has its reasons to panic, but for a developer this is a clear buy signal. It's also a puzzle. What could we give Apple that would allow them to sell their hardware in new ways? We are doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; for their platform that gives it new uses as a Web server. Any week we should have the beta of the Mac OS X version. Is this a good time to announce a new use for their platform? That would be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21783&quot;&gt;lemonade&lt;/a&gt; approach."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1996/01/08/gottabearetha&quot;&gt;In early 1996&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a piece for Upside where I pretended I was the CEO of Apple (this was before Jobs came back) and outlined my plan. There are some elements of my plan that Jobs et al have been executing fantastically.They didn't buy a song, but they did produce the machine I described, it's the iMac. They nuked CyberDog and OpenDoc as I would have, and cleared up the positioning, they make computers now, not system software, or anything else. "/>
					<outline text="Apple's developer story is &quot;Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia.&quot; Little air cover for others. And most important, in light of the stock collapse, they didn't smooth out the distribution problems, and they're tough, when you hit a bump, it shows up in the profits, quickly."/>
					<outline text="I think the market doesn't understand this. Apple just hit a glitch. It'll be easy to get back on track. If I played the stock market (I don't) I would buy AAPL now. If I were a developer (I am) I'd probe Apple to see if there's some new opportunity to invest in each other, based on support for each others' products. I've said it many times, my relationship with Apple only works when I'm selling their hardware and they're selling my software."/>
					<outline text="Another question. There are always outages, and doesn't hurt to ask why. Is there an independent developer mail list for the Macintosh? There used to be a few. Are they still there? Or should we start a new one at eGroups? I'd be willing to invest a few cycles in such a list."/>

					<outline text="I was interviewed for this piece. I understand why Salon is doing this, their market cap is &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=saln&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;$21 million&lt;/a&gt; and Vignette's is &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=vign&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;$6 billion&lt;/a&gt;. And with all due respect to Vignette, it's quite possible that Salon's software does more and does it better than Vignette's. However.."/>
					<outline text="The real value of Salon, as I have said in the past, is in their unique reputation for journalism that's Web-only. They have the best name, but others are catching up. Eventually content management software will be a deep and competitive category, priced in the professional software range, like PhotoShop or Quark XPress. At that point, it's hard to imagine that Vignette will be worth so much."/>
					<outline text="In a few years the market will figure out that the Web is a publishing medium, and a great pub like Salon will be worth a lot more than $25 million. Sure they have an immediate problem to solve, to get more cash in to survive the crunch. It's possible that spinning out the CMS will do that. But please focus on the value of your journalistic name, longterm, imho, that will be worth much more."/>

I would have met with them earlier if the RSS community hadn't been locked up, now I regret not meeting with them earlier.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21722&quot;&gt;OK, I acknowledge that&lt;/a&gt;. I am just a human being, and as such, I am tired of people I don't know telling me what my opinions are. I find it boring, irrelevant, powerless and humiliating. I have a lot of practice with this, for some reason strangers often want to define me, and usually not in nice ways. "/>
					<outline text="This is one of the flaws of the human mind. When it doesn't have enough information, it interpolates, filling in missing details, and very often getting it wrong.

				<outline text="Does your university define you?">
					<outline text="Talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmethods.com/about.html&quot;&gt;James Hong&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, we got around to the subject of universities."/>
					<outline text="How did we get there? Well I said there are two types of smart people -- ones who think everyone else is stupid, and ones who think everyone else is smart. (This is of course an over-simplification. No need to flame me, I already know it.)"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, both attitudes are wrong. The former cuts you off from good ideas and insights from other people. And the latter leads to disappointment, as you bet on the intelligence of other people, only to find out that most people aren't as smart or kind or good as you think they are."/>
					<outline text="However, if I have to choose, I'd rather be in the latter group, not the former. Occasionally you meet a bright person and they're just a delight to know. James is one of those people."/>
					<outline text="Then I told him a story about a Harvard professor who spoke before me at Davos. He's very celebrated, lots of prestigious awards and titles, presumably lots of people telling him how smart he is. But what an arrogant man! So dismissive of other points of view. So frustrating to talk with."/>
					<outline text="James said that's the Harvard attitude. (He went to UC-Berkeley.) This morning I spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;Alex Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced me to James and his brother Tony, and he verified that Harvard is famous for producing Category 1 smart people. I didn't know this. "/>
					<outline text="Alex is a professor at Berkeley. We talked about school culture, I said I went to UW-Madison and asked what Madison is known for. &quot;Community,&quot; says Alex. &quot;Maybe that's why I liked Madison so much,&quot; I said."/>
					<outline text="We agreed that the cultures of Madison and Berkeley are compatible. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Two written pieces">
					<outline text="As we approach the end of September, I have two writing projects, one easy, and one not so easy."/>
					<outline text="The first is to choose a recent DaveNet to appear in XML Magazine. In the current issue we ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/07/10/whyILikeXml&quot;&gt;Why I Like XML&lt;/a&gt;. It was a good kickoff for my new column, and I wrote it specifically for the magazine. "/>
					<outline text="Now there are several choices for the next issue. There are a lot of music-on-the-Internet pieces since July, but those aren't on-topic for XML Magazine. My editor, Steve Gillmor, really liked this &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/01/theArtOfBeingAUser&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not about XML. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; about XML, but it's not clear that it will be relevant in a few months when the print magazine goes out. "/>
					<outline text="My top three choices therefore are: &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/15/whatIsOpenSource&quot;&gt;#1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/20/whatIsP2p&quot;&gt;#2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/24/opml10&quot;&gt;#3&lt;/a&gt;."/>
					<outline text="#1 is cool because the issue focuses on open source, and there was a lot of work behind that piece, lots of flames and discussions and surveys, and I think it really got to the core of what open source is. There would be a lot of value in getting that piece broader exposure, and it's likely to stand up over time."/>
					<outline text="#2 is probably the best-written piece I've done in quite a while. It uses a corny technique to add authority to my voice, it's quite &quot;columnar&quot;, a touch arrogant, but as some have said, it works, and if P2P isn't somewhat of a hot issue in a couple of months I'll eat my hat. These hype balloons have a way of radiating, at the core of the industry we might have moved on, but in Peoria they'll still be talking about it, if it works like hype balloons of the past."/>
					<outline text="#3 needs a rewrite. My editor thinks the homage to Doug Engelbart will probably go over most peoples' heads. But the innovation described in that piece belongs in a magazine devoted to XML. As some have said, &quot;OPML&quot; represents a true divergence from the current practices of the W3C, and that makes it interesting. It's a readable format, simple, and a good follow-on to the first piece. Now I favor the path that means less work for me. Editing old pieces is not one of my favorite things to do."/>
					<outline text="As I'm thinking about this, the tougher writing job, but one totally worth doing, is an evangelical piece for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldlink.co.uk/&quot;&gt;WorldLink Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Lance Knobel offered me a spot, to write about anything I want to, but more formally  than the writing I do for Scripting News and DaveNet. That's OK. I adopt the tone of the venue, but I still keep my Madison attitude. "/>
					<outline text="This project is interesting because the audience is so influential. I envision them as the staff people of the leaders who attend World Economic Forum meetings. I want to tell them something about the Internet that will shift their point of view, get it focused on the real benefits of embracing the Internet, not the shallow &quot;dot-com&quot; agenda -- making money off hype balloons. My country, the USA, exports this kind of thinking, and some of it is even in the How To Make Money &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, which I wrote for the same audience and is now out of date, since floating an IPO on enthusiasm for the &quot;business models&quot; of the Internet is waning, probably all over the world. It's time to look for indirect economic rewards of having an informed and participating citizenry. Investing in the Internet is like investing in an education system. As Shimon Peres says, it's part of the necessary infrastructure to attract the dot-com yuppies, Israel wants them, so that's one of their motives to make peace with the Palestinians. I like this kind of thinking."/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I hoped that by writing about this on Scripting News that I'd solve the problem, and I think perhaps I have. In both cases I have editors who I respect deeply and enjoy working with. They both read this site, so the conversation will go forward. "/>
					<outline text="BTW, at the same time Wired is doing a profile of me. That's also a form of collaborative journalism, I have to envision what such a profile would look like, and focus the writer on those things. We've talked about opening a weblog just for the profile, so other people can contribute their thoughts, hopefully not along the lines of these &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/26#ifYouThinkImAHypocrite&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;. He's a smart guy too, and in a way, my editor, but different, because he's going to write the piece and put it through his editorial process, which is quite different from mine."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="My Napster use has declined">
					<outline text="It probably has more to do with the speed of my net connection, which went down about a month ago when I switched off the T1 line, and onto a slow DSL. But it's observable, I hardly ever run Napster now. And when I want to get a new song, it's so slow I usually give up. Is it worth $1K per month to get a fast T1 line to come to my rural home? I think one of my neighbors has a super-high-speed line. Should I become friends with them? Such problems."/>
					<outline text="One more time to the music industry. If only there were a legal supported way to get music from your server to my hard drive. I'm actually thinking $1K per month might be worth it. If you can't make money with that model, get another job."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Disclaimer on politics">
					<outline text="I am an independent, not a member of any political party. I view both the Republicans and the Democrats with equal contempt. In my humble opinion, both parties chose the worst candidate to run for president. Bradley is an intelligent thoughtful man. Gore is an actor. McCain, while I don't support most of his political views, at least got a good discussion going. Why do either Bush or Gore want to be president? I don't have a clue."/>
					<outline text="I saw two PBS programs recently that shifted my view. One was on the history of televised presidential debates. Interviews with all the living candidates. Ford, Carter, Reagan, Dole, Mondale, Bush, Bentsen, Quayle, Dukakis, Clinton. I was most impressed with the meanness of Bentsen, and then four years later, Gore. Believe it or not I sympathized with Quayle. Sure he's Republican scum, but the Democrats were just plain nasty. &lt;i&gt;There you go again!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="I didn't like Dukakis, but he had a good explanation for his response to the &quot;What if Kitty were murdered?&quot; question. He had been asked the question so many times, he had no passion for it, but he forgot that most of the people watching had never heard him answer the question before. A good actor would have broken down in tears and then said &quot;No death penalty.&quot; Hey, at least Dukakis had the right answer, even though there were no tears. (And it was just hypothetical, Kitty was alive, she hadn't been murdered.)"/>
					<outline text="As I was writing this, I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/iDontSupportGore.gif&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; asking me to confirm that I support Gore! Oh geez. I sent an email back saying I do not."/>
					<outline text="The second PBS show that made an impression was one on popular movements that toppled dictatorships. They covered Solidarity in Poland and the movement in Chile that removed Pinochet from power. Watching both these segments exposed something within me. I want to be part of a movement with that much meaning. It took great courage in Poland and Chile for ordinary citizens to want freedom so much to be willing to die for it. I want to see courage in my own country, in my time, but I don't see it."/>

					<outline text="Name withheld: &quot;I just heard a rumor from a good source. The Republican party is feeling that Cheney is a liability on the ticket. There's a rumor that a few weeks prior to the election in a desperate attempt to win, Cheney will resign because of a trumped-up heart problem or potential 'threat to his health.'

Most states allow employers to add non-competes to employment agreements, that's basically slavery. One of the cool things about California, unless there's substantial renumeration, non-competes are unenforceable. I know because I had a non-compete once, when I sold my company to Symantec. They paid me a full salary while the non-compete was enforce. Not a bad deal, to be paid an exec salary for puttering around the house. Now it's different in Washington State, and I understand that non-competes are the usual thing at Microsoft. I'm surprised that the entrepreneurial employees at MS put up with it."/>

I'll get back to the book in a bit, I want to do some of my own writing this morning. What else is new?)"/>

				<outline text="Fred and Sylvia">
					<outline text="I went to a party last night in Berkeley, a CyberSalon, which has been a regular event since 1994. The hosts are two very dear friends, Sylvia Paull and Fred Davis. I've known them both since the early days of the Mac. Fred was the editor in chief of MacUser, and then an idea guy working for Bill Ziff, the man behind Ziff-Davis. Sylvia did marketing at Software Ventures, which was an unlikely name for a company that sold a Mac terminal program. "/>
					<outline text="Today Sylvia is a self-declared agent provacateur, she's an independent PR person who reps &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stallman.org/&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. She also started and runs another salon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gracenet.net/&quot;&gt;Gracenet&lt;/a&gt;, a networking group for high-tech women. She's probably my number one fan. An avid reader of DaveNet, she heaps on the praise, and I know that's not an automatic thing for Sylvia, which of course makes it meaningful."/>
					<outline text="Three years ago, after making megabucks in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canada.cnet.com/aboutcnet/0-13613-7-808013.html&quot;&gt;initial&lt;/a&gt; dot-com &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lumeria.com/fred.shtml&quot;&gt;craze&lt;/a&gt;, Fred started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lumeria.com/&quot;&gt;Lumeria&lt;/a&gt;. Back then Fred was an idea guy. The editor in chief thing didn't really work, but if you ever need some ideas go see Fred. It was for Fred that I termed the coin &lt;i&gt;idearrhea.&lt;/i&gt; He's an amazingly creative guy, and he shares his ideas, prolifically. "/>
					<outline text="Last night, talking on the porch after the party, with a group of very bright-eyed people, Fred said &quot;Software is hard work.&quot; Yup. Three years ago, as Lumeria was starting, I tried to warn him, friend to friend. Things have changed for Fred! Now there's a sobriety to him that's very nice. Software kicks your butt, every time. When a piece of software comes out the other end of the pipe, whether it be a web app or something you 2click on, if it works, that's a miracle. From the outside looking in it must look simple. Like all hard arts, that's the point. Fred now has his bachelors in The School of Hard Knocks. And he's a better friend for it."/>
					<outline text="The Cybersalons are pure Fred and Sylvia. People come for the usual reasons, to meet new people, to talk about their ideas, and to have a chance to say apolitical things. It's nice to grow old together, to have a clan that meets regularly, and shares unconditional approval. We &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; getting older, you can see it on the faces and the stories, and the children who are now adults. Crazes come and go, but Cybersalons are a constant pleasure. Thanks Sylvia, and thanks Fred!"/>

				<outline text="Philosophy of aggregator.root">
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/09/18&quot;&gt;A few days ago&lt;/a&gt;, after running a &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/howHighIsTheSky004&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; that showed substantial interest among Frontier developers in aggegator.root, the engine behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.userland.com/faq&quot;&gt;My.UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to go ahead and release the code."/>
					<outline text="It installs reasonably easily, but not quite as easily as it could, if we knew more about how it will be used. Our needs are special because we're aggregating a lot of channels. How should it be set up on your machines? Let's figure that out."/>
					<outline text="And on what terms do you want to receive it? One of the reasons I wanted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/15/whatIsOpenSource&quot;&gt;study open source&lt;/a&gt; is so that we could do it more formally, in a way that makes sense for UserLand and the community of developers that use Frontier."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://aggregator.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; a bunch more about this on the home page of the new aggregator weblog."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="The code of aggregator.root">
					<outline text="OK, you want me to show you the code and shut up!"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://aggregator.weblogs.com/initialRelease&quot;&gt;Here it is&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="At this stage, I'd only recommend it to experienced Frontier developers. You must have a full installation, including Manila and mainResponder (standard stuff in 6.2.1). If you're not a pioneer type, sit this out for a bit. And who knows how updates will be distributed? &lt;i&gt;I don't.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Lots of questions to answer, but if you'be been itching to play with syndicated XML content, go diggin, but remember to do a backup. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="What changes?">
					<outline text="It's been a while since I've written about syndication. I'm going to re-read this &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/09/03/theDarkSideOfSyndication&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; and share some comments. If there are more aggregators, that might change a few things."/>
					<outline text="A quote: &quot;My company, UserLand, has been working with Netscape and others on a reversal of the Vignette philosophy. Instead of being a flow concentrator, we propose to be flow distributors, with value flowing in the opposite direction, from the source of the content to the source of the click.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="That's a key point. By releasing aggregator.root, we're not acting solely as a flow distributor, we're a technology vendor. If this release takes root (pun intended) then we are providing technology to people who are flow distributors. At the same time we run our own flow distributor. (And we also push content through the network, Scripting News and other UserLand sites are channels.)"/>

It's squarely in the category he describes."/>
					<outline text="Yesterday's discussion on the Decentralization list got to some interesting places. I'm still not sure what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/373&quot;&gt;Mithral's&lt;/a&gt; innovation in P2P is, some people are pretty breathless, I want to know why. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/372&quot;&gt;Clay Shirky&lt;/a&gt; is a believer in P2P as a way of harnessing the compute power of a network of PCs. I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/message/decentralization/374&quot;&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt;, I wish I could see an application that isn't about &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; intelligence."/>
					<outline text="Sometimes when posting on a mail list, I write something that should be on Scripting News. Intel has been trying to hold a meeting of a P2P Working Group. I signed up, of course. So did a lot of other people. It's growing like a virus. &quot;Watching Intel up the size of the meeting room twice, I wonder where it will stop. How many people like me want to be at the summit? Maybe they'll need to rent PacBell Park?? Maybe they'll have to forget about the meeting and use the Internet to figure out what P2P is. Wouldn't it be funny if you needed P2P to figure out what P2P is??&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I'm beginning to think that P2P is exhausted. I know it makes me feel exhausted, it seems like a chance for us to drift again, away from the serious work we've been delaying in building the decentralized Internet at a content level. There's a philosophical face-off. People who view the Internet as stages with audiences (the TV model) and people who see it as something new that's not like TV. I'm in the latter group. So far the money has been betting on the former group. I'd like everyone who writes to have a website, and to have tools for finding the stuff they want to connect with. So far the Internet &quot;business model&quot; has been an exercise in capturing bits behind specific domain names. Instead, I think the technology industry should get back to technology and let the people write the Internet and stop worrying so much about capturing people. History says you'll be routed around, if not by the Internet, by the grim reaper. Remember the barking farting chihuahua thing."/>
					<outline text="Here's an example of the world going the right way. At first I was not happy that eGroups, now a part of Yahoo, started putting the ads at the top of emails. The ads really disturbed me, made the emails look like trash in my mind. As time went by it got worse. Then the ads started disappearing on some of the lists I belong to. Someone paid the $70 to get rid of them. Now they host a million lists at eGroups. If they all paid the $70, that's $70 million. A nice chunk of change. And now they have no stake in our bits. They're providing a valuable service. So charge for it. &lt;i&gt;Makes sense!!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="So thanks to Yahoo for shifting the conversation. The new business model for Silicon Valley -- create valuable service through technical excellence and commitment to customers, and stay out of their way and earn a nice profit. "/>

					<outline text="We did some refinement on OPML yesterday. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/opmlSpec&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; we say that the mimetype is text/xml. That was not well-thought--through enough. "/>
					<outline text="Yesterday we changed the way the built-in server in RU serves OPML content. We now look at the Accept header. If text/x-opml is in the Accept list, we return it as XML, otherwise we return the content of the OPML document as text/html. "/>
					<outline text="This means you can hit a RU server with a Web browser, read an OPML file and see something meaningful. It also means that the outliner can be used to author HTML code for direct display in a browser. Clearly that's what will make the most sense to the user, so we went that way. "/>
					<outline text="However, in the cloud, on ourfavoritesongs.com, we always serve OPML files as text/xml. That's essential for features like HTML directories, which build on linked OPML documents. If this doesn't make sense, don't worry. It'll usually do what you expect, without you having to think about these issues. I'll add a note to this effect to the OPML spec later today."/>

					<outline text="There's been a renewed discussion in the Frontier community about what a developer is and isn't. In my mind, it's not a term to be tossed around casually. Some people who say they're developers are more like hobbyists. (Hobbyists are great, a necessary part of a thriving community, and hobbyists can become developers, but there's a difference.)"/>
					<outline text="Part of being a developer is commitment. This isn't a wishy-washy concept. If it hurts your stomach to think of what you would lose if you gave up, you have commitment. In the 90s when I was an Apple developer, we would analyze every crumb of data Apple gave us. There's an art to figuring out the path the platform vendor is on. Look at pricing and distribution policies. When there's a statement from the platform vendor, take it seriously. Read everything you can get your hands on. "/>
					<outline text="And even when your feelings are hurt, don't let that stand in the way of getting your job done. Now, some people are customers, and that's a whole different ballgame. But we have some developers here too. And they have the scars to prove it. And our gratitude for sticking with it. It's not easy being a developer. I know. I know."/>

				<outline text="A message to Frontier developers">
					<outline text="I'm going &quot;on the road&quot; more, virtually speaking, to spread the news of Radio UserLand to more people."/>
					<outline text="There are some Frontier developers that don't know something important. If you're confused by what we're doing, and you work in Frontier, please read this carefully."/>
					<outline text="The leading edge in Frontier development is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/download.html&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; right now. It is basically Frontier with the outliner on top in the user interface instead of the object database. No Manila, and no mainResponder. A limit of 5 simultaneous net connections. Radio.root and Frontier.root are virtually identical. There's a Developers sub-menu of the Radio menu that lifts the hood, when you do that, you'll see something totally familiar. "/>
					<outline text="If you're looking for improvements in Frontier, follow the Radio UserLand project. All the improvements we're making to the basic functionality of Radio UserLand will flow back into Frontier. In other words, view these improvements as improvements that are coming in Frontier 7.0, which will be released shortly after Radio UserLand 7.0, and will be provided at no charge to current Frontier subscribers."/>
					<outline text="Your experience is needed and welcome. There are already a few Frontier experts in the loop, and they seem pretty happy. The pace of features and fixes is very high. Please don't miss this opportunity to influence the direction."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$1932&quot;&gt;An example&lt;/a&gt;, this morning I added a feature to the Add Link command in the HTML menu. If you use Frontier to edit a website, this functionality might make you say &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; or &quot;Oh Geez!&quot;. I want to know which it is. Often people don't express a negative opinion until it's too late. You've heard me say this before. I'm saying it again. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

					<outline text="Eric Sink: &lt;a href=&quot;http://eric.sourcegear.com/stories/storyReader$20&quot;&gt;Open Source vs Free Software&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting piece. Yes I have been confused and irritated even appalled by the divisive and exclusionary tactics of some open source advocates. But I think it's very clear what open source is, if you stick to basics, it's totally simple, and I beg to differ, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; about freedom, and RMS's philosophy, while understandable, is not, at least not for me."/>
					<outline text="It only gets complex when people attach &quot;riders&quot; or their own agendas to the definition of open source. For example, I was tempted to add an anti-patent part to my definition of open source, but that's orthogonal. I don't think patenting is consistent with open source, but it cannot be part of the definition of open source, imho."/>
					<outline text="Emphatically, open source is not new! Source releases are part of programming. What's new is the marketing hype, and it's not so new anymore."/>
					<outline text="Here's the line I draw. Programmers generally can work with each other. The problems come when outsiders try to grab our work for their own purposes. As I read it, that's what inspired Stallman, and it inspires me too. The technology industry is not about technology. At best it pays lip service to technology. That's how the attention of the open source &quot;movement&quot; got focused on Microsoft, wrongly."/>
					<outline text="Companies. Why does the software conversation always revolve around companies? What other artform forces its artists to become CEOs to be taken seriously (and even then not). Stop everything and &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/05/31/astudioinsiliconvalley#whycompanies&quot;&gt;read this section&lt;/a&gt; of a very early DaveNet piece, written long before anyone had heard of open source. This has been bothering me ever since I got started in the software business. A huge disconnect. I don't want to work for a company. I like making software. Now what?"/>
					<outline text="Most programmers give away source code. Even Microsoft programmers participate. So to draw exclusive lines that disempower some programmers in favor of others could be an expedient way to make money (amazingly) but it doesn't further the cause of more good software for the people."/>
					<outline text="Anyway, let's keep discussing. Every time an idea goes over the wall, in either direction, the wall becomes less of a barrier. "/>

As usual the reporter and the VCs are missing something important, technologically. "/>
					<outline text="Yes, Napster is a P2P product, largely because it puts both a client and server on the user's desktop. In the end when all this shakes out, that much will certainly be required of a P2P app. But I think there are other requirements. To be useful, it must also have an editor of some kind, an end-user editor, so you can easily share things &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; create. "/>
					<outline text="I like to use an outliner, that's why Radio UserLand is built around an outliner. That's why it's good at doing weblogs, hierarchic Yahoo-like HTML directories, music playlists, scripts, pull-down menus. There are a lot of hierarchies on the Web, basically we've created a framework that makes it easy to map those hierarchies on the outliner, and we've provided a few plug-ins that implement some good ones. There's room for lots more."/>
					<outline text="But you could just as easily conceive a P2P product around a spreadsheet, then the interlinked documents would recalculate like a spreadsheet. I'd love to use a P2P spreadsheet, and with the right hooks, it wouldn't have to do all that Radio UserLand does, it could leverage off Radio UserLand through local interapplication hooks, through COM and Apple Events. It's now 2000 and machines run at 933 Mhz. We could start assuming the OS-level connections are fast. "/>
					<outline text="Making P2P work is like picking up seeds cast on the forest floor. It's an easy architecture to build now that our knowledge of networking is mature and the machines have gotten so big and fast, and we haven't (yet) forgotten how to make graphic user interface software. "/>
					<outline text="To think that all P2P software is Napster-like is to miss the point. I strongly believe (not a joke) that the P in P2P is people. Music is a great catalyst, it gets people talking, but it'll go a lot further than that. "/>

He's taking control of his music and offering other musicians a way to get their stuff out there without being too much of a middleman. He's brilliant and an inspiration.

				<outline text="The rest of yesterday's discussions centered around demographics, monetizing things, audiences and all the rest of that bullshit. What if it's not possible to make money on the Internet? Does that mean there's no value to the Internet? A medium that resists money-making. Now that medium might have some integrity. Think about it."/>
				<outline text="I heard about a Web-based TV show with product placements. If you click on a product you go to a page where you can buy it. Does that sound wonderful to you? It makes me want to puke. What happened to art?"/>
				<outline text="And if you think I use strong judgmental language, you should listen to Chuck D. There's value in people with strong opinion. Too many flattened-out companytowners floating around trying to make everything the same. That's what the Internet offers the chance to route around, at a social level. The Internet at its best is anti-TV. In this medium you hear what real people say, not what middlemen think you want to hear."/>
				<outline text="Last night I had dinner with Ann Greenberg, Julian Millenbach and CDDB founder Steve Scherf and his wife. Ann is a VP at the company that runs CDDB. Julian is the Director of Engineering at Larry Ellison's network computer company that Gina Smith is running. We talked about how CDDB works, what their next steps are, and I learned at a fairly detailed level what's going on inside Larry Ellison's mind. Now we'll expand our coverage into these two areas and maybe do some interesting stuff with CDDB in Radio UserLand. I have the big picture in both areas now."/>

				<outline text="Yesterday I had a phone talk with someone I've never gotten along with. Something happened that made us want to settle our differences. My former adversary said &quot;Shit happens.&quot; I thought for a minute, took a deep breath, and agreed. So much of what we care about happened long ago when things were quite different. If you stop and think, what are our differences, in the present context? They might not seem so great if you look at it that way."/>
				<outline text="Talking with Nicholas Petreley a few days ago I said that the problems that open source addresses have already been dealt with. It's true that the old commercial companies abused their power, horribly. In 1993, had I known that there was such a thing as the open source movement, I might have joined wholeheartedly. As an independent developer I had been crushed by the giant commercial companies. Microsoft and Apple did deals that traded favors and routed around our creation, imho to the detriment of Macintosh users. But then the Internet rolled through the desktop, and we got our freedom. Even though Microsoft and Sun tried to capture it, it didn't work. We still have freedom. The big commercial companies that open source routes around are neutered now. So re-think your philosophy, if possible. Can you agree with this statement: Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet? That could be the thing we agree on."/>

				<outline text="Thank you. Don't give in to Stallman. Open source should not have restrictions. Stallman's philosophy is not open source, it's not the spirit of sharing, it's not generous. It has other purposes, it's designed to create a wall between commercial development and free development. The world is not that simple. There are plenty of commercial developers who participate in open source. Python belongs in commercial products. How does that hurt Python? Why should Python adopt Stallman's goals? What has he done to build Python? (Maybe I'm missing something.) I have a different philosophy which is incompatible with GPL, I will support any open source developer who truly lets the source go. Also, I much prefer the term &quot;commercial&quot; to &quot;proprietary&quot;, which is perjorative, imho. (It's possible to make commercial software which is quite open and has major non-proprietary elements.)"/>

Just because people send hate mail that doesn't mean we have to hate each other. Ignore the barriers, in the end guys like Stallman can have their way, inside their walls, inside a very small world. If you can see a way to avoid the GPL, you can count on our support. Petreley told me the story of KDE and it made me sick. They were so generous. Keep it simple. Generosity is good. Period."/>

Instead of subverting an existing system of commercial software, they are creating new, open source software and publishing it. Others are trying to find ways of making money by selling and supporting this free software.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Thank you. However I still think there's subverting going on. Open source advocates are inches away from finding the bug in their advocacy, giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming they didn't &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to hurt commercial developers. There's a lot more to commercial software than Microsoft. They'll have no credibility with me until they start acknowledging that, consistently, and update their philosophy to include all flavors of software. While bringing their logic to music, clean up the act at home, in software. The world is a lot more complex than they have been saying it is. Petreley, as usual, is leading, but I want him to say more about this."/>

					<outline text="The Herring article makes a key point. RSS could be a reasonably high-stakes economic thing if we have a winning attitude. If it stays simple, eventually it will fit into WAP-space, it's probably already got more content flowing through it. With modest sprucing and tweaking, it can grow a lot more, without getting complex. "/>

				<outline text="The political side of RSS">
					<outline text="Yesterday was a heated day in the RSS debate and we got pretty close to my core issue on this. "/>
					<outline text="Why was the name &quot;RSS 1.0&quot; cooked up in secret and presented as a finished thing, before any of us had a chance to consider it or comment on it? The claim that it's just a proposal doesn't cut it. O'Reilly did not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/oreillyPromotingRss10.gif&quot;&gt;present&lt;/a&gt; it on their site that way. And now that we've actually asked users what they think, a substantial number of them think RSS is pretty good as it is. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20849&quot;&gt;David McCusker&lt;/a&gt; came closest to expressing my feelings at the way this was handled. &quot;Who are you again?&quot; "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Moving towards resolution?">
					<outline text="Thanks to Dave Sims at O'Reilly for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/&quot;&gt;pointing&lt;/a&gt; to the DaveNet piece I ran on Sunday explaining my view of the value of RSS and our involvement with it. We spoke for a bit on the phone. This conversation, a frank and friendly one, opened my mind a bit to seeing how it looked from his point of view, inside O'Reilly, and not really in the RSS loop in a deep way. I learned a lot in this brief conversation."/>
					<outline text="Looking at the survey, if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://surveys.userland.com/surveys/results/dave@userland.com/howToEvolveRss&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; stay roughly proportional to the current percentages, it would be hard to argue that the Namespaces+RDF approach is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; reasonable way to go forward, nor would it be reasonable to say that there aren't a substantial number of people who want Namespaces+RDF. In other words, both approaches enjoy significant support. "/>
					<outline text="Therefore, there must be two paths forward. "/>
					<outline text="I would like to be &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of a group of people who work on slowly evolving RSS 0.91 to become 0.92 and 0.93 and so on. I imagine getting onto a predictable six-month cycle, with commercial and open source tools tracking the development of new versions, much as there's a common tool set for XML. I outlined this approach in a post to the FoRK list earlier today. "/>
					<outline text="(I got the idea from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$672&quot;&gt;Rohit&lt;/a&gt;, he was urging TBL to come up with a similar cycle for HTML, and I think this would have been the right approach for heading off the browser wars between Netscape and Microsoft, a fear that the O'Reilly people voiced in the radio show they did a week ago.)"/>
					<outline text="I also think the two efforts should be related. The Namespaces group can serve as a proving ground for new ideas in syndication, and when features in that thread gain substantial adoption, they can percolate into the core spec, without the need for webmasters to master namespaces. Or if in a couple of years namespaces seem like second nature to the webmasters, and they say they want them, let's roll them in."/>
					<outline text="I have my own opinion on where the wires got crossed. Part of the reason is that there are cultural barriers, even within the United States. I am from New York, even though I live in California, I tend to speak with force and conviction, when I think I know what's going on. RSS is one of the things I have strong convictions about, and my pov is different from many others, as are the conclusions I reach and the things I value. But people from the Midwest or The South or California hear something different. And people from the UK too. I have a booming voice, even in email and on the Web. My words may be strong, but when I go into the &quot;please listen to me mode&quot; it's because I have something to say, and I want to be heard, not that I want to hurt you. "/>
					<outline text="On the other side, I think the people involved thought UserLand is Microsoft. We seem to be everywhere in this space. But we're actually a very small company and we don't want to stop anyone from doing cool stuff. We just want to be part of it. That's why we worked so hard to get RSS off the ground. And that's why I got so angry when we were cut out of the process. "/>
					<outline text="While NYers talk loudly, sometimes midwesterners or Bostoners can be pretty mean in response. To Tim, that's the nasty personal game I was talking about. I was trying to tell you about this in email, but all you heard was &quot;He's saying bad things about us again.&quot; I'm sorry, but I don't know how to say &quot;You're screwing my company and our users&quot; in a nice way. And at this point in my life, at age 45, I don't think I want to try to learn how to do that. I'd much rather avoid situations where I have to say it."/>
					<outline text="So let's leave RSS wide open to participation by any people who are willing to work together to move it forward, slowly and predictably. If no one shows up, or the group fails, the worst that could happen is that RSS stays right where it is, at the 0.91 level. And that's not so bad! But with a mandate for slow evolution, nothing revolutionary, no special features for aggregators or other fancy applications, perhaps it doesn't need to be much more than it already is. "/>
					<outline text="And at the same time, let's have a place to work on the Namespaces+RDF approach. I'm not going to try to lead in either place. I want to work on Radio UserLand and related stuff. I would like to think that if my opinion was sought that no one would have a problem with me expressing it. Radio UserLand also reads RSS files in a pretty interesting way. And I'm a good writer and sometimes because of that I can ask a pointed question that might indicate a problem in documentation or usability, or maybe a better way to organize things so they'll be easier to understand. These are the the things I like to do."/>
					<outline text="Also if you give me a chance, I'm good at helping people work together, believe it or not. This doesn't mean I want to dominate or control, it means I want to help. We all have our strengths. All I want to do is apply my strengths in this area, as an investment, and hope to be able to reap profits from that investment in the future, when RSS becomes the monster format that so many people think it can."/>
					<outline text="Which reminds me of a story. (Of course.) A long time ago, just after shipping a version of Frontier for the Mac, the Frontier-Work list erupted in a huge flamewar. I mean huuuuge. A quiet voice, I don't remember who it was, posted a message saying &quot;You guys should be celebrating not fighting!&quot; I remember flaming him in response, in total agreement."/>
					<outline text="Sometimes the tempers get unreal, and the positions so dug in, that you can't remember that it's OK to feel good about having accomplished something important. RSS is important. It's worth fighting over, and it's also worth working together on. "/>
					<outline text="Thanks for listening."/>

I just speak for myself, I am not a lawyer, your mileage may vary, in my humble opinion, and all other disclaimers in popular use on the Internet."/>
				<outline text="So now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://spicynoodles.com/&quot;&gt;Andre&lt;/a&gt; has left us to return to school we have an opening to fill on the UserLand development team. The ideal candidate would be someone with lots of C experience at a systems level, someone who has worked on an operating system or Web server or scripting environment, since Frontier is basically all three of these things. We generally only hire people with experience in Frontier at a user level, that way we avoid bone-headed things that screw the users. The ideal candidate is Andre Radke, but well, that ain't happening. If you feel you could fill his shoes, send me an email, preferably with a link to a resume. One more thing, this time we'd like someone local, or at least on the same continent. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$20741&quot;&gt;Chuck Shotton&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Is there any real reason why application domain-specific programs have to wade into the morass of name spaces and overwrought specifications when something elegant and simple would suffice? RSS 0.91 does have a few shortcomings, but adding a few additional XML elements and associated semantics seems a lot simpler than starting essentially from scratch.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I went for a visit to the mail list where all the &quot;RSS 1.0&quot; stuff is happening, and found it pretty quiet. I read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/message/rss-dev/239&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Libby, the engineer at Netscape who worked on RSS while we were doing the dance with Netscape in 1999. While he supports the RDF approach, he also is clear that without tools it can't work. I totally agree. That's why I think the tools come first, I've even said that here on Scripting News. Ironically, for the RDF proponents, UserLand is probably the only developer that actually &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; the tools. "/>

That's what I love about the culture that's developing here. The barking-farting-chihuahua thing. Yeah, sometimes I write emails when I'm really tired or nervous.

Hmmm. Is it content? That's like saying a great sunset is 'light'. Sure, oh yes, that's what it is. But it misses the point. It misses the movement, the inspiration, the soul-gathering and unification that comes from knowing that 80 million people are watching the same sunset, each in their own way all at the same moment in time, each from their own point of view.&quot;"/>
