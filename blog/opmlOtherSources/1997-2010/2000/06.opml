					<outline text="A one of a kind corporate relationship blossomed, a project we started two years ago. It saw the light of day, and it's exciting, not just for the technology, also because of its humanity.

					<outline text="I agree. The difference after last week's announcement is palpable.

					<outline text="Here's why Microsoft's proposal is different from all the others. It really empowers developers, not just the captive ones, but everyone who has a scripting language that can do HTTP and XML. Especially developers who don't use Windows."/>

If &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-318053.html&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt; had designed the Web around a writing tool it would have been Two-Way from the start.

				<outline text="Performance of SOAP" created="Tue, 27 Jun 2000 05:09:27 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="A common myth is that SOAP does not perform well enough. I've heard this from people who participated in some way in the development of the low-level protocols of the Internet, things like DNS and SMTP."/>
					<outline text="&quot;It won't scale,&quot; they say. &quot;Trust me little newbie, we know.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="To which I say, it depends on what you use it for. "/>
					<outline text="In the early 80s, I never would have done an object database for the Apple II, even though it was an excellent machine with a lot of advantages over the Unix machines I used to use. "/>
					<outline text="Even if I had known how to write an object db, it never would have performed. By the end of the 80s, the machines had multiple megabytes of RAM, so some of the ideas I hadn't dared explore in the early 80s were possible. Today with much more RAM and huge hard disks, the bet on object db technology works even better."/>
					<outline text="Same with scripting. In the late 80s, a script that processed a stream of text could only be run once in a while. Today, script code runs faster than assembler code used to in the 80s. And CPUs are getting faster all the time. Which assumptions will we be able to loosen in the coming years? That's what I'm thinking about now, as is every other professional developer."/>
					<outline text="So the &quot;It Won't Scale&quot; argument only holds water if we apply the technology unwisely. Performance is always one of the biggest considerations in designing software. Yes, we design software for tomorrow's hardware, but if the software doesn't run well on today's hardware, it won't gain traction. And today hardware includes the hardware of the Internet. "/>

Highly configurable, so you can force conformity in look-and-feel, or let your users run wild, or anywhere inbetween. For a very low price you can launch hundreds or thousands of internal or external websites with point and click simplicity."/>
					<outline text="All sites come with free syndication features, and XML-RPC interfaces so you can hook them into your legacy apps and databases. Static rendering is built-in and easily configurable, so it's conceivable that a single NT box could be used, in conjunction with a static server, to be the editing system for as many as 100,000 sites. The ISP opportunities are pretty obvious."/>

					<outline text="(Reminder to self, let's get the Spanish localization done, then we'll be Latin America-friendly.)"/>
					<outline text="Aside from bug fixes and the Linux version, 6.2 is the end of the Frontier 6 thread. The next major release, 7.0, will be Dot-Net-Ready, if that's a term, and ready to serve any and all SOAP-based distributed computing visions. (6.2 will include the latest SOAP for Frontier, but it's not wired into all the existing XML-RPC interfaces yet, it's too new.)"/>
					<outline text="And with 6.2, we're going to launch our &quot;Trial Window&quot; program. You'll be able to download and install a fully functional copy of 6.2 onto your server and use it for 60 days at no charge. You'll get a serial number, nightly updates, and you'll be in the registration database. After 30 days you'll get an email reminder that there's 30 days remaining in your trial window, and at 60 days a notice telling you that sadly, it's time to uninstall the software, or pay for it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

I did that in 1983, based on the advice of a board member who said that big companies like Apple don't disappear overnight. So true.

No one at MS has asked me to back up my claims that we're there now, that we have their vision delivered in a form that the journalists in the audience would have had orgasms over, yesterday, not in 2005. We've got the development environment, the browser-based interface, and the GUI writing tool that shows very clearly why the browser-based interface is the innovation of the &lt;i&gt;last decade.&lt;/i&gt; The old Microsoft would never have let me make such a claim without demanding a demo."/>

I would recommend that Gates go on vacation. Take a massage class. Go deeper into what's bumming him out, and let it go. Find people in the company who think the outside world is friendly and fair, and give them the keys to run the show. There are a lot of smart, young and ambitious people at Microsoft, who want to add something great to the world. "/>

					<outline text="I heard that Microsoft tried to get Marc Andreessen to be on stage for an endorsement. He couldn't make it. Thank god. What were they thinking at Microsoft? How maudlin would that be. "/>
					<outline text="On the bus to the airport I was interviewed by a reporter from Salon, Katharine Mieszkowski. We had a long time to talk, the traffic was awful on 520. She asked why I did all this work to get SOAP going. I had a moment to reflect. I remembered back to early 1998, when I was saying that I had done everything I wanted to do except create a standard. She asked what will you do now? I guess I accomplished what I set out to do. Cause for a pause. Pretty cool."/>
					<outline text="The other day I wrote about scriptability of vector graphics programs for the Mac. I remembered Canvas, who did a lip-service job of supporting Apple's protocols in the early 90s. The CEO of Deneba, the developer of Canvas, got to speak at the WWDC rollout of System 7, even though I had a great meaningful demo of System 7, I sat in the audience. Even Gates got to speak, and I thought he did a better job of explaining why System 7 is cool than anyone from Apple. Deja vu. Today, I could have explained better than Gates why SOAP is so important. And my demo would have turned on the lights for everyone in the room. We're not talking about vaporware, our stuff really works. I'm using it right now to write this piece. Any writer would understand it in an instant. Key point: there were 250 influential writers in the room today. Missed opportunity."/>
					<outline text="Why didn't Microsoft let me explain it? Why did they want Andreessen on stage and not me? I can only guess. When you want to take leadership of developers, you don't want the developers leading the developers. I forgave Apple, and therefore forgive Microsoft, if this is what's happening. I told Yusuf Mehdi that I will keep coming to visit, they're much more disciplined at Microsoft, and they listen. We've gotten through. SOAP is real now. There's still more work to do."/>
					<outline text="In the Q&amp;A a reporter asked what about Netscape and the Mac? Well, this isn't really about browsers, a point which Microsoft didn't make very clearly. I wanted to answer the question for Gates. Don't worry about the Mac, Frontier works on the Mac, and it supports SOAP. So the Mac is a first-class SOAP client and server. Right up there with Java and Windows. There's the power of partnerships. "/>
					<outline text="Gates mentioned Napster and Gnutella many times as proof of net applications that aren't HTML based. I like that. Good job Bill. Lurking in the back of my mind is the idea that we could do a SOAP interface for Napster, and spread out support for the protocol it defines. Any good technologist will tell you that the architecture of Napster and its brethren have applications far beyond routing around corruption in the music business (although that's an excellent application)."/>
					<outline text="Net-net, I am &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; glad I went. My mid-morning essay was the result of being bored and humiliated watching demos of me too stuff. I felt like I was watching an advertisement for something completely irrelevant. The MSN website creation stuff is far behind the leading edge. And it has nothing to do with what we're doing in SOAP-land, or if it does, the explanation was totally inadequate."/>
					<outline text="Ballmer left Apple out of the list of competitors. Had they included Apple it would have raised doubts about the uniqueness of their ability to do new user interfaces. I'd argue that today's Apple has limited resources in this area. Regardless, there's more UI smarts outside of Microsoft than inside. But can all the smart independent designers work together to advance the art in Web apps before Microsoft gets there? I don't know."/>

					<outline text="Press conference started at 8:30AM. Gates is speaking. It's a great digital world, media, business, knowledge workers. Bifurcated. Powerpoint presentations spreadsheets, paperwork, meetings that are purely analog. Can't copy and paste from a meeting, says Bill G."/>
					<outline text="Beyond browsing -- personalized, multiple sites, any device. &lt;i&gt;Reading, writing, annotating.&lt;/i&gt; Natural interface, no barriers between users, devices. XML is the base protocol for the new era of software."/>
					<outline text="It's called .NET, pronounced &quot;dot-net&quot;."/>
					<outline text="&quot;As big a transition as from DOS to Windows.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Storage is out in the cloud. The cloud understands, it's richer, it indexes things, it's based on database technology, it's the XML store. Think about the Windows clipboard. And OLE, that's when Windows really started to become object oriented. You no longer leave the browser, that's the &lt;i&gt;Universal Canvas.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text=".NET building blocks, Identity, notification, messaging, personalization, XML storage, calendar, directory and search, software delivery. These are their toolkits."/>
					<outline text="How many search commands do you have in your PC?"/>
					<outline text="Now we're getting a demo of the &quot;natural interface elements.&quot; Smart tags. Your emailer recognized company and people names. Click on a smart link and get a popup menu that gets you to their website and other places."/>
					<outline text="The Universal Canvas is full screen and looks nothing like Windows. It has a natural langage command line where the URL box is. Voice is part of it. "/>
					<outline text="&quot;You could say this is a bet the company strategy.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I took some &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$802&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; during the break."/>
					<outline text="After the break, we're getting demos of really stupid ordinary bullshit. I just said out loud to the people around me &quot;This is infuriating!&quot; Why did we travel all this way to get a demo of MSN's me-tools?"/>
					<outline text="Luckily I can check my email. Tim O'Reilly sent me a pointer to this Jon Katz &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/features/00/06/19/1714239.shtml&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on Open Journalism. I want to be sure to read this when I get back to California."/>
					<outline text="I wish I had a nickel for every time they used the word &quot;rich&quot;. "/>
					<outline text="Paul Maritz gave a great speech about the role of SOAP in all that they're talking about. Much appreciated."/>
					<outline text="Steve Ballmer is a fantastic speaker! &quot;What is .NET? A programming infrastructre that supports the next generation of the Internet as as platform. It is also, a user environment a set of fundamental user servers that live in the client or on the cloud. It runs on servers behind firewalls and on the public Internet, and a set of services that Microsoft will operate and developers can use.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I want to know why Microsoft is so Microsoft-centered. The revolution really hasn't occurred to them, imho. How about Microsoft using other people's services? Why should we sign on to Microsoft's vision? Hmmm. Hey it wasn't really Microsoft's vision, it was *our* vision. I think they've not really figured it out."/>
					<outline text="Steve says he must work with partners, some advice --&gt; drop the &quot;third party&quot; term. It's arrogant. It's a bug."/>
					<outline text="BTW, people from MS are reading this real-time and sending me comments via email. Keep them coming."/>
					<outline text="Microsoft is trying to make the calendar go back to 1992. It won't work. I'm trying to decide if it's appropriate to say this during the Q&amp;A period. Geez they want to go back to Design Previews. What about W3C? Wow I got a plug from Ballmer. He thanked me and Don Box for working with them on SOAP. Wow. Geez."/>
					<outline text="OK, there's nothing wrong with design previews, I totally enjoyed the process, except MS will be disappointed to find out it's not the early 90s and the world doesn't revolve around them at this time. Emphatically."/>
					<outline text="Microsoft's core priorities: PC excitement, e-server business, MSN, migrating to the .NET platform."/>
					<outline text="My net connection is flaky, and this is a work in progress. Don't consider these comments as anything more than off the top of my head as the day proceeds."/>
					<outline text="Who's the competition -- Sun, IBM, Oracle, Linux, AOL?"/>
					<outline text="Ballmer finished, now Q&amp;A."/>
					<outline text="They feel impermeable to competition in .NET as a platform. They think the companies (and Linux) don't get it, or aren't in the right business; but &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; chose to slice things up that way. They argue that their installed base of developers is a huge advantage. This is sure to provoke a competitive response from some or all of the names they listed as competition."/>
					<outline text="With that I'm signing off. I've got a 4PM flight back home. See you this evening, Murphy-willing. And thanks to Microsoft for a stimulating event. Lots to think about, and more questions to ask."/>

					<outline text="Expect a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnnfn.com/2000/06/21/technology/microsoft_ngws/&quot;&gt;blast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2592078,00.html&quot;&gt;publicity&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2122784.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.ni&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/423257.asp?0nm=-1CO&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="Tomorrow, in Redmond, they will announce their next-generation Internet strategy, formerly called NGWS, which has XML and &quot;SOAP&quot; at its core. (And of course respects the legacy, COM, ODBC, WebDAV.)"/>
					<outline text="Imagine a word processor integrated into the Web browser (MSIE of course) and a toolbar that makes it easy to switch to your presentation program, spreadsheet, schedule, contact list, mail app, draw program, etc. All with a consistent user interface, and deep integration with Web services, that the client talks to through SOAP."/>
					<outline text="And while the code for these apps resides on your local hard disk, they are updated automatically, presumably with user confirmation. You pay Microsoft for this software, but it's a subscription fee, not a traditional software license. (Just like Frontier!)"/>
					<outline text="Some of your stuff is publicly readable, some is not. All your information is stored on the server. So when you go on a trip, with a cellphone or a laptop, or are at a offsite, or a sales call, you can tap into the data, view it, edit it. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;http://howto.yahoo.com/infodesk/&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; with higher-level software running on the client. (This is what Gates talked about at &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet#8&quot;&gt;Davos&lt;/a&gt; in January, the PC is not irrelevant, he said, it's essential.)"/>
					<outline text="Their strategy is a compromise with the Network Computing vision that was the anti-Microsoft rage a few years ago, and will lock into Windows, but do it through documented interfaces, expressed in SOAP. So Microsoft will claim that it is open, and this will be fair, assuming that other developers support the idea not just &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1770721.html&quot;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2033523.html?tag=st.ne.1002.lthd.1003-200-2033523&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; but with software."/>

What we see tomorrow is pure Gates, circa 2000. And it's a new job for him, Microsoft has never had an overarching vision before, and perhaps they still don't. "/>
					<outline text="Of course lurking in the background is the possibility that Microsoft has filed patent applications on these ideas, which are somewhat unique (perhaps, esp in the areas where functionality is integrated with MSIE). The jury won't be out on that for a few years, because patent applications are confidential until they are issued by the USPTO. It would be helpful if Microsoft addressed this issue tomorrow, without waiting for a question from the audience."/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://confederacy.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$4&quot;&gt;Jim Hebert&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;For Napster to have a business model that anyone can comprehend they need to be at the center of it in some way -- the distributed backend which would be resistant to music industry attack has been designed, twice now, and the problem is Napster would write itself right out of the picture if it adopted it. That's their bug.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I took this idea on a walk with me, and came to a different conclusion, after having met with the Napster people and crawled around the conundrum from their pov. If I were in their shoes, I'd want to see thousands of developers implement Napster-compatible servers and clients. Give the RIAA a much bigger target to shoot at. They'll have to sue every developer, and at some point, they'll realize how hopeless it is (every lawsuit will generate more bad PR for them, and who knows what other musicians are waiting in the wings to pull a Courtney). "/>
					<outline text="And it's not just hopeless for economic reasons, let's say Joe Developer who has a tin ear, or even better, is deaf, implements a Napster clone. What law did he break? What's unfair about what he did? I don't get it. Everything people do with Napster could be done with off the shelf authorless software, like HTTP or FTP. All Napster did was make it a little more convenient."/>
					<outline text="Poor Napster (sarcasm) they end up with the biggest brand-name in online music, and the gratitude of music fans everywhere for breaking the logjam. If there are any products to be sold here, the Napster brand will work well with them."/>
					<outline text="I think I could write a fair settlement now, but I don't think the music industry would buy it, but a year from now they will. It goes like this. "/>
					<outline text="All money goes directly to the artists. They can in turn hire music distributors, in a competitive environment, and reverse the royalty system. The artists have a bigger cash pot to play with, and can redefine how music production works, and how it relates to live performances and merchandising. "/>
					<outline text="The creative people would own the medium, as Courtney says they should, and I of course agree. We'll get art instead of flatness. We'll get a chance to evolve through one of our most creative artforms, and one that the Internet is ready to serve now. And we'll get a template for revolutionizing other artforms."/>

				<outline text="On &quot;earn&quot; and &quot;worth&quot;" created="Sun, 18 Jun 2000 05:07:06 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="In Dan Gillmor's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/008079.htm&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; yesterday he asks us to think about two important words, earn and worth. &quot;Worth is not about money, not in my book. It's about other qualities -- values, if you will -- that matter far more. Yet we invariably say so-and-so is worth $100 million, as if that had anything to do with this person's integrity or other characteristics.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I agree. I can tell you what a big problem it is, for people of our generation (Dan and I are approximately the same age). We were raised to believe that our worth was directly related to money. This probably has something to do with our parents' generation's experience in the Great Depression and World War II, and the economic boom that followed. "/>
					<outline text="Anyway, the big surprise to me, after making a large amount of money, which I worked for, and do feel that I earned, was that it did not increase other people's perception of my worth, nor my own. It took a few years of struggling with this to wake up to something. I had been putting off enjoying my life in a quest to attain a sense of worth, through money. So my advice to those who are sacrificing to attain financial wealth, find something else to illustrate the value in your life, if you feel you need to do that; the money is a detour, it won't get you what you want, imho."/>
					<outline text="On the other hand, there may be nothing you can do to create value in your life. This may sound depressing, but wait, just by being alive you have created a lot of value. Think about the miracle of the human body and the human mind. Think about the ages and the universe, and your relationship to these vastly incomprehensible things. You belong, like a leaf on a tree, to a great civilization, that has been working for many many milennia, just to create you. And like a link in a chain, you exist to create what comes next. Every one of us is necessary. Without you the universe wouldn't be the same. Now what do a few numbers on a disk in a bank mean in comparison to all that is you?"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews&quot;&gt;5/6/98&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When you make it, people don't want to hear what you have to say any more than they did before you made it. In fact, I think they want to hear you even less. Listening isn't based on how much money you have. Write that down and remember it. If you're waiting to be heard and think that having money will make a difference, trust me, it won't.&quot;"/>

A couple of years ago he was telling anyone who would listen that he was leaving his record company, going &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tr-i.com/subscribe.html&quot;&gt;straight&lt;/a&gt; to his fans through the Web. He was going to ask for the fans' &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tr-i.com/pitch.html&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;. What wasn't clear to me at the time was how little of the fan's money finds its way to the artists.

I didn't consider the possibility that there was more to the story, I must remember to probe deeper in the future, and challenge my own assumptions."/>

Then a few years later a boom, music videos, MTV. (Adam Curry has an EditThisPage.Com &lt;a href=&quot;http://adamcurry.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;, I keep wondering what role that site is going to play in all this.)"/>

Alex is working with Hollywood bigshots, Geffen, Spielberg, Katzenberg and Paul Allen. Alex's passion, he calls it Fanco, is what Love and Rundgren are talking about, from the flipside. Organize a Web service for artists (of all disciplines) and the fans. Let them run the Web. If they want to include stock quotes, that's fine, or if they want to share pictures and MP3 clips of the artists, that fine too. We'll provide the server space and the content management software. An integrated commerce back-end, so if you want to pay, that's really easy. Alex ran the servers at Netscape, and before that at Magellan, but he's also a movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; at UC-Berkeley.

					<outline text="The reporter isn't invited to the next press conference, his or her calls aren't returned. "/>
					<outline text="Moral of the story, to be competitive, to get the sound-bites, carry the party-line, without comment and no tough questions."/>
					<outline text="It's different in Europe, I hear. That's why the future of the Web may be in Europe and not in the US. I want the Web to cover stories from all angles, not just the company party-line. Lately this idea has been attracting a fair number of journalists. Is there something in the air? I don't know, I hope so."/>
					<outline text="Like Rundgren and Love, I have to create my own medium around these principles. I don't get invited to many press conferences. I self-censor sometimes, saving the insights for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/08/office2000&quot;&gt;written work&lt;/a&gt; and leaving others to ask the tough questions at the press conference (which never happens). In the US there's little or no support among the working press for controversy, which leads to the three-story phenomenon, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil and Java is the future, leaving all interesting questions unasked."/>

This had been troubling me ever since I started writing publicly on a regular basis in 1994. I'd flip-flop. Some years I'd say I'm a journalist (esp when I was writing at Wired) and some years I'd disclaim it. Now I don't. I am a journalist. And I am a vendor. Now some, at the NY Times, for example, would say this is impossible, but not only is it possible, but it's the way of the future."/>

I'm going to put some time this evening into editing it down, I'll make it much shorter, and leave out the motivations and appeals to Bill Gates's charity. I strongly believe there's a way to resolve the dispute, leaving Microsoft strong, and leaving the rest of the industry with a lot of new opportunity. "/>

It's not a bed-time story for kids. It'll freak them out, rightly so. Children need their parents, they're not ready to fly on their own, that's what it means to be a kid. It's actually a story for the kid inside every adult. A reminder that freedom is giving up. I really wrote it for Bill Gates, but I strongly doubt if he would get it, yet. Eventually we all get it, because as comfortable as the nest is, we have to give it up. That's one of the lessons of life. &quot;You can't take it with you&quot; or &quot;It's not like anyone gets out of this alive.&quot; Now it's time for some coffee!"/>

Jackson did not want to solve the problem. He wants Microsoft to do it. As long as Microsoft resists, the court has no choice but to impose a crude and ineffecient neutering of Microsoft.

In yesterday's top item, I said &quot;I don't care if it's right or wrong that Microsoft is broken up.&quot; Of course I actually &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; care, my point was slightly subtle (not really, if you read the rest of the stuff). "/>
					<outline text="I agree with the Judge, until Microsoft comes clean and owns up to what it did that was wrong and illegal, it is totally right that they should be broken up."/>
					<outline text="Microsoft has not behaved in a moral or legal manner with developers, competitors, and even the users, who had a right to a choice, which Microsoft's actions denied them. For them to invoke morals at this point is hypocritical and arrogant. It assumes massive stupidity outside of Microsoft. "/>

					<outline text="It's an interesting time to visit Microsoft. One thing is great about the company, I can say what I think on Scripting News, and I'm no less welcome. That's very unique in this business, where criticism is usually shunned. I don't do the egg shell walk very well."/>

He should have been fired on the spot for suggesting that Microsoft use its dominance of operating systems to win the war with Netscape. Of course he wasn't fired, because this is the business model at Microsoft. And it's illegal. And totally wrong. And unfair, and everything else that evokes my anger."/>
					<outline text="Another thing that gets me angry is arrogance and stupid public relations. I was at Microsoft the day they pulled the stunt on Judge Jackson. I met with Tod Nielsen and said that's it man, you crossed my line right there. Do you argue with the traffic cop too when you get pulled over? If so, you get what you deserve. We must respect &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; things. Like we live in a lawful society and we respect judges. I learned this at &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1996/03/01/juryduty&quot;&gt;jury duty&lt;/a&gt; in 1996.

Personally, I liked the recursive definition, RSS is Simple Syndication, but not a lot of people went along with that. "/>
					<outline text="Then I changed the copyright notice to use the IETF-inspired copyright that has worked well for XML-RPC. Basically it's a release of all proprietary interest by UserLand.

I encourage all other participants in the evolution of RSS to post similar disclaimers, but to be clear, I can't speak for anyone but UserLand."/>
					<outline text="The spec may be used to define supersets, so now it's possible for a fork to take place with a solid baseline behind it. A fork may be inevitable, because there are credible developers who want to take RSS into RDF and add namespaces and schema. UserLand does not want to go in this direction. "/>

				<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;rss&quot;&gt;RSS 0.91&lt;/a&gt;" created="Wed, 07 Jun 2000 05:06:02 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Now, let the flames begin. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="There's always a resistance to movement in any online community. It's been a long time since RSS has moved. Now I want to get prepared for movement. This is a total exercise in politics and group psychology. "/>
					<outline text="RSS 0.91 was a major traffic accident that turned out pretty well. Netscape did a private spec, just for their own web service. I had a couple of problems with it. First, we had been active in the area, and there had been no attempt to move compatibly. Second, they had a publishing agreement that was really offensive. We dealt with the first issue by competing. They quickly saw the advantage of working with us. Hat's off to Netscape. And we routed around their agreement by opening My.UserLand, which in no way attempts to control the content that flows through it."/>
					<outline text="After RSS 0.91, we breathed a sigh of relief that lasted almost a year. Glad that's over! In the meantime, repeated attempts to find anyone who cares about RSS at Netscape have turned up nothing. The people we worked with at Netscape left shortly after 0.91 was finalized. "/>
					<outline text="At WWW9 an impromptu BOF for RSS happened at Dale Dougherty's Web Publishing session. There were a fair number of people there who were actively developing in RSS. Some surprises, I didn't know that Sean McGrath was doing RSS stuff. I came out of the meeting with a resolve to get RSS moving again. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Resistence to movement" created="Wed, 07 Jun 2000 05:07:13 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="There's always a resistence to movement. It stirs people's feelings of powerlessness, at least that's how I parse it. Why isn't my pov being considered? is the constant question, sometimes not asked so nicely. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I've learned that it's necessary to strike a balance with this and the opposite complaint. &quot;Why aren't you addressing my needs?&quot; This is the question that comes from content providers. The answer is basically, if I move they're going to yell at me! (The other people, the ones who feel that their pov isn't being represented.) Then hopefully there's a point where the frustration over lack of movement overcomes the frustration of being powerless, and that's when movement can happen. I hope that we're now at that point. "/>
					<outline text="Another observation. Every time a mail list starts to guide the evolution of a spec, it seems to generate more &quot;Stop Now!&quot; energy than &quot;Let's go forward&quot; energy. The two recent exceptions in my experience are RSS and XML-RPC. My philosophy on XML-RPC, based on the frustration in previous projects, was &quot;I want to do it the way you want to do it.&quot; So when Don, Bob or Mohsen said &quot;I think we should call that element flebangolaleo,&quot; I didn't say a word, I just changed it in the spec. That lead to a collegiality that I've never seen in a cross-company development project before. It was truly magical, imho."/>
					<outline text="Now the question is, can we do that with RSS? Can we avoid arguments over small issues, and agree on some basic enhancements that give content developers enough room to do the kind of innovation they want to do? That's the first question on my mind. And I come to it not only as a developer of a CMS and an aggregator, but I am also a content developer. RSS has not grown with my needs. The same is true for Motley Fool, I assume (if they're still paying attention) and many other intelligent content people."/>
					<outline text="(BTW, a hat-tip to Zeldman, who finds the term &quot;content&quot; derogatory. Me too, I've even complained about it publicly. But in these conversations, we need a convenient short-hand to describe the wide variety of creative people who combine to create the stuff that people read on the Web. Actually the &quot;content person&quot; we have contact with is often an engineer who writes scripts to adjust the content to fit the format the aggregators can consume.)"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Can we keep it simple?" created="Wed, 07 Jun 2000 05:08:18 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="The second question, which to me isn't much less important, is Can we keep it simple? "/>
					<outline text="Today RSS *is* simple, largely because it only builds on XML 1.0, and does not use namespaces or schemas, and it isn't a dialect of RDF. There's a logical route forward for RSS that says it should adapt to include all these concepts, but in doing so it would become vastly more complex, and imho, at the content provider level, would buy us almost nothing for the added complexity."/>
					<outline text="Further, imho, the use of namespaces punts on the larger issue, what are the names of common elements for channels and news items? Using namespaces just pushes the problem into a corner. Instead we could agree that the names we use are going to be imperfect and misleading. But there will be standard element names for the info that the content providers want to publish, in addition to the elements that RSS already specifies. (A canonical example is Motley Fool's desire to include ticker symbols with each item, a totally legitimate desire, imho.)"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="A place to start" created="Wed, 07 Jun 2000 05:09:08 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="So over the weekend I started a review of RSS 0.91, and took notes, looked at the actual XML that people are publishing, studied the Netscape specification, and created my own version of the 0.91 spec. "/>
					<outline text="Up until this morning I wasn't sure if this document should be called 0.91 or 0.92. I was concerned that practice had deviated from the Netscape spec, esp in respecting the limits it imposes, which most developers (myself included) think are ridiculous and unweblike. But I found that most of the channels &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; respecting the limits, so I changed the title from 0.92 to 0.91. "/>
					<outline text="So all this is is a cleanup. All the Netscapeisms are removed. It's better organized and easier to follow. It links to helpful W3C specs and IETF RFCs that provide the foundation RSS builds on. It has a timeline that points to earlier specs, and to three important aggregators."/>
					<outline text="I do not want to call today's version of the spec final in any way. So for now it has a simple copyright notice, but I expect to finish my work on this by the end of the week, considering that it doesn't add anything to RSS, it should simply be a matter of reviewing it for editorial mistakes or omissions, there is no room to debate new features, because the spec doesn't attempt to add any."/>
					<outline text="So with all those caveats and preambles, here's my version of the RSS 0.91 specification."/>

				<outline text="Open Source" created="Wed, 07 Jun 2000 05:13:58 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Open Source is on the mind today. Talking with Edd Dumbill over the weekend, about lots of things, including the evolution of RSS, and the O'Reilly Open Source Convention, which was briefly a topic on Scripting News on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/06/04&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. "/>
					<outline text="I said something to Edd that I have not yet said on Scripting News, and if Tim had been willing to engage in a conversation, he might have said it himself. (To be clear, what follows is Dave in Tim's body.)"/>
					<outline text="&quot;Dave, get a clue. When we started the open source marketing push, followed by the convention, there was no such thing as the open source community. None of the developers or users of any of the scripting systems (Perl, Python, Tcl) talked to each other. Same with the developers of Apache, Sendmail, and MySQL. Now I understand your complaint that there are silly barriers that keep you from working with people in the open source world, and I wish there was something I could do about it, but look at all the good we've done. Now at least once a year they all meet in one building. This has lead to some wonderful cross-pollination, for example the recent decision by Zope to embrace Perl. These communities tend to build really large walls around themselves and tend to see the whole world as being inside those walls. We make progress as fast as we can.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Now, back in my own body. &quot;Tim, thanks for pointing that out.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Edd also made a point that I've heard echoed by others at O'Reilly. Not all of the people in the open source world have embraced the Web. There are so many Venn Diagrams you can draw. Open source or not is just one of the diagrams, one set of walls that define communities. Another is &quot;Are you a Web person or not?&quot; I remember the look on Tim's face at the Web Apps session at Esther's. He was delighted. He asked &quot;Why isn't the whole show like this?&quot; An insightful question. Now back at you Tim, why isn't that point of view represented at the Open Source Convention?"/>
					<outline text="I guess the bottom line for me is this. Are running a conference to make money and achieve a modest level of cooperation within the open source community, or are you running a Web conference, to draw more people together, to provide a way for people in ever more disparate worlds to get to know each other and work productively? "/>
					<outline text="At the end of the Web Apps &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/03/12/whatIsAWebApplication&quot;&gt;session&lt;/a&gt; at Esther's, Tim complimented me on the job I did. He asked if I was going to do this again. I said YES! He asked if I would do it with O'Reilly or on my own. I said at O'Reilly. Well they seem to have forgotten that, so we must do our own conference, and of course we will welcome people from the open source world. It's the old route-around thing that the Internet does so well. Be inclusive. Exclusivity is inevitable, but when it's discovered, treat it as a bug, and fix it, cheerfully. Murphy's Law. Not a big deal. &lt;i&gt;&quot;It's even worse than it appears.&quot; &lt;/i&gt; &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

					<outline text="Bill answered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/softballQuestionForBill.gif&quot;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; but related question."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/daveWascha.gif&quot;&gt;Dave Wascha&lt;/a&gt; is talking about how the whole thing works. I asked another question. &quot;Is this stuff just for Microsoft developers, or can your XML be used to configure a server running on Linux or Mac OS?&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I was thinking that it's a really good idea to use a visual outliner like Visio to design business processes (whatever that means) but I'd like to have the choice of running my server on another operating system. I like Windows 2000, we use it on most of our servers. But someday some software may appear that only runs on Linux and I want to be sure that we can use it to run our Web applications. Also, I'd like to do the business logic routing in Frontier. I already have a license (grin) and it runs 24-by-7 with no bluescreens. Again, will your XML format be open and documented, or is it a Microsoft thing?"/>
					<outline text="In all seriousness, this is the are-you-open question. Of course we're happy to build plug-ins, esp if they're willing to underwrite the development (I like the $2 billion part) but we can't support it as a standard unless we can compete with them for the central app that does the orchestrating. We have a robust server system that is up to the job. Does Microsoft want competition here?"/>
					<outline text="And we'd also like to compete with the design tool. Our outliner isn't as pretty as Visio (I couldn't find any screen shots of Visio on the Microsoft site, for such a visual product that's a pretty big oversight) but it is quite functional and fully wired into the Web in ways that overload my mind with their power. So basically we'd like to compete at both ends, in the design tool and in the server that runs the processes. And of course if we can compete so can the tools vendors for other operating systems, such as RealBasic and AppleScript on the Mac, and Perl, Python, Tcl, etc on Unix."/>

Tim got hung up over Dickinson's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/patents/2000/05/24/PizzoFiles2.html?page=2&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/a&gt; about the Xerox Star and its relation to the Mac and Windows. "/>
					<outline text="The Star is an interesting example, but it has nothing to do with the kinds of patents the USPTO is issuing now. The Star was truly a breakthrough produced by a single identifiable entity. Or was it? Wasn't the Star was a synthesis of ideas developed &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt; Xerox? Remember Doug Engelbart? He did the first mouse and windowing system (and outliner). He worked for SRI, not Xerox. "/>
					<outline text="Further, the Star was developed in the old communication environment, whiteboards, telephones and F2F meetings. The Star was an important step in synthesizing a global interconnected community of thinkers and developers, that easily crosses organizational boundaries. (Also known as The Internet.)"/>
					<outline text="The development environment of 2000 is &lt;i&gt;vastly different&lt;/i&gt; from the one of the 1970s. The gestation period for new breakthroughs is measured sometimes in days. Ideas are in the air, who created it first? It's usually impossible to tell. For us, who are developing in this environment, we share so frequently, without any thought. The Dickinson approach spells the end for this process. Speaking for Tim, if I may, we don't want it to end."/>
