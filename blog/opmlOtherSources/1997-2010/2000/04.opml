					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/library/financial/columns/043000col-watch.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Employees, whose options from previous years are now under water, become restless.

				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;A SOAP Scanner?&lt;/b&gt;" type="outline">
					<outline text="Talking with Bob Bierman on the phone this morning, I say I want a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hp.com/sbso/products/printing/pcscanners.html&quot;&gt;scanner&lt;/a&gt;, I've been asking him to get me one for over a year, but every time we talk we hit the same problem. Neither of us think that I would be willing to put up with the amount of work needed to get my scans onto the Web."/>
					<outline text="I asked if anyone had developed an HTTP-based scanner as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; in Sept 1997. &quot;Put a piece of paper into the scanner. Press a button on the machine to scan the paper. Open up my web browser on my desktop machine. Open the home page of the scanner. A list of GIFs appears, in reverse chronologic order. Click on the top one. A GIF appears in my web browser. Do a save-as, or drag-drop to get it into Photoshop.&quot;"/>

					<outline text="Bob says that you still can't get such a scanner. I find that amazing. He said we might be able to do something like that with Frontier, but what communication protocols do the scanners use?"/>

At the same time, Napster also encourages users to contribute back to the richness of this resource by making their own music collection available as a small part of the whole. So Napster is also an example of a two-way user interface to the Internet. &quot;"/>
					<outline text="An interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$16781&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;, how would a separate Internet Explorer company make money?

				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;The move went well&lt;/b&gt;" type="outline">
					<outline text="Good morning, and welcome to UserLand's new land of many servers running at Exodus. The move went smoothly. We aimed for the gutters and Murphy was kind. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;&quot;I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="For some reason a hard disk in Seattle went out during the move. Totally died. A completely random event? Oh sure. If you believe that I have a nice bridge in Brooklyn I'd like you to consider buying. Murphy works in strange ways."/>
					<outline text="There was a configuration error on our Mail Transfer Agent (easily fixed). "/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/2000/04/29&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; was the first to update his ETP site. Makes sense. Now keep an eye out for breakage. How does the new LAN perform? We can't blame it on Conxion anymore. Good deal."/>
					<outline text="Down the street at Qube Quorner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.userland.com/qube/2000/04/30&quot;&gt;Luke Tymowski likes&lt;/a&gt; the new Exodus performance of his site. &quot;The static version of this site used to take 5 seconds to render, the dynamic version 15 seconds. Now the static version takes 1 second, the dynamic version 2 seconds.&quot; (Of course the rendering takes the same amount of time, on the server side, but the Internet gets in the middle of that. I guess Luke is saying that his path to Exodus is faster than his path to Conxion.)"/>
					<outline text="Another change. After &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$611&quot;&gt;moving all the apps&lt;/a&gt; off the old Nirvana machine, I had to quickly come up with another name for the server last night in the middle of the move. I decided to call the machine &quot;mainResponder&quot;. Nirvana was the codename for &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$616&quot;&gt;mainResponder&lt;/a&gt;. It was 1.0 a long time ago. So as we retired the Nirvana name (it now points to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nirvana.userland.com/&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; of static files on our Linux server to keep breakage to a minimum), my new experimental machine keeps the family name going. You'd have to be a Frontier geek to appreciate this, perhaps."/>
					<outline text="One caveat, until I get DSL installed at my home-office, I will still be using Conxion's T1 line to connect to the Internet. So if there's an outage, it will knock me and only me off the net. "/>
					<outline text="One final note, I guess I am pretty confident in my team. While I was waiting for the move to finish I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 5AM. Oh geez. Did they do a great job? Yes they did! I have the best team in the world. What's our secret? Good engineering and lots of prayer."/>

					<outline text="NY Times: &lt;a href=&quot;http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/04/biztech/articles/29react.html&quot;&gt;Breakup of a Giant Is Seen Reigniting Competition in the Software Business&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;There is all kinds of gobbledygook coming out of the Justice Department,&quot; said Randy Komisar, &quot;They are hoping that by creating an applications company as aggressive as the OS company, the new company will do things like make bets on Palm and Linux. That way they will crack open the operating system market.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="First, Microsoft's apps are &lt;a href=&quot;http://macworld.zdnet.com/2000/07/reviews/explorer.html&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macintouch.com/o2001.html&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; on Mac OS, which is the only other large-installed-base desktop system, after Windows. So that part of the argument is weird, Office has already been ported. Would it make any sense to port Office to Palm? Hmmm. The screen is much smaller and there's no keyboard. That makes a pretty big difference. Microsoft has been trying to create a suite of palmtop apps for quite sometime, without much success. "/>
					<outline text="Then, why would I want Microsoft's apps on Linux? I totally see Linux is a server OS. Long way to go before it's ready for people who use Office. What does this proposal do to help Linux get more apps that aren't from Microsoft? Further, from what I know of MS (I've been visiting them for almost 20 years), if there were a market for the Office apps on Linux, they would be there. "/>
					<outline text="Where are the software historians? Did you see how they undermined MS-DOS by moving to the Mac in the 1980s? They taught the rest of the industry to stop tying one product to another. Lotus refused to support Windows in the early days, they didn't want to help Microsoft, and learned the lesson that Microsoft taught so well. Stop believing your own bullshit. Same with IBM and the tie-in between PS/2 and OS/2. "/>
					<outline text="Microsoft was unique in that they played all the angles. They are the original jump out of the plane with no parachute people, as far as I'm concerned. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Excise the browser, embrace WINE&lt;/b&gt;" type="outline">
					<outline text="Again, imho, the best remedy is to split out the browser, and only that, into a separate company. Windows must forever ship without an HTML browser. A one-click install screen, baked into Windows, with a set of choices approved by a panel of independent Web developers. The first choice in the list could not be the former Microsoft HTML browser, for three years. No more than ten choices would ever be offered."/>
					<outline text="That would fix any problems caused by the untimely demise of Netscape, which any reasonable and impartial person would have to admit was at least &lt;i&gt;somewhat&lt;/i&gt; caused by mismanagement at Netscape. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Here's another thing we could ask Microsoft for. Make WINE really work. Make it easy for all Windows apps migrate to Linux, not just Microsoft's. It totally makes sense. Open the floodgates Bill. Show them how easy it is to turn the software industry upside down, without wrecking your company.&lt;/i&gt;"/>

					<outline text="I spoke this afternoon with Bill Chubb, VP Broadband Services at PacBell. The escalation through Davos worked. (Thanks Lance!) He did something that Conxion has failed to do so far, he apologized. Even though we are not his direct customer. What a pleasure to have a real business person enter the loop who understands the value of the C word. "/>
					<outline text="Even though tomorrow is the last day that we depend on PacBell-Conxion for mission-critical services, I'm still helping route Chubb into Conxion's service people so that they can upgrade the service for Conxion's remaining 40 customers who use PacBell to link to the Internet. Ask not what the Internet can do for &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/asknot.gif&quot;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;. But I'll tell you what Conxion can do for me. Apologize for the unbelievably rough treatment and offer us a credit for all the money we're wasting doing this conversion and for the lost business during March and April. And then thank us for continuing to help."/>

As far as I know, they're going alone at this level.  This may create an opportunity for the rest of the industry to agree on a way of integrating tools with the web that is multi-vendor on both the workstation and the server side. I see this is as an opportunity on the scale of the opportunity for hardware vendors in the late 80s when IBM went their own way with the PS/2 and OS/2. Microsoft certainly has the option of embracing the interface we've put out. There's a multi-step leapfrog thing going on here. I only have my own point of view. Lots of details missing in that view.

He says &quot;outliners aren't the most intuitive writing interface, and UserLand's implementation feels a little odd compared to the text editors I'm used to. Still, the ability to remain in the editor while saving updates back to the site is damn useful, and the ability to structure text is ultimately worth while.&quot; " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Angus, this points out the need for competition. We make outliners at UserLand. It's a very specific kind of writing tool, it's perfect for template design, presentations and scripting. The ability to edit in sections and easily move the sections around is key for me as a weblog writer. But we know it's not a mainstream writing style, and that a great simple wizzy HTML editor will be incredibly valuable here.

				<outline text="What will this do to increase competitiveness in web browser software? Another question. If Microsoft didn't own Word, would their web browser be a better text editor by now? This came up in our discussion with Lance yesterday (see below). Word has a limited ability to save to the Web. What if there were a company that only did web browsers? What if that company had retained its sanity and focused on giving users and developers what they wanted? The race started six years ago. Where would we be now? Imho, that's the question the attorneys should be asking. How can we get this very vital software category moving again?" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Yesterday I got a phone call from Dan Gillmor about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$598&quot;&gt;essaylet&lt;/a&gt; I wrote. The call came in the middle of the SOAP announcement, which I knew was coming, but I didn't know when. Dan was concerned that people would read the piece and conclude that he wrote about Conxion because we are friends and because I asked him to. Only Dan can say why he wrote about it, I can't read his mind, but I never in a million years thought he would do it because there's a friendship. " type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Later I thought that Dan's definition of integrity as it relates to friendship is so vague to me, and might not be compatible with the culture of the Web, where reciprocal links are a way of life. If I point to someone repeatedly, I expect attention, in the form of links. If the links don't come, I tend not to link. Kind of like peering deals in the ISP world? I see a balance between Dan's site and mine, in fact, in this space, my site is bigger, there's more content, and more hits. In my value system, a pointer from me is worth more than a pointer from Dan. However, there's extra ooomph from a Dan-pointer, because some people place more value on it. Steve Ballmer, a super-busy guy, made time to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/docs/dg042700.htm&quot;&gt;dinner with Dan&lt;/a&gt;. Conxion has an idea that the Merc is important. The Merc carries clout that my web writing doesn't. Where this comes from is somewhere in Dan's mind. He has a clue that I don't.

A split of Microsoft that leaves one company owning network services and the browser is a fox in a henhouse, makes no sense. Who cares about competition in operating systems. No one will bother. The action is on the Internet. I still say, if there's to be a split, it should just remove the browser from MS, and leave everything else as-is. The OS company would be precluded from making a browser. It would have a certain amount of time (1 year?) to decouple the browser from the OS, and as a proof of concept they would have to integrate Mozilla and ship it with the OS. End of problem. And a blueprint for dealing with any further competitive problems." type="outline"/>

					<outline text="An outage is an incredible opportunity for reflection. I had planned twenty small tasks that couldn't be done while the net was down, at first I was grouchy, then I went for a walk, and came back energized. The net was still down. I went for another walk. That's unusual for me, very, at least when I'm in California. When I'm traveling I walk all the time."/>
					<outline text="Here's what I realized, I don't like reflection. I don't like hearing how my thoughts reflect on others. A says something to B. I don't really want to hear what B heard. Now once I realize I don't want something, I choose to follow the advice of an old girlfriend who used to say &quot;Then that's what we'll do!&quot; Her voice is still very with me.

If you already have a UserLand.Com cookie, that email address will be entered for you, but if you prefer to have it sent to a different address you can change it. Click on Submit. We send an email to that address. The email contains a single button that confirms that you want to subscribe. So you can't subscribe someone else.

					<outline text="Does Amazon consider this infringement? I'd love to hear from them. If they do, we'll probably back down and make it more complicated. You will get a chance to tell Amazon what you think about that, if it should happen. And we will not file a patent on this, so if you're a developer and want to use this process, go ahead. But a pointer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/24&quot;&gt;permanent archive&lt;/a&gt; for this page would be nice. Thank you for the flow."/>
					<outline text="Scripting News is not just about scripting. It's also about patents vs freedom. My goal is not only to make the best software I possibly can, but also to help users see the value of freedom. We'd all like email subscriptions to work better. It's clear how they can. I don't mind if others use my ideas, in fact I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; them to. I also want to learn if Amazon and others will stand in the way. To me, the users are the real issue. So far they haven't felt the impact of patent mania. The sooner they do, imho, the better. That's one of the reasons I wanted to do this feature, this way. Freedom of expression.

Same old open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/misc/snImages/ericRaymondHubris.gif&quot;&gt;bluster&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of theories, few facts to back them up.

But where's the Lotus 1-2-3? Apache is boring! Where's the revolution for writers and thinkers? Geez. Look a little closer Brian, it doesn't have &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; to do with the economic system. If we worked with each other great things would happen.

				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Here's an essay&lt;/b&gt;" type="outline">
					<outline text="I realize what I'm doing now is concentrating all my writing into one flow. I'm writing the docs for new features on the home page. No hops. I'm also concentrating the flow of all emails into this page. And at the same time I'm inviting people to speak here, but doing it awkwardly and ineffectively. Think of it this way, that's all that was happening with Conxion. I'm sure that if they had the time (they don't) to get to know the community here, they would have something to say to them, like use our service! Their ads are trying to reach the people we already reach. But their ads are fearful things. &quot;You will lose, you will be punished,&quot; etc. Here, they could say, &quot;Look at all we do to help Dave, we'd like to do that for you too.&quot; (Of course they must stop reselling PacBell's miserable T1 service, I'd support that fully.) "/>
					<outline text="Anyway going back before Conxion, I tried to get VA Linux to come talk with us. That failed. Who else? I'm sure I'll think of others. Doc is so right, the Web is about conversation. If Brian Behlendorf, who is surely a very busy man with his own community, would only say hello in a friendly way! Such incredible things could happen. Like we could make all our software work together, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/03/02/theTwowayweb&quot;&gt;plug and play&lt;/a&gt;."/>
					<outline text="Now I could never write this in DaveNet. It would make no sense. It barely makes sense here. There's kind of a loose hub. We link to a churning pot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;weblogs&lt;/a&gt;, but they are independent of us. We host thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;free sites&lt;/a&gt;, mostly run by professionals, people who know a lot and want to share it. There's also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/&quot;&gt;vast library&lt;/a&gt; of syndicated XML content which cares not whether you use bloated open source software or bloated commercial-ware to read it. It just doesn't care. Have fun. And then there's &quot;Pike&quot;, the biggest juiciest invitation to Apache ever. Make Apache work with Pike and there's a revolution. Why? Open interfaces between writing tools and servers. Embrace the desktop, don't wait for it to show up on Linux. It's already there on Mac and Windows. Microsoft gets this. I doubt if &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; in ApacheLand does. (I feel like Paul Revere.)"/>
					<outline text="Now how can I seduce a really bright guy like Brian to spend some time learning what we do, and explain it in a context that makes sense to Linux developers, open source or whatever? That's what I gotta figure out. It doesn't have to be Brian. Help me figure this out."/>
					<outline text="Final note. I'm sure some people don't like the evolving format of Scripting News, but I really do. My whole way of writing for the web is shifting. And I really owe it all to Pike. What a trip it's been. The goal has been to get a decent writing tool that could connect directly to the Web, cutting the number of steps to revise to a minimum. I edit Scripting News just like you would edit a text document on a local hard drive. But the server is out there, not right here, and I don't have to use HTML, but I can. If you write for the Internet, you're going to be doing it this way. The only question is will it be only with Microsoft's software or with software from others as well? Right now, as far as I know, only UserLand and Microsoft are working in this area. Think about that."/>

I like it because it gives me leverage on my intelligence. I can't do everything, and I know it.

				<outline text="10:55AM: I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$581&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; from Steve Martin at Conxion. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/04/18&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If Conxion is getting rid of a customer because of the customer's statements, that's not smart business for Conxion in the long run, even though it's legal.&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="More comments. First, we not only make the software that runs Dan's site, we also host it. So an ISP outage like the one with Conxion could have knocked Dan off the air too. Second, Conxion has never given us a reason for the termination. We've heard about their statements from reporters, which varies widely depending on who they're talking to and when, but their April 12 letter doesn't provide a reason, and there has been no response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$577&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; I sent or the postings here. Third, if it is, as they said to Dan, an issue of economics, why the abruptness? Why not a grace period for a long-term customer who has to make a forced transition? " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Dan also says: &quot;I'm working on a column discussing the power of ISPs relative to their customers.&quot; I suggest that Conxion empower someone to work out an amicable exit here, so we can say that Conxion, in the end, did the right thing. " type="outline"/>

I agree! Friends don't run away from disconnects, they have the courage to go into them, and learn, and if it's done well, the friendship is stronger for it. Thank you Dan, I am very glad to be working with you, web person to web person. I care that you work for the SJ Merc, only sofar as some people, like Conxion, take you more seriously than they take me.

I'm writing this from China, however, which does give one a perspective on Web censorship! (And I think it's China's weird firewalls that force me to go through MSN, rather than the Forum server to send out email.) Despite the problems here, there are extraordinary Internet entrepreneurs that I've met in the last two days. Really encouraging. The UK situation will, I hope, be resolved by the government giving ISP common carrier status. You can't sue the phone company if someone slanders you on the telephone.&quot; This is good news.

Many print pubs stood with us in support of free speech on the Internet. Conspicuously missing was the NY Times, previously thought to be a bastion of free speech, everywhere. Was it a disconnect? Is it a disconnect now? Where do each of us stand on freedom of the press on the Web? Seriously, if you stay silent now, and benefit from our generosity, will you have any cause to complain if we get shut down at the *next* ISP? If you run a site elsewhere, how does your ISP treat you if you choose to write about them? Do they think they're entitled to a benefit beyond the fee? (Our ISP clearly did.) If you are playing footsy with your ISP, how do you disclose this? Would it piss them off if you put a disclaimer on your site: &quot;We can't criticize the following people and companies because they could shut us down if they don't like what we say.&quot; You can't have a free press in this environment." type="outline"/>

When they interfered with our ability to do our work, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://206.204.24.28/trackPacBell/trackPacBellWebsite/&quot;&gt;quantified&lt;/a&gt; it. When I criticized them (mildly, compared to how I felt) for stepping over the line challenging our First Amendment rights, they shut us down. Unbelievable. " type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Here's the best part, instead of an apology and a credit for all the outages: &quot;Our records show that you have currently paid for Services through April 30, 2000.

In the print world, it's not uncommon for a columnist in a newspaper to criticize the newspaper he or she works for, or to criticize companies that advertise with the newspaper. In the e-commerce world this is going to be even more important. Sweeping the truth under the rug is not a good way to gain trust. Our readers knew that we were having technical problems.

I did use a lot of restraint. An ISP has a lot of power, esp when the outages persist. How do they use the power? Do they interfere with their customers' relationships with their customers? We're finding out now that this ISP uses their power to shut down critics. This is a Cluetrain thing. If I were them, I'd welcome criticism. This is how you get the bugs out.

It's true that Steve and Diane did pull out all the stops to help us. We did thank them for their help, publicly. It's really awful to have this used against us. Further, our deal with Conxion, from the start, was for a full T1, not for 128K. So Antonio is actually spinning a negative against his company against us. Further, the really hard part to swallow is the lecture on what the First Amendment does and does not allow. He is not a lawyer, and his opinion on this subject is misinformed and irrelevant. You will see my response to him on the April 5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/05&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, which on review, is quite measured.

Sometimes you receive something via email that belongs on your website. Sounds complex perhaps, but consider this. We have a new tool in our kit. An easy to use outliner.

Many of the stories are things people did to their siblings that they feel guilty about. I have such a story. When I was a kid I played baseball. I joined a Little League team and they had a raffle. We were supposed to go door-to-door selling them so the team could get new uniforms, or something like that. The grand prize was a new car. I sold a ticket to my little brother, who often did exactly what I asked him to do. That was the only ticket I sold. But I never turned the stub in. So my poor cute sweet &lt;i&gt;trusting&lt;/i&gt; little brother never had a chance to win. To this day I feel horrible pangs of guilt associated with this. I've apologized to him, and he told me not to worry about it, but I still feel terrible. Maybe now that I've told the story publicly the guilt will dissipate.

				<outline text="BTW, a correction to the title of the Times article. It's not computers that have freedom of speech, it's people who write computer software. This is a respect issue that goes to the beginning of folklore about computers. It was thought, at one time, that computers could gain consciousness, and perhaps have rights and vote and otherwise be human. In fact, it takes conscious beings, programmers, to make computers do anything useful. It's the &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; who create software whose rights are in question. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/lessig.html&quot;&gt;Professor Lessig&lt;/a&gt; about this in Phoenix, if First Amendment issues could apply to clearing up the patent mess, now maybe it's clear that it can. At some point the USPTO is going to cross over into First Amendment space. Has that already happened? I think it has." type="outline"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/05/07/Programmers&quot;&gt;5/7/97&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When a programmer catches fire it's because he or she groks the system, its underlying truth has been revealed. I've seen this happen many times, a programmer languishes for months, chipping at the edges of a problem. Then all of a sudden, a breakthrough happens, the pieces start fitting together. A few months later the software works, and you go forward.&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="If you're a writer, journalist or designer, think about the paragraph above. How does that describe the synthesis of your work? Now imagine if you didn't have the First Amendment. You'd have to revise your work to remove any idea that anyone had ever expressed before. Lawyers would be the only ones who could write. This is my concern about programming. If patents are allowed to control free expression of ideas in software, the best software designers will be shut down." type="outline"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.herring.com/cod/2000/0405.html&quot;&gt;Rafe Needleman&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I spent years managing product reviews, and I have a strong interest in the new consumer review services. I do confess that my inner editor instinctively mistrusts these sites -- it wonders if end-users can review products as well as experienced writers. But I know that the community of consumers is, in sum, much smarter than any 'professional' reviewer could ever be. In my opinion, community review is one of the most important trends in online content.&quot;" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Exactly. That's why we call our company UserLand. It's built on the assumption that users know what a product really does and have a clear idea how it can be improved. Professional reviewers have to be superficial, the editorial process tends to remove the most valuable ideas, for a variety of reasons, some having to do with economics, or emotional (not wanting to offend the vendor, see yesterday's exchange with Conxion), but mostly about dumbing-down the writing to appeal to the broadest number of people, and repeating soothing Dilbertesque mantras (mostly untrue) over and over. (E.g. Java is the future, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil, etc.)" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="This should now explain the confusion we had with Chris DiBona, in the email exchange a couple of weeks ago. We weren't asking for review units, we were offering to build a community around the future of his server products, with users who really care about the products, and who are proven to be smart and who express themselves well. We should do it anyway. " type="outline"/>

Under his license, 'Anybody who has no patents is free to use my ideas,' he says. 'Anybody who has patents and licenses them on these terms, or better, can also use them free of charge. Otherwise, come talk to me about a license' -- and bring a checkbook.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Excellent, it would make it fun to screw the greedy patent-mongers (and profitable).&lt;/i&gt; " type="outline"/>

To the extent that DaveNet email readers are willing to make a trip to the Web, that's the extent to which I'm willing to share what I learn. Read in an email context I come off as a highly disconnected voice. They don't understand what I'm saying. How could they? It doesn't make sense in email.

The integrity issues are remarkably parallel, the concerns that guide decisions on control of data, seem related to editorial ethics.
