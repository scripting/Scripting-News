    "text": "Something you hear from Democratic politicians and MSNBC hosts. \"We know why Musk is cutting so much, it's to fund a huge tax cut for billionaires.\" They don't actually know that and I doubt it's true. Show me another example where Musk did anything to benefit anyone but himself? Why should he share the loot he's grabbing with other rich folk? What did they do to help? Nah I think it's all for him, with a taste going to the Trump and Putin families. He's going to use his new power to buy something else. The question is what? What else could he want? I imagine he wants <i>all the money</i> in the world not just the most. ",
