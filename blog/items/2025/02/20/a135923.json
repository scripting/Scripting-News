And here's the <a href=\"https://skywrt.com/scripting.com/006\">version</a> of the thread without being broken up into 300-character chunks (you can get it by clicking in the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/20/clickHereToReadFullThread.png\">metadata box</a> below the text of the post). I don't like it. The software is as good as it can be, given the extreme limits of the twitter-like environment. I went all the way with this, but I'm not sure I'm going to release it. But I'm going to keep using it, and maybe I'll think of something that makes it fun or worthwhile, or maybe I'll just chalk it up to another learning experience. ",
