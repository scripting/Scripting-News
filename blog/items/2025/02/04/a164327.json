    "text": "I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment on Bluesky and found that they have a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22\">Suggested User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of telling the story that's really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter, people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We're living with their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them has run its course, don't you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika stickers on Teslas. That's nice. The reason you can get away with that is that you're attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course <i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed, so quickly.",
