    "text": "People give <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg\">Matt Mullenweg</a> a lot of grief, but do they realize how hopeless the open web would be if he and his friends hadnâ€™t kept it going for 20+ years. I wrote the other day that I feel like a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html#a153833\">time traveler</a>, discovering WordPress 20 years after I left UserLand. I care that it's open source, but I care much more that it's open web esp after we've been so thoroughly dominated by feature-limited silos such as Twitter, Facebook and yes -- even Mastodon and Bluesky. Even if there's a theoretical way to do it, practically speaking we have to wait for their developers to implement the features we want. Open source doesn't help there, but open web does. Matt puts the emphasis on the open source part, that's why it wasn't until very recently that I realized that <i>open web</i> is more important, to me at least. ",
