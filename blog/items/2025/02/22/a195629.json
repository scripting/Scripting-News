    "text": "\"WordLand\" opened yesterday for everyone to use. There was a deal-stopping bug reported last night, <a href=\"https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/02/21/bookmarks-opml-not-found-ooops/\">fixed</a> provisionally, then for real this morning. Prevented new users from getting started. Really embarassing. If you have trouble, please report. There's a link for Support in the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/22/support.png\">main menu</a>.  WordLand is designed to be the kind of editor you use in a social app like Bluesky or Mastodon, but with most of the features of \"textcasting\". ",
