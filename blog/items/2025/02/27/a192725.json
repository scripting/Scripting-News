    "text": "Like many other people I love <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Severance\">Severance</a>, esp this season, and esp the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+season+2+episode+6\">most recent episode</a>. My favorite scene in the last episode <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/severance-season-2-episode-6-why-helena-followed-mark-to-restaurant/\">took place</a> at a Chinese restaurant. Anyway, I was just listening to the latest episode of the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s2e6-attila-with-christopher-walken-and-sarah-bock/id1788381175?i=1000694662565\">Severance podcast</a>, about this episode, which you should definitely listen to if you like me love the show. They have an interview with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Walken\">Christopher Walken</a> who plays <a href=\"https://severance-tv.fandom.com/wiki/Burt_Goodman\">Burt</a>. Amazing stuff. But even more amazing is that I learned in the podcast that the restaurant mentioned earlier is actually a famous <a href=\"https://www.engsrestaurant.com/\">Kingston restaurant</a> that just <a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/hudsonvalley/food/article/engs-chinese-restaurant-kingston-opens-dining-room-20058303.php\">re-opened</a> after a long hiatus, so I've not yet had a chance to eat there, but I want to, <a href=\"https://www.engsrestaurant.com/\">Eng's</a>. This, after learning that <a href=\"https://ny.eater.com/2025/1/27/24350496/severance-pips-phoenicia-diner-catskills\">the diner</a> that's in two scenes, one in each season, is the <a href=\"https://www.phoeniciadiner.com/\">Phoenicia Diner</a>, one of my favorite local eating places.
