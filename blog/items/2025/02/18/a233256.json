I have the time, and Bluesky is having moment after moment and these days I'm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, though I do check Twitter, Threads and Mastodon a few times a day, but usually there's nothing for me in those places. Anyway I'll be pointing to this post <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3liihaddhsf2g\">from</a> some of my experiments, so maybe nothing more interesting than this will appear here.
