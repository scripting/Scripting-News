    "text": "I possibly was a bit hasty in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/02/04.html#a204729\">declaring the coup over</a> yesterday. I'm sure there will be new restraining orders from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying those, so there's some hope when that happens he'll order Musk to stop, and then we'll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup reality works. The shock of Trump's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo\">plan for Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most \"loyal\" Repubs in Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are installed in their personal operating systems, somewhere in there is the remnant of the ideals of the Constitution. So I might have missed the mark, I hope I did. Meanwhile I wonder if Musk's wonderboys have managed to penetrate the military, and if they're planning on giving them orders about how to restrain the anti-Musk protests that are starting to break out around the country. Oh mama we live in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times\">interesting times</a>. ",
