I was at the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/west14thstreet/\">Apple Store on 14th St</a> in NYC to pick up a new phone I had pre-ordered, lined up with some much younger folks who asked if I knew what was new on the phone. I said I wasn’t sure, so I asked if they knew. They all agreed the coolest thing was called “pod casting.” They said it slowly to be sure I could understand. They said it was great, it was like radio, but you could get it from the web, and there was always lots of new stuff. \"What will they think of next,\" said the old man, impressed, nodding with respect.
