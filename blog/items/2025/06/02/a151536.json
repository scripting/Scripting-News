    "text": "I asked ChatGPT if I moved to NYC in 2009 or 2010. It answered in an instant. \"You moved to NYC in 2010.\" I asked how it knew. It <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/02/whenIMovedToNYC.png\">used my blog</a> as the source. We have <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/683da1e2-33d0-8012-a86c-d5310ac4538e\">arrived</a> in the future. This is exactly the kind of query I've been begging Google to support for decades. They could have figured out where my blog is, or let me tell it where it is. Famously they once asked if I had misspelled my mother's last name in a query. How freaking clueless can you get. \n",
