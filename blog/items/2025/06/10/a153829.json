I told the story of how I chose the Grateful Dead's music to get the initial implementation going, on both the sending and receiving side. I used their music, since it so totally fit in with the philosophy, ie come as you are, we're all just people. And the song I chose was a good one too, the <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22US%20Blues%22\">US Blues</a>. \"I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am. I've been hiding out. In a rock and roll band.\" Using great art to prototype this connection makes total sense. It says we carry forward our art where ever we go, no matter where it takes us, a great work of music or art is always a good thing to share. ",
