    "text": "Jeremy Herve of Automattic <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jeremy@herve.bzh/114618613561154574\">responded</a> to yesterday's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/06/02/131444.html\">suggestion</a> about when to set the og:image metadata in a page. His response is persuasive, but there may be a way to work around it. And a hat-tip to Jeremy, he's helped us so many times getting \"WordLand\" ready to market. When you're fitting a product to another <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/10/21/155259.html\">product</a> as a platform, it's so important to get help from the vendor, and usually you don't get much of that. Thanks! :smile:",
