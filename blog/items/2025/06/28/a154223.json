    "text": "The latest David Frum podcast is about <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-show-tina-brown-iran-nuclear-program/683320/\">crazy tech billionaires</a>. Once again he talks about who he's willing to listen to. He's really smart, thinks about things, and speaks brilliantly, but cultivates his ignorance and seems somewhat proud of it. In contrast, I listened to Jon Stewart's weekly podcast <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/iran-beyond-the-headlines-with-maziar-bahari/id1583132133?i=1000714626073\">yesterday</a> and it was as usual outstanding. Like Frum he thinks and speaks brilliantly, with the addition of being hilarious at times. In this episode he talks to an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maziar_Bahari\">Iranian friend</a>, a new perspective we don't hear often, but fits in with what I had <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=iran\">understood</a> about Iran. It's a highly educated country, a good standard of living and are mired with a repressive government and no options for regime change. When you hear that talked about on other podcasts and cable news shows, remember -- it's impossible to change regimes unless the country has prepared for that. There is no regime-in-waiting in Iran, hasn't been one since the 1979 revolution. This is the next danger in the US. Will there be anything remaining of our political system? It's almost all gone now. Funny to listen to the people on TV about surviving the next 3.5 years -- what do they think will happen then? Nothing will happen, that's the most likely thing. Back to Frum, what a shame there's such a smart guy, so cloistered, and boastful about it. That's not a good way to proceed now imho. ",
