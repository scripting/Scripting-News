But they can't. “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it,” <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair\">wrote</a> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something\">Upton Sinclair</a> in 1935. It's still true 90 years later. Another great philosopher, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Moonves\">Les Moonves</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/les-moonves-trump-cbs-220001\">said</a> in 2016, \"It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS,\" referring to Trump's run for president.
