    "text": "A long time ago, based on my experience at Berkman in the 00s, I proposed the idea of a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html\">Developing Better Developers</a> function at a university, as a pilot, to create a teaching hospital atmosphere around creating new communication systems out the web and (key point) not compromising the openness of the web. It would be as sacred as academic freedom is in the university, or the First Amendment of the Constitution. It seemed to me that a university is the perfect place to create something like this. If we had such a setup, anywhere, at this time -- we would be working in earnest on an open alternative to twitter, one that is truly billionaire-proof right now, as opposed to \"would be nice to have sometime in the future.\"",
