    "text": "I'm working on a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/71\">baseline theme</a> for WordLand-authored sites. I want to show people how to get a good result with WordLand, even if they have plenty of experience with WordPress, but especially if they don't. I want people to look at a user's site and think \"Hey I want one of those!\" Not too fancy, just get out of the way and let the writer's writing stand out and look great. This is a replay of the work we did on \"Manila\" and then <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22radio+userland%22\">Radio</a>. I hope we're able to start a designer community as vibrant and productive as the one we had a few years ago. ",
