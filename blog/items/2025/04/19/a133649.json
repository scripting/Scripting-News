    "text": "I got a US Mail notice to answer a Census form, so being a good American I did. It was a <a href=\"https://respond.census.gov/acs\">.gov address</a>, and looked like a government form. The initial questions were standard census questions, then they started getting into personal things that I didn't like answering. Then they <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/19/censusFormPage.png\">asked</a> if I was born in the US. That's a really shitty question <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-trump-6f0cb929c4604ec1d9bf9fea99765b61\"> to ask now</a>. I was glad to see that I could just click Next without answering any question, and they got worse, more invasive, esp considering who the president is, and who he brought with him, so I just closed the page and wrote this post. I would, if I had it to do over again, not answered any of their questions, or maybe stopped at the standard Census questions from years past. ",
