    "text": "I feel about Harvard the way some people in tech feel about Xerox, Apple, Google or Microsoft. They gave me a platform to create. You can lead from a place like that. I hope Harvard doesn't throw that away. Now they have the greatest opportunity to lead. They can stand up tall and say no, we stand for freedom, and if that means you will destroy our campus, burn our books, take our money, the idea will still exist. If we surrender now, we may have a lot of money but the idea will be lost.",
