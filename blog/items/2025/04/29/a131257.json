Usually I don't criticize a service when it's down, because I can relate. We like to help each other when there are outages. But Bluesky is special, because they claim to be decentralized. If it were, it wouldn't go down unless the internet itself had. And since the internet, amazingly, <i>is</i> decentralized, that's not likely to happen. It was designed that way when it was developed at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET\">Arpanet</a>, a project of the US Department of Defense. It was designed to survive a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Inspiration\">nuclear strike</a>. Bluesky is nice, but it's fragile, and their hype says otherwise. That's why they're special. They should straighten this out so we can properly get decentralization into <i>our</i> networks. Bluesky could easily add a layer of \"RSS\" on top of what they have, so that news flow could survive a disaster.  In 2025 this is a realistic concern, as it was in the 1960s. Also it would be nice if other network experts would support this, esp if they're on Bluesky. This is not personal, if they wanted to get the RSS layer built, I would help them do it. We should all pitch in because then it would really be our network, and not owned by anyone. Live up to the promise, now.",
