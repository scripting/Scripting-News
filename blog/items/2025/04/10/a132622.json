    "text": "If I were a sassy Democratic Party leader I'd cop to being woke. \"Why yes I am woke. Aren't you?\" The Repubs have never explained why it's bad to be awake. Dems have to learn how to engage to win. Another one -- \"read, fire, aim\" is how Trump leads, just look at the tariffs, and it's been a huge disaster for hard-working American wage-earners of all generations. The \"all generations\" part opens an interesting conversation, how it isn't just old people or young people, it's also people who are working today whose earnings are being stolen, and those of us who have been working for 50 years who were paying into a fund so we could benefit when we retire. That money is coming out of your paycheck with no intention of ever paying it back. That's the Republican-run America. Not so great.",
