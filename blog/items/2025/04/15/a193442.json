    "text": "Looking for help from people who know how to create WordPress themes. The goal is to create a default theme that works well for \"WordLand\"-authored sites. It was suggested I try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/theme/retrospect?tab_filter=blog\">Retrospect theme</a>, and it does <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/04/15/siteshot.png\">look</a> quite nice when I <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/54#issuecomment-2807218882\">switched over</a> the <a href=\"https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/04/15/this-is-not-the-america-we-grew-up-in/\">daveverse site</a> to use it. Is it possible to fork a WordPress theme? If so, here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/54#issuecomment-2807241008\">list of changes</a> I'd like in a new theme. ",
