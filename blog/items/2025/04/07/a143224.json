And even if you believe they'll \"never do it\" -- it's still the right thing to repeat this over and over -- people should know they could. This should be repeated until enough people get it, this is being done <i>on purpose</i> by the Repubs. This isn't about winning elections, it's about understanding who's doing this to you and how deliberate it is. ",
