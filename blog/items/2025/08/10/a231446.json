In the meantime, I highly recommend the <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.megaphone.fm%2Ffloodlines\">Floodlines serial podcast</a> from the Atlantic. It's bingeable in an afternoon, tells an interesting story of Katrina and New Orleans. The interview with <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/white-house-event/katrina-10-years-later-brownie-youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-job/4548480\">Brownie</a> is <i>cringe</i>-worthy not binge-worthy, I skipped over it.
