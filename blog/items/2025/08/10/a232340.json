    "text": "One more bingeable, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lights_(2023_TV_series)\">Blue Lights</a> from BBC on HBO Max. I love police dramas, esp British ones. I watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)\">Peaky Blinders</a> earlier this year and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)\">The Fall</a>, another British crime drama, and, amazingly they all take place in Belfast, believe it or not, and don't count the number of times people say \"wee\" in the darndest places in BBC Belfast crime dramas. Do Brits really say <i>wee</i> all the time? How did I not see that coming. ",
