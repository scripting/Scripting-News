    "text": "I wanted to put together a demo of a very simple but interesting Node.js app, so I hooked up with <a href=\"https://replit.com/\">replit</a>, and was surprised to find out that it's now an AI bot. But when I asked it to make a sandbox for this app, which is in a repo on GitHub, rather than take the direct route, and run the demo.js app (which is what I asked it to do), it concocted a pointless user interface, that hid all the interesting bits. This was a demo for programmers for crying out loud. I <i>want</i> to show them the machinery in motion. I'm going to try again today.",
