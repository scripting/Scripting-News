I went to one of them, signed up for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test\">the test</a> mostly to get out of school for a day, and got in. Back in those days (the early 70s) no one studied for the test as far as I know. It has become very competitive and there's an issue of the racial makeup of the student body. As always Lehrer does a great podcast. ",
