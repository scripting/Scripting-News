That's why I spruced up <a href=\"https://lists.opml.org/\">lists.opml.org</a>, that's how we're connecting our servers. He's building this stuff to flow into his LLM via the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSocket\">FeedLand websockets interface</a>. He'll be updated on my subscriptions, and have his own, and the news will flow into his AI system. All of it can emanate from anywhere RSS is supported with a focus on WordPress. It's the secret sauce. ðŸ˜€ ",
