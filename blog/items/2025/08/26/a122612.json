    "text": "The <a href=\"https://this.how/web/what.opml#1756211321000\">consensus</a> among the people who responded to my what does \"on the web\" mean query is this. Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every \"page\" on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web. So for example, an iPhone app isn't on the web just because it has an information page that is. ",
