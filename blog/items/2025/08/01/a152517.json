We've had about the normal amount of hot weather, a good amount of rain but not too much. The <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/mets/standings/\">Mets</a> are doing OK. They opened a <a href=\"https://www.tibetphowoodstock.com/\">Pho restaurant</a> in Bearsville and it's good. Health, not too bad, all things considered. <i>Still diggin!</i>",
