    "text": "I did a rewrite of the <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?feedcorps=true\">FeedCorps page</a> in FeedLand. You get to it through the Reading Lists <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/09/feedCorpsScreenShot.png?nodialog\">sub-menu</a> of the Tools menu. There are three lists in the new version. A lot were false starts, they didn't make the cut. I'm always adding feeds to my blogroll and news.scripting.com. Unfortunately I can't say the same for podcasts, which are not hooked up to my podcast app. I really want a hot connection there. We'll get there. The reading lists feature is going to play a big role going forward in the open social web we're building. BTW, I really like the name <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=feedcorps\">FeedCorps</a>. I haven't talked about it very much. It's a cause, like peace or freedom. Open those suckas up. Feeds all the way babe.",
