One of them is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#:~:text=They%20took%20paradise%20and%20blew%20big%20holes%20in%20it%20that%20users%20couldn't%20find%20a%20way%20out%20of.\">here</a>: \"They took paradise and..\" At first, if you're roughly my age, you read \"They took paradise and...\" and recognize it as the beginning of a famous line from Joni Mitchell's <a href=\"https://genius.com/Joni-mitchell-big-yellow-taxi-lyrics\">Big Yellow Taxi</a>. The other is a subtle touch of sarcasm, that I usually try not to indulge in, but let pass through as I edited this piece. See if you can <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html\">find</a> it. ",
