It makes programming more of a challenge because as your software gets more features, there's more to remember and at the same time you're getting older. I wonder if there isn't some way to use ChatGPT to augment the aging mind dealing with more software complexity. It's very much in line with the idea I've had for a long time of putting all my writing in an AI database so I could then ask it to edit it down to book length. Or get a table of contents of what I think and then be able to read chapter-length sections on, say platforms, or how important prior art is, or what interop makes possible, and why everyone should give back when they take from open ecosystems. Each one of those topics has lots of associated stories over the years, but I probably couldn't find most of them, but an AI database certainly could. How to set that up? I've not figured that out so far. ",
