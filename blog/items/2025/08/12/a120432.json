I still want to use AI to power an RSS feed of news, customized to the interests of one person (me). My <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179118706\">query</a> is this: \"Create a summary of the news, top 20 stories with an emphasis on these topics: how people are using AI, especially in education, blogging, US politics, science news, the NBA and MLB, with a slight emphasis on the Knicks and Mets. The results should be in JSON format, with each item including: A brief one sentence summary, publication date and a link to a source where the reader can get more info. My software will then create an RSS feed with this information..\" The response was basically: \"I'm sorry Dave.\" Groan. Here are <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325#issuecomment-3179036482\">the details</a>.",
