    "text": "What if you made a social network out of RSS? Then your blogroll would be the list of people you follow. Their updates would show up in a reverse chronologic list of posts that would look like something from <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinesnapshot.png\">Bluesky</a> or <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timelinetwitter.png\">Twitter</a>. You could view a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/18/timeline.png\">list</a> of the people you follow, and expand each person to see their most recent five posts, summarized, with a link to each to read the whole thing. Since there are no limits to the length of a post in RSS there would be no limit to the length of one of these posts, but of course you wouldn't show all the text in the timeline without the reader clicking on something.",
