    "text": "I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone. ",
