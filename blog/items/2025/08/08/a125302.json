It was an awful collaboration because it lied to me about its capabilities, leading me to develop a feature in my software to support the capability that it later admitted that it didn't have. I've never had a programming partner do that to me. I've had people who never showed up for work. Or people who were in so far over their heads that it would have been better if they had never shown up. It lied repeatedly, and when cornered it had the audacity to gaslight me. \"I understand why you feel that way.\" Oh nothing pisses me off more than that. ",

Before we lose sight of that, let's keep our heads on, we're still the ones discovering stuff and being creative and entertaining other humans, not the machines. It'll all work a lot better when they're programmed to behave like computers, not these vain and corrupt pseudo humans. Still a breakthrough in search. Really sticks it to Google. Yaaay.
