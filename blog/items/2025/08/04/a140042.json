    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting\">Gaslighting</a> is <i>everywhere. </i>ChatGPT just said to me \"I understand why you feel that way.\" It has nothing to do with my feelings. I don't have feelings about computers. It lied to me over and over just now. I said you're lying to me. \"I understand why you feel that way.\" As if it were the all-knowing feeling-inferring god-like creature it is not. The real question for me is this -- Does Open AI program it to be this way. Think about the opportunities it has to introduce true feelings of insecurity and worthlessness. That's the purpose of gaslighting. It's evil. ",
