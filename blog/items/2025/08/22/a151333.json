    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers\">Baby boomers</a> have nothing in common except we were born in the same 20-year period. We didn't come up with the term, also -- it was given to us by previous generations when we were infants, or worse, not even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote\">zygotes</a>. There was no way it had anything to do with who each of us were or what we would become. All this is in response to the idiotic idea of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich\">little dude</a> who just wrote a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ROBERT-B-REICH-Americas-Economic/dp/B0FMD7876H/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3MQJJTEFB8PSZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g4ibja9uP1kYYBF13ImLxx8MrFyKHvaA93LcJoYIT7xNW6RN-z_DzNHG864S0EKhXt5HmX2gFZ21sUs0BOln_ubIAOz0oYcY4A0SuNo4sgIJHvRMyhjRvD7d6HXpVHHFsmcxEA17eVNjTkQYg7ocLP67CQAzzQgpiFX7AZj9f_4-XSBjmmEStej9FdNNofvuTS2zGUWwdMsSNYK4-EM1DgoLk9zGsxUImXuB17EzyHM.iOUwwGt2pQ_ndfxmAXm1yyJnXSrSIgwoHpY-3Cum40U&dib_tag=se&keywords=coming+up+short&qid=1755875758&sprefix=coming+up+short%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-2\">book</a>, nine years older than me, what a putz. He apologizes for boomers, feeding the bullshit idea that somehow we are a unitary thing. A lot of boomers voted for Trump. The boomers I come from liked the Grateful Dead and yes I know some deadheads voted for Trump, so there you go, more evidence that it's all bullshit. The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the <i>parent</i> of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw.
