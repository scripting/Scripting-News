    "text": "Today there is a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/186-dave-winer-on-decentralisation-wordpress-and-open-publishing\">new podcast</a>, this one for members of the WordPress community. I was interviewed by the very capable Nathan Wrigley of WP Tavern. I thought it was a great conversation, we talked about the remarkable position WordPress is in to serve as the OS for a rebooted web. I love the introduction they wrote, I also figured out how to make content management work in the browser, which was the foundation for blogging and eventually WordPress, though it seems that legacy is a bit lost in all the other stuff I've had my fingers in over the years. I hope you listen to this podcast, and if you have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/186-dave-winer-on-decentralisation-wordpress-and-open-publishing\">questions or comments</a>, here's a good place to post them.
