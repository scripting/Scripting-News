    "text": "\"It happened so slowly that we didn't notice but Twitter wiped out the idea of the web developer. The platforms we were trying to make work together were programmed so they couldn't work together.\" I didn't want to let that pass without notice. As the early blogosphere is coming back into focus, and given what we know about the before and after of Twitter, I'd say this was hard to see, I was too close to it, but now having gained some distance, and rebuilding the basics of the blogging with the tools of 2025, it has become clear. The age of the blog ended sometime after 2006 because people moved what they were doing in blogs to Twitter. It wasn't Twitter's fault, if the independent developers had been willing to pool resources to make certain things easy that were hard with blogs, we could have offered a good alternative that didn't make all the compromises on writing that Twitter did. That was unnecessary damage to the web. I'm now referring to that time as \"the rude interruption\" as in \"before we were so rudely interrupted.\" I am energized by the blogging energy that's come out of the two podcasts I did last week to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/09/23.html#a133652\">ActivityPub world</a> and the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/09/25.html#a130421\">WordPress community</a>. They may or many not remember blogging before Twitter, but they do viscerally feel that the web has unrealized potential. ",
