    "text": "I watched the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_(1995_film)\">Seven</a> last night, and I can't stop thinking about it. It got a shitty <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/22/movies/film-review-a-sickening-catalogue-of-sins-every-one-of-them-deadly.html\">review</a> in the NYT, which usually means I won't bother with something, but this time I decided to give it a try. The reviewer, Janet Maislin, didn't like the acting of Brad Pitt. I thought Pitt was an unlikeable jerk, but I also thought that was the role, but maybe I was wrong. I didn't care. I also couldn't figure out what city it was. It wasn't NY, but Maislin says it was. Usually in a movie set in NY, I recognize many of the locations. There are only a few places movies are shot in the city. But again, I didn't care. What keeps me thinking about it is the story. I'm not going to spoil it. Don't read any reviews before watching it, they pretty much all get in the way of the storytelling. ",
