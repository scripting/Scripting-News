We'll find a way to connect to you. That's the whole point.\" Indeed that <i>is</i> the whole point. I say it <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000\">like this</a>. \"Interop is all that matters.\" If our products interop that's pure love. The rest of it is baloney. Maybe I'm not a nice guy. Not my job. We've being fucked over by \"social media\" for 19 years now, and the new ones who say they're open, and on the web, and decentralized, are not. The only way out of this mess is what Evan said. BTW, I <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/115164714595757607\">sent</a> Evan a <a href=\"https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=daveverse\">pointer</a> to the subscription list which is my outflow. I use OPML for the list and RSS for the feeds. That's where you will find my writing. ",
