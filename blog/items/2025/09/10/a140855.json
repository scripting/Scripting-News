It is I believe going to make her blog feel less <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/blogs-don-t-need-to-be-so-lonely\">lonely</a>. If anyone else wants to get one going, I have more confidence that it's pretty do-able. <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/09/10/stephanieBlogroll.png\">Screen shot</a>.",
