    "text": "ChatGPT is great at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG\">SVG</a>. Describe the icon you want and in a few iterations you have it, even if it's not in <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/\">Font Awesome</a>. I would have killed to have this a few years ago, before FA came out. This is the best of both -- use FA if they have the right icon, design your own if they don't. It also makes me think that now perhaps SVG-based user interfaces are within the realm of possibility. CSS is no way to design UIs. I have a podcast in the pipe about this. If you want to know what I mean, look at the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/misc/quickdrawApiSummary.pdf\">docs</a> for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/06/19/152802.html\">QuickDraw</a>.",
