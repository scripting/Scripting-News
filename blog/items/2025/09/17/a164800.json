It was hard to untangle. It should be a lot easier, and next time I can dig in and do it over I think it will be. Anyway as I convert my demos, I'll list them here: <a href=\"https://mlbriver.com/\">mblriver.com</a>, <a href=\"https://politics.newsriver.org/\">politics.newsriver.org</a>, <a href=\"https://bloggers.scripting.com/\">bloggers.scripting.com</a>, <a href=\"https://dave.podcatch.com/\">dave.podcatch.com</a>.",
