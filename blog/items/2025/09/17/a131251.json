    "text": "In a piece I wrote yesterday <a href=\"https://daveverse.org/2025/09/16/can-we-finally-put-the-past-behind-us/\">on my WordPress blog</a>, I offered to do a virtual handshake with the people who worked at Netscape when it disappeared just as RSS 0.9.1 was being adopted by the blogosphere in 1999. I never considered their point of view, but in fairness, they never would talk to us except to dictate and dominate. In the <a href=\"https://daveverse.org/2025/09/16/can-we-finally-put-the-past-behind-us/\">piece</a> I try to explain how it all looked from my point of view, that of a developer who had adopted RSS 0.91 in favor of my own earlier format. Most of the stories miss the real innovator, and when you find out <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/martinLeavesTheTimes.html\">who</a> it is you will be surprised. (It's not me, most of my job re RSS has been fairly thankless and not creative, and definitely not profitable, but still worth doing because the web is the only place independent developers can work without the interference of big tech companies.)",
