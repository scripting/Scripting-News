    "text": "A couple of days ago I saw a <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@evan@cosocial.ca/115180872933751939\">post</a> from Evan Prodromou asking if I had seen a product announcement, and was wondering what I thought of the name. The name of the product was Really Simple Something. I said it was the first I heard of it. I did a little digging using ChatGPT and found they can do this, it’s not illegal or unethical. But it’s also true that you could invent a new format and call it HTML even if it isn’t what we think of as HTML today . The W3C would have no recourse. If you wanted to make a new CSS to compete with the existing CSS, no one can stop you, and you can call it CSS. Not a good way to run the internet imho. But that appears that's how it works. So as much as I didn't like what they did, esp the fact that the first I heard of it was a public announcement, and had no time to prepare or maybe even help them do something better, I guess we have to accept it. RSS has been through this before and came out okay. I just wish it would stop at some point. It's a useful thing, deserves <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/09/11/123936.html#a124132\">love</a> and support, not just from me, but from everyone, esp people who run companies that depend on it. You benefit as much as I do. End of sermon.",
