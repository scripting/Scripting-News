    "text": "A couple of days ago I saw a post from Evan Prodromou asking if I had seen a product announcement, and was wondering what I thought of the name they chose. It took a while for it to settle in that the name they chose was an obvious ripoff of the name of RSS 2.0. Then as people discussed it on their blogs, as they would normally do, seeing the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple\">Really Simple</a> name used for something other than RSS was jarring in a not good way. I kept my opinions private, and off my blog -- didn't want to distract from the really good work we're doing now. This was something that went back a long way. It was suggested I consider it a compliment, but that won't happen. I feel about it as Kurt Vonnegut might have felt if someone came out with a processed cheese product named Slaughterhouse Five. The people who did this to my beloved RSS 2.0, are not ever going to be people I am proud to know. There are a lot of people in the world, we don't have to be friends with everyone. But geez, why did they have to do that, and when is this corner of the tech industry going to grow up. All around bad karma. ",
