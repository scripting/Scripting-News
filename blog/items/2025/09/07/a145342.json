    "text": "Two videos every US resident should watch to prepare for what might be coming. 1. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others\">The Lives of Others</a>. A drama set in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany\">eastern part</a> of post-war Germany before the wall came down. People lived their lives, but their relationship with the government and the military would seem very strange to an American of 2025, But more of this is definitely what's on the way, and the technology for watching what you do is much better now, and our neighbors aren't any different, which is what the Germans depended on. 2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)\">The Handmaid's Tale</a>. Same kind of police state as in Lives of Others with a Christian twist. Everyone is a member of a caste. Most women are infertile since some unspecified disaster, and the ones who can reproduce exist only to reproduce. There are women who clean the house, and do a few other things. There are certainly other books, movies and series worth tuning into, but these are the ones I recommend now. Handmaid's Tale is also a book, which I have read, but the show on Hulu goes into more detail.",
