    "text": "Yesterday's <a href=\"https://openchannels.fm/exploring-wordpress-textcasting-and-open-web-standards/\">podcast</a> was with Matthias Pfefferle, who is developing Automattic's ActivityPub functionality. I talk about the totality of the app I'm building and the role WordPress and RSS play in the network. It's an all-web approach to social media. Another big podcast came out today, this one for the WordPress community. I'll write it up tomorrow. I'm on a press tour folks and having a great time. I think I finally found my tribe? And if you're in Canada, come to <a href=\"https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp in Ottawa</a>, October 15-17. I haven't given a public in person talk since April 2019. I'm realllly looking forward to this. ",
