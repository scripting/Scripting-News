    "text": "I went to NYC yesterday, drove both ways in the same day, which is a lot of driving. It was exceptional for me, two big cities in three weeks, Ottawa and New York. Had time to sit in Washington Square Park, then I rode a Citibike up to where I used to live near Columbus Circle. On the way I shot a video of a woman on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHMExdDXEiU\">West St</a> with a sign that said Honk For Democracy. I thought it was a nice shot, and typically NYers drove right by her, no honking, unfortunately. I also shot a video in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKaWr35gUwM\">Washington Square Park</a>. NYC is photogenic, interesting, and still where I come from, proudly.",
