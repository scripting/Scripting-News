I wanted to chat with both of them, and did, which was well-worth the journey. I <a href=\"https://daveverse.org/2025/11/05/mullenweg-and-borthwick/\">liveblogged</a> it. My chat with Matt helped me understand what we're doing. One of the things we talked about is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/11/06/141023.html\">an idea</a> I thought he would understand and love. It relates to their podcasting client, Pocket Casts, which I use. ",
