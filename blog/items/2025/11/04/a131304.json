His corruption led to what we have now. I will never love his memory. But I do remember that he <a href=\"https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/dick-cheney-trump-kamala-harris-1484000\">voted for Kamala Harris</a>. So, if you go deep enough, we shared the same vision for the country. As corrupt as he was, even he had a limit. We need more Republicans to do what he did. And I thank him for setting that example.
