    "text": "Democrats <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/democrats-score-biggest-wins-since-033721355.html\">swept</a> yesterday's election. A reminder that you should ignore pundits when they say what they've been saying about Democrats since Trump won last year's election. They assume people are stupid and aren't paying attention to the prices in the supermarket. And the price of health insurance. And the mask-wearing storm troopers occupying Los Angeles and Chicago. Heather Cox Richardson <a href=\"https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/november-4-2025-tuesday\">said</a> at the end of last night's piece that \"politics will be a whole different game.\" Republican incumbents now know that there better be big change, or they'll all be losing next November. They may find themselves more on the people's side than Trump's, now that they know for sure the two things are different. ",
