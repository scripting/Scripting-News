I had been using program compilers for C and Pascal for almost a decade when it came out, and it was shockingly different in a good way. Somehow it could compile a whole program in less than a second. Years before I had developed <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=ThinkTank\">ThinkTank</a> on the Apple II and IBM PC using Pascal, and it often took <i>minutes</i> to do the same thing! This changed languages in a great way -- later I would switch to <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22think%20c%22\">Think C</a> that had the same instant compiling. There were other great things about Turbo Pascal, because the editor was integrated, so you could start that compilation with a single keystroke. He understood that the quicker this was, the more in a groove the developer could get. Imagine if you had to wait a minute before you could read the prose you just wrote? It used to be like that. Going back to the 70s it would sometimes take many minutes, and you could run out of time, and wouldn't be able to change the software until they added more money to your account. Like the horse and buggy days. How far we've come. ",
