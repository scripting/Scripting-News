    "text": "October <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/10.opml\">blog posts</a> in \"OPML\". BTW, well-kept secret, I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog\">Node app</a> that takes one of these outlines and publishes it to the web, in the format you see on \"Scripting News\". If you can get your text to flow through OPML this way, you can have a replica of this site, with most of its features. And you can totally customize it in CSS.  It's open source and very stable. It's called <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog\">Old School</a> and I wrote it in 2017 because I wanted my old blog back, I was fed up with trying to fit into the very small world defined by Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook and Medium. I decided then the cost was too high, and I'd be much happier if I lived within the limits of \"RSS\", which is far better than the text formats defined by these other projects. Now I feel hopeful about this -- because <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22brent%20simmons%22\">Brent</a> is supporting <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=source%3Amarkdown\">source:markdown</a> in <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com/\">NetNewsWire</a>. This is a big thing, because it will have the power to attract authors, developers of blogging systems, and other feed reading products.",
