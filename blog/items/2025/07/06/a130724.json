    "text": "I saw that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/automattic-puts-tumblr-migration-to-wordpress-on-hold/\">Matt backed off</a> from porting <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=tumblr\">Tumblr</a> to run on top of WordPress, basically turning WP into an OS. I thought it was a brilliant idea, but probably overwhelming in complexity. But it was the right idea. We need fewer runtimes. If you can merge two runtimes, go for it. Anyway, this is all related to the \"open social web\" -- in fact it's central to it. We've got all these philosophically compatible platforms that are technologically unable to work with each other. But what if they all were really on the web? What could we build then? Everything. We would go back to the potential the web had before Twitter and Google Reader split the blogging world in two. I swear the answer is make it so that all these networks can do <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/04/14/121946.html\">inbound</a> and outbound RSS and build on the reality of the open social web, not just the hype.
