The <a href=\"http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=dave&collection=drummerdocs\">first version of Daytona</a>, built around an outliner. I got the impression people didn't like it, so I developed a new one using a more conventional approach, and I love that one too, and I did a better job the second time. But it's interesting to poke around the old one as well, and it still works, which is great to see.  In an alternate universe in the year 2025 the whole human species is organized by one big outline that everyone contributes to in peace, love and harmony, as opposed to this one which <a href=\"http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=grunts&collection=scriptingnews\">grunts</a> and <a href=\"http://daytona0.scripting.com/?q=snorts&collection=scriptingnews\">snorts</a> on Twitter and can't even put a freaking title on their posts.
