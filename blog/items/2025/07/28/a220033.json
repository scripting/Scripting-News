    "text": "Listened to a segment on today's <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl\">Brian Lehrer podcast</a> about how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home. Here's my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it when you're feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an act of self-love and give you some of the body <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin\">chemistry</a> that you felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian Trail. A similar idea in a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html\">Bruce Sterling talk</a> in 2009. ",
