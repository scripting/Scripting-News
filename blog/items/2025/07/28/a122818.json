    "text": "Why I need \"WordLand\". I’m primarily a writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each podcast is in writing the show notes. I have a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/69436e223b212315846f5944e0957504\">template</a> the writing and audio flow through. Here's an <a href=\"https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html\">example</a> of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the block-oriented work once, then flow my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady workflow thru the block editor, but their are workflows for designers and writers. WordLand is the flow for writers.  ",
