    "text": "I'm helping Automattic with their <a href=\"https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/4393-2/\">marketing</a>. The WordPress-Mastodon <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\">connection</a> is the world's best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove\">Dr Strangelove</a> where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was the point of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device\">Doomsday Machine</a> if they kept it a secret. I won't <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE\">spoil</a> it. Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it's easier to promote someone else's product than to promote your own. It's probably why you should always get a lawyer even if you're a world class lawyer yourself. Anyway, they have blown open something huge, and I very much want people to understand it, so it can create pull for the same feature in Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere. This goes with something I've learned in decades of experience in tech, people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors. And btw, I'm sure Mastodon, if it has an ego at all, is equally unaware of the great thing <i>they</i> have done. Here's a clue, writers were once empowered by the web, and that ended with Twitter. Now it's coming back. But it doesn't do any good if people don't know it's there. ",
