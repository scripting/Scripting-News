    "text": "I got tired of my old sound system, too many wires, a big receiver whose functions i never used, all designed way before the 4-year-old 65-inch OLED screen on top of it all, so I downscaled to a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWLCLZPS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1\">Sony soundbar</a>, figured that was as simple is you could get, for $300, thinking of it as an experiment. I liked it but then I thought to ask ChatGPT a question I've had for a while. I want a small amp designed for today's music and video, and went through a bunch of options and came up with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGCLXH4H?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1\">WiiM Home amp</a>. No speakers, unlike the soundbar, but hooks up to the TV via the ARC connector, and I have plenty of old speakers to try out in this configuration. I got it yesterday and the setup experience was pretty great and the feature list is totally 2025. Will have more to say for sure. ",
