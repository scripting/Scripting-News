    "text": "Today is Independence Day in the US, so how about an Independence Day for the web. One <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/07/04/181125.html\">simple way</a> would be to hook RSS up to ActivityPub, turning Mastodon and Threads into a big feed reader. It could easily be done in software, it would just take money to keep it running. Not something I could attempt personally. But I would totally help with the software and design. It would open the door for lots of new apps that could communicate with users through a single <i>simple</i> API. I want to talk with people about this at <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/06/22/132405.html\">WordCamp Canada</a> in October.",
