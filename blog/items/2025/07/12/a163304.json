    "text": "I want Mastodon to take off as a blogging platform. That means hooking it up to existing blog platforms. I want our world to connect to theirs. I'm lucky to have bet on WordPress, so my <a href=\"https://wordland.social/\">product</a> gets the connection to Mastodon for free. But the web is what matters, not my product or yours. Even if your product is huge, it's only part of the web. This is how we build, how we get back on track. Somehow we need to get a simple bridge that lets <i>all</i> blog content flow to Mastodon. That's the goal. I just wrote a <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/114841153889663929\">couple</a> of <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/114841162027579055\">posts</a> where this became clear to me. Who has the code and expertise to create a simple interface from the outside world to Mastodon. The interface doesn't have to be RSS. But it has to be maximally simple, and it has to cover the <a href=\"https://daveverse.org/2025/07/09/example-of-a-wordpress-post-in-mastodon/\">basic features</a> of blogs that Mastodon supports. ",
