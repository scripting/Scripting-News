    "text": "I took a long drive today on back roads, down toward Poughkeepsie, and on the way back a big pickup swerved into my lane. I had to swerve away from it and hit the brake, and had a bit of a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conniption\">conniption</a>. Got me thinking. Who was it that did this. Man or woman, young or old, spaced out or thinking about getting a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libtard\">libtard</a> to freak out, all kinds of thought. Then I remembered what keeps us safe in situations like this, very few people are going to deliberately try to kill us this way because they would die too. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction\">Mutual assured destruction</a>. But I'm a programmer, trained to always think of things that could go wrong, then I realized omg, what if it were a <a href=\"https://thenewswheel.com/this-tesla-drove-itself-to-its-owner-the-video-is-both-fascinating-and-alarming/\">self-driving car</a>? Someone could program it to assassinate a random or specific person, or worse, hack the car remotely, or hack a thousand cars everywhere at the same time to kill people all over the world. I thought we could prevent this by right now requiring there always be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice\">human sacrifice</a> in every car, sort of a hostage to assure good behavior, sometimes.
