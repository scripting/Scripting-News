If you have to choose between Google's web browser or one from your favorite AI company, which would you go with? Also yes -- Google is <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/googles-ai-is-destroying-search-the-internet-and-your-brain/\">destroying</a> the web, as is ChatGPT and Claude etc. Because the people who tried to capture flow using SEO made you wade through mountains of garbage before you got the info you were coming there for, if you ever got it. It's the same thing with clicking links in Twitter. If instead, they had focus on providing a product that made people happy and built respect for theri brand, they'd still have a seat at the table. It's too late to complain, you had a chance to view your efforts as a business. But there's still plenty of potential for the web, esp if developers get imaginative in how to use the new browser platforms. I don't imagine Google's going to rock and roll too much with Chrome, but maybe they will. ",
