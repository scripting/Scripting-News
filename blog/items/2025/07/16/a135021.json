    "text": "Someday <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton/69056237\">Manton and I</a> will make a very nice Markdown editor for Mastodon. Once it's working I'll pitch <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/company/history.html\">Rich Siegel</a> to do the same for <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a>. Along with the WordPress connection, that should nail it once and for all that Mastodon is a blogging platform. Manton is the right guy to do it, he has all the protocols implemented on micro.blog. All I want is a REST version of what the <a href=\"https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog\">MetaWeblog API</a> has been <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=MetaWeblog\">doing</a> since <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rssVersionHistory.html\">2002</a>. We're turning the clock back to move forward. Trying to undo the damage Twitter did to the web. ",
