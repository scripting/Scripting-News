I wrote it up on my <a href=\"https://daveverse.org/2025/10/30/markdown-support-coming-in-netnewswire/\">daveverse site</a>, which I edit with \"WordLand\", which means it has a <a href=\"https://wordland.dev/scripting/237777565/rss.xml\">special feed</a> that contains <a href=\"https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000\">source:markdown</a> elements. You can be one of the first people with markdown-support in your feed, and in doing so, help the bootstrap. If you have questions, post a comment <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/334\">here</a>.",
