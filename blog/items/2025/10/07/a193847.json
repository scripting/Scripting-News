You can always tell how long it's been by <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/07/bottomOfPage.png\">looking</a> at the bottom of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html\">any archive page</a>, where it's constantly calculating, down to the second, how long this blog has been running.
