    "text": "Question came up <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/tpm-25/can-substack-recover-the-blogosphere-we-lost\">on TPM</a> as to whether the blogosphere might reboot in Substack. The author concluded it can't, and I agree. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3m3rq5wpk6e2u\">Here's why</a>. \"One thing the blogosphere had that Substack canâ€™t have is all parts were replaceable. You could use any blogging tool, and any feed reader and still be part of the world. Substack is a single company that has raised VC money. Vastly different incentives.\" And this has been tested. You have to use their editor to publish in their enviroment. They're  unable to let you see their product as part of a toolset, it has to be the whole thing.",
