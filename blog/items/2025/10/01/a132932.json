    "text": "I started <a href=\"https://palfreylaw.wordpress.com/\">this site</a> to hold some of the essays <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey\">John Palfrey</a> posts on Facebook, where they are out of reach of the tools of the open web. John is a longtime friend, for over 20 years, and we did some <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=palfrey\">great stuff</a> together in the early days of the blogosphere. I will happily turn the site over to JP any time he wants, and provide personal support if there are problems. I want him in my online web family, and Facebook simply does not make that possible. It's a silo, as we know and that means it's basically a world unto itself. If we want to solve the problems of the world, we have to step out into the open space where what we write is not so local or controlled. ",
