    "text": "Great to see <a href=\"https://blog.lmorchard.com/2025/10/23/think-different-about-data/\">Les Orchard</a> reading my site again. We did some <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Les%20Orchard%22\">great stuff</a> together a long time ago in Frontier. He converted code from Perl (I think) to Frontier so I could use S3 for storage for users. I still use his code to this day. He's been writing of his memories of great feed reading tools of 20+ years ago, and I keep trying to tell my friend Les that the system we have now makes those products look primitive, as it should because so many years have passed. In 2022, I decided to give RSS another try. First I did a <a href=\"http://reallysimple.org/\">top to bottom review</a> of RSS, and then I built \"FeedLand\". If you loved feeds and mourn the day the music died, I have good news, it didn't die, you all just stopped believing it could happen. ",
