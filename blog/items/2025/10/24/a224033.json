One of them took an interest and puzzled it out and came up with a theory. When we tested the theory on the real data, it made a big difference. If it works in the deployed version as well as it did in the test, FeedLand will be better for this. ",

When you click on it, you'll see the <a href=\"https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=wordpress\">OPML list</a> for the page you were looking at. The list is dynamic, so it changes whenever the set of feeds changes. This has become a huge part of the systems we've built with FeedLand, that's why you see apps that are deployed on one server using data from a different one. The federation protocol for FeedLand is a simple and well-established standard for sharing lists of feeds, OPML over HTTP. Kind of like RSS was when we were just getting started with feeds, it's how you plug systems together. Esp if you can take advantage of the fact they're all dynamic. Also that they work really well with categories. Lots to say about FeedLand. Glad we're turning this corner now. ",
