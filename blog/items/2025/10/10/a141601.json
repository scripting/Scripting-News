A week from today. I find that exciting. I'll in the room for sure, and blogging it. Why not? ;-)",

It is still centered on WordPress as the place where all the user's writing is published. And somehow through the magic of software, we manage to make it into a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/05/boostrappingADecentralized.html\">social network</a>. And the cool thing about the whole stack of software we build on, all of it is replaceable and of the web, in every sense.",

But there are also many many things we can do with the structure that WordLand creates that the others can't touch. There's a simple reason for that, if implementing something, no matter how attractive, without limiting the web-ness of the system, we didn't do it. This is the social network of the web. That means all the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/753804.Small_Pieces_Loosely_Joined\">pieces</a> connect with each other in fantastic unforeseeable ways. And anyone can discover these connections. That was the joy of the early web, the thought \"Hey I think I can do that\" and when you try, it works! We're back there again, if the people come. The technical challenge is still there but now is smaller. Getting people to look and fall in love (hopefully) is the big challenge.",
