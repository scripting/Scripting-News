We were wrestling with this question at WC, how to market the feature in a way that would get people to go to WordPress to write for Mastodon. It would also be cool if you could turn on the ActivityPub connection in WordLand, without having to wade through all the menus and dialogs. Imagine if we had a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/10/19/activityPubDialog.png\">confirmation dialog</a> like this in WordLand.",
