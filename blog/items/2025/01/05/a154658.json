    "text": "BTW, in defense of Matt Mullenweg and the culture of the developer community he built over the last 20 years, for better or worse, they don't do what Bluesky did. They look for prior art and implement it and they don't deprecate. They're still running the APIs we invented for blogging before WordPress even existed. The philosophy is \"Let's not argue about decisions made a long time ago, because <i>we want interop.\" </i>People have all kinds of harsh things to say about their leadership, but unless you're a developer you don't understand that the reason it works is that they have a different code for their code, the only way we get interop is by <a href=\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod\">not re-inventing</a>. There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don't reallllly want us to work with them, or we wouldn't be having this friction. Their API is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate, like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html\">hamster cages</a> where everyone <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com\">gets</a> to run around in a very tightly defined space, that's fun. That's what Twitter was about, and that's what Bluesky is doing too. At some point we're really going to break free of this mess, but this isn't that time, yet.",
