    "text": "I wrote a few blog posts in \"WordLand\" this morning because it was convenient. It's good the same way I like to use a twitter-like app to write first drafts, when all I have to type into is my iPad. I've also started using it on my desktop for short things, but I just <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/01/wordlandScreen.png\">wrote</a> and edited a <a href=\"https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/01/gambling-has-infested-sport-in-new-unacceptable-ways/\">complete blog post</a>, a response to something <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-plot-to-poison-childrens-minds\">Krugman wrote</a>, about how gambling is destroying sports. And what for? It's like what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfI2iFvloso\">Marge said</a> at the end of Fargo. \"There's more to life than a little money, you know.\" It feels like they're feeding the NBA into a <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fargo-wood-chipper\">wood chipper</a>. What comes out the other side won't imho be recognizable as sport. And here you are, and it's a beautiful day.",
