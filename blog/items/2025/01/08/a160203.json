This included a JSON file of ratings for each user. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/binge2Data/blob/master/data/users/davewiner.json\">this</a> is my file. Remember we used Twitter identity then, <i>davewiner</i> is my Twitter username, just replace my name with yours to see your file, if you were a Bingeworthy user in the past.  ",
