So I did the deed, flipped the switch and now you can use it too. ",

I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for \"WordLand\", of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for \"Bingeworthy\". It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in \"Frontier\" on the Mac in the 90s. ",
