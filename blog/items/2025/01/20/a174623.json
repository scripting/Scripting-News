    "text": "BTW, actually the term \"social web\" is probably too big a compromise. The \"web\" part is the only part that's imho useful. The sad part is that \"social\" means \"we removed most of the features of the web.\" Why? Some vague sense that people would write too much if given the space. Or link too much. Or edit too much. Or be too emphatic. It's worse than Disneyfied -- at least at Disneyland you get actors, and color and rides, and bland food with tons of sugar and fat. But there is some fun and nutrition. In the social web, it's just memes and slogans. Not even much room for a metaphor. There's so much more to say about being human.",
