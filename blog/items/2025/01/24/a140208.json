My <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lgibxvpz3k2x\">post</a> about never forgetting Trump's coup attempt has already been RT'd 2.8K times, about three hours after it was posted. In all my years of using the \"social web\" I've never gotten that much attention. I have 11.7K followers, far fewer than I have on Twitter. By 5PM it had been RT'd 10K times.",
