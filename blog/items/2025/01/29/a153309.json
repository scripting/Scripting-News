    "text": "One more thing then I have to get back to work. There's a great moment in Woody Allen's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(1973_film)\">Sleeper</a> where a time traveler was told that the world was destroyed when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2fYguIX17Q&t=130s\">Albert Shanker</a> got hold of a nuclear warhead. If you lived in NYC in the 70s and 80s you knew <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker\">Albert Shanker</a> as a NY character like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton\">Al Sharpton</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa\">Curtis Sliwa</a>.  New York <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez\">had</a> its own semi-celebrities, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani\">people</a> who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow\">were</a> famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin\">mostly</a> in New York, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Abzug\">but</a> not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Koch\">as</a> much <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay\">outside</a>. So Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn't know it, back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it still feels like he's only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way. Isn't that weird?",
