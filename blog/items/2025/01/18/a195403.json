    "text": "I posted something to my <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social/post/3lfywyfwlci2x\">linkblog</a> this morning that really should have been on my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">blog</a>. Here's what it said. \"Every blog should have a nice search engine like mine. I can search for ideas and it creates a story, like this <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison\">search</a> for 'Madison' where I had love, fun, creativity, friends, youth, music, strength, health, sex, and could see the future clearly. Best time of my life, I had everything anyone could want. Pick another term get another synthetic story.\" Ironically, since my linkblog doesn't flow through the search engine, I would have lost this post. Which makes a bigger point. All the ideas we throw into the silo'd \"social web\" are basically trash, not part of our collection, that we might use tools in the future to find value in (as my Madison posts surely did, for me at least).
