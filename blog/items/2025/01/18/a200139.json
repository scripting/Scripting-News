    "text": "Anyway, today I hooked up \"Bingeworthy\" to \"WordLand\". Bingeworthy doesn't have a text editor, and it doesn't need one, because when it wants to offer a user a chance to explain their rating, like \"seasons 1 and 2 were great, but season 3 sucked, but I gave it a high rating anyway,\" they can use WordLand which loves writers and strives to serve them better and better. Why should I put a bullshit editor in a product (Bingeworthy) that isn't about writing. Its job is very different from WordLand's. Let them work together. That's the big idea, that's why you bother having <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop\">interop</a>, so you can use more than one tool on the same data.",
