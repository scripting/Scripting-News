    "text": "Then, I got a response from <a href=\"https://x.com/nickweaver/status/1880601723330506958\">Nick Weaver</a> and the Madison story continues: \"Hereâ€™s a roundabout Madison connection for you. I started working at UW 28 years ago today as the World Wide Web Editor in the Office of News and Public Affairs. My first project was to implement Userland Frontier for the university news page.\" Now Nick is in <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison\">my Madison story</a> too. And he mentions <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=UserLand%20Frontier\">Frontier</a>. With Frontier, we not only had the internet over networks, we also had networks on our computers because Frontier could send tasks to scriptable apps, and get back results. So databases could be hooked up to page layout programs, and people could use their writing tool of choice, and didn't have to use some teeny little excuse for an editor provided by a company that doesn't cater to or care about writers. Imagine writing with software that was designed to hobble writers instead of glorify them! That's the horror of the world as proposed by Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, all of them. It's like no one stopped to think about what they are doing, half their product is writing, and they suck at writing and have no plans to improve the situation. Geez Louise, it's as if we collectively lost our minds. ",
