    "text": "Today I spent (or wasted) hours trying to get my WebSockets code working properly with <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Caddy\">Caddy</a>. Hours with ChatGPT, realizing it has a long way to go before it can manage code like I can. It gets fixated on an approach and never takes a step back to think maybe we're going about this the wrong way. It's extremely annoying all the times it tries to take you off track, and it works, it does take you down <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole\">rabbit holes</a> and then you realize it's only getting worse. The key is to not let it do that, but it's hard not to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism\">anthropomorphize</a> so you don't want to hurt its feelings. In order to not be murdered as a small child you have to learn manners. And the bots push that too far. Really do take advantage. Still it knows far more than I do about everything, so if I could only get it to just shut the f up already and let me think! For something so capable it really doesn't spend enough time thinking, it's fully preoccupied with <i>doing.</i> ",
