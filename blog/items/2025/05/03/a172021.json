    "text": "The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons\">Detroit Psssstons</a> were truly great in the first round of the playoffs. And I was really gratified, ecstatic even, to see the Timberwolves give the Lakers a complete <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/11/04/131075640/how-shellacking-came-to-mean-defeat\">shellacking</a>. I am so fed up with LeBron James. I can't imagine another team would want him. I can't imagine why he wants to win <i>another</i> freaking title. And I was really pissed off when people started saying they were contenders this year. Bull. Shit. And the reason I'm glad it was the Timberwolves is because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle\">Julius Randle</a> is on that team now, and I hear he gets a fair amount of credit for their victory. The Knicks traded him for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns\">KAT</a> last summer. They're a solid team. And while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo\">Donte DiVincenzo</a> isn't playing very well, we really need him back in NY, so maybe the Knicks can figure out a deal that makes sense. And why aren't the Knicks playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa\">Precious Achiuwa</a>. He did great last year when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby\">OG</a> was injured. The Knicks have a good bench imho, they just don't get to play enough to be warmed up properly. So sad the way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride\">Doooooce</a> performed in the Detroit series. Anyway it was exhausting. I would have been okay with the DP's winning, seriously -- I'm ready for baseball. And I don't imagine the next series, with the Celtics will be any kind of a walk in the park.",
