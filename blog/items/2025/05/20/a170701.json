    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL\">MySQL</a>, which I'm using for <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bull%20mancuso\">Daytona</a>, has the idea of <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/3ec3cd5e-87d8-4a78-9356-464f2b26cf0d\">relevance</a> in searches. Previously I had been showing <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22\">results</a> in reverse chronologic order. So now, a <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22matt%20mullenweg%22\">search for Matt Mullenweg</a> gets the same results but prioritized by MySQL. This is the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/2857897ffe58bcb06362f00a7a72336a\">query</a>.  What's nice is that the results are focused on the early 2000s, when the standards we use now were coming up. We can do this kind of stuff again. There's more to do. For example, it would be really cool if <a href=\"https://pocketcasts.com/\">Pocket Casts</a>, their excellent podcast client, would let users publish their subscription list so we can build applications on them. There's a whole new base of data to work with. And unlike other media, podcast content is meant to be shared. The controversies that exist for professional writing and audiobooks, for example, don't apply to podcasts. If we could open this up, we could create an <a href=\"https://this.how/podcasting/#1733322866000\">ecosystem</a> worth of applications very quickly. OPML is an easy format to get into a database. We just need sources of interesting data.",
