    "text": "I turned yesterday's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/\">Baseline Playground</a> into a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground\">GitHub repo</a>. I never made one of these before and thought it was worth sharing, or just writing about. I'm struggling to find the most readable font, size, line-height. I'm looking at the screen where I do most of my online writing, and I find this very readable, it just fades into the background, to the base of the spine, so intrinsic it occupies none of my conscious mind. Anyway the purpose of the baseline is to give WordLand a target to work out all the glitches in, so the writing experience goes fully end-to-end. I didn't find any WordPress themes that I felt worked really well for this, so we set out to create one. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/scotthansonde\">Scott Hansen</a> who is using my work to build out a <a href=\"https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline\">WordPress theme</a> and thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jeherve\">Jeremy Herve</a> for helping us work with WordPress, which is more than a CMS, it's a network OS. There's a lot of value in the WordPress platform that has been widely overlooked, imho.",
