Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html\">rescinded his lifetime ban</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change\">now he can</a> be <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction\">inducted</a> into the Hall of Fame. He had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements\">more hits</a> than any baseball player ever. An amazing player. A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws. You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You don't give kids enough credit. What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will himself to achieve. I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn't I go for it all? I feel so sad that he couldn't have gotten the acceptance he so totally deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! :heart:",
