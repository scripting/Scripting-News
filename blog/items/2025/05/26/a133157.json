My friend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow\">John Perry Barlow</a> was a founding member. I figured if they could handle a Grateful Dead lyricist, and general muck-raking rabble-rouser like <a href=\"https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Barlow\">Barlow</a>, they might be able to appreciate someone of my creative caliber. They accepted me, gave me run of the place, defended us when we got in trouble and great things came from it. But I always felt like a bit of a thorn in the side of the great elite Harvard University. ",

And it might be that the people who would destroy it don't want to take the risk that Harvard might be heard, and it might be a bit premature for them to think they can take control of an organization that in a sense represents the best of the USA since 1636.
