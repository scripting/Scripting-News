I've been following the prices during the playoffs, never seen them this high. Courtside seats go for <a href=\"https://www.stubhub.com/new-york-knicks-new-york-tickets-6-2-2025/event/157266978/?quantity=2&sections=1717540&ticketClasses=17400&rows=2161980&seats=&seatTypes=&listingQty=\">$27K</a> each. BTW, there's no guarantee there will be a Game 7, first the Knicks have to win tomorrow in Indiana. ",
