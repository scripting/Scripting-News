I'm publishing these so people get an idea of the structures we're working with. It's basically a WordPress post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS, Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out, there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2, Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol, Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol designer, don't try to plan for things you don't have a working model of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together will work much better. And only add things you're willing to live with forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/85bc99f9dc055b220c43a6cde4aa6415\">this</a> is the format we work with inside \"WordLand\", and more important, in the new APIs, that build on and simplify the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpcom\">excellent API</a> that Automattic had already produced.",
