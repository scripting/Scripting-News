My <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg\">friend</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey\">John Palfrey</a>, who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I'm going to publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the places I'm hooked into.",

Of course there are extremely talented lawyers working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing, to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with impunity.",
