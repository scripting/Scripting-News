Pretty much the same people who brought us the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> too-big-to-fail meltdown in 2008 and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot\">Brooks Brothers Riot</a> in Y2K. Not sure if <i>oligarch</i> is the right word. Peter O'Toole starred in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ruling_Class_(film)\">The Ruling Class</a>, a favorite when I was younger.
