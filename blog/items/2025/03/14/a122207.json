    "text": "Please, today -- write a blog post that explains why you believe in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html\">The Writer's Web</a>. That's the best way to express our ideas on the web is with all the <a href=\"https://textcasting.org/\">tools</a> that writers have invented. And while we may enjoy using social media like Bluesky or Mastodon, we understand that they are not for writing and are not the web. Please <b>send me a link</b> to your post and I will read what you've written with thanks for believing in writers and the web! You can use any blogging software you like. My email address is dave.winer@gmail.com. And thank you. (And btw, your post can be about whatever you like, by just writing a blog post you're expressing your support for the writing on the web!)",
