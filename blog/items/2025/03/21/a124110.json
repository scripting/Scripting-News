A ChatGPT with instructions on how to help a user with \"WordLand\". Try clicking the <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support\">link</a> and see what happens, esp if you're a regular WordLand user. I discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right. I've been using ChatGPT to develop the product, so it's possible it has retained some of the info. And the <a href=\"https://this.how/wordland/\">docs</a> are on the web. This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to ingest everything it can find. Worried about hallucinations. But with a product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests are not problems with WordLand itself. Here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/62\">thread</a> where you can report on your experience. Remember the <a href=\"https://this.how/commentGuidelines/\">guidelines</a>. Thanks! ",
