    "text": "You know how they have <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/national-walkability-index-user-guide-and-methodology\">walkability</a> scores for different places? I live in a place now with a score of zero, you can't do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a <a href=\"https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019\">score</a> of 99. I'd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out. Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its network, but doesn't reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on \"textcasting\", and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs). ",
