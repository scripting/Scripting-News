    "text": "I asked <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/67d580b2-8a68-8012-ad1a-65f2553978bb\">ChatGPT</a> when Google started making HTTPS a requirement. Then I asked when was HTTPS first deployed, and was surprised it was in 1994 in Netscape Navigator. But apparently it was really buggy and wasn't codified until much later. Then I asked when HTTPS became the norm? 2017. So there's a lot of web out there that isn't being maintained by anyone, it just works, that predates HTTPS being widely adopted, if you believe the timelines ChatGPT produced. ",
