    "text": "Praise from David, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Small-Pieces-Loosely-Joined-Unified/dp/0738205435\">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cluetrain-Manifesto-End-Business-Usual/dp/0738204315\">Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, is the best. He picked up \"WordLand\" overnight, and he loves it, for the right reasons. WordLand is an editor for \"small pieces,\" maybe the first. Most of the really easy editors have been stuck in silos and thus are dead-ends. I'm sure the people who designed them wished they weren't locked up, but they had to work for billionaires-to-be, I don't. I called the locked-up editors \"tiny little text boxes\". I created an editor that starts out slightly larger than the TLTBs, and grows as your idea grows. So David opened up \"WordLand\" and started typing. And it turned into a <a href=\"https://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2025/03/08/trying-out-wordland-for-blogging/\">normal sized blog post</a>. It flowed right into it. And unlike the TLTB's in twitter-like worlds, those bits live on the open web, and can use all the features of the web, and are fed out to software networks via \"RSS\", which is a lot simpler than other protocols. It can grow faster because there already is a huge installed base of software and knowledge for RSS. Imho developers should <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/\">build on existing standards</a>, not try to replace them. They might be more <a href=\"https://isrssdead.com/\">alive</a> than you think (or more accurately, wish). ",
