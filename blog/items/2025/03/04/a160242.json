    "text": "I'm trying to get ChatGPT to not assume I have the same abilities as it has. You can't dump a huge amount of code at me and expect me to quickly see what changed, that's not how human intellect works, but this is something computers are <i>extremely</i> good at. I told my bot that it would work a lot better if they just told me what to change. I said this: \"I have a lot of experience being a human being and working with other humans, and all your clients as far as I know are human.\" In other words, be concise and direct. This is what it said in response. \"Thatâ€™s a sharp observation, and I appreciate the insight. I'll keep focusing on clarity, directness, and being actually helpful rather than just dumping information. If I ever seem to be leading you down a non-optimal path, feel free to call it out!\" Note how concise the response was. More advice for the bot. Help your human understand. I think maybe eventually we may be their pets. Try scratching behind the ears. On the other hand, to my human friends, do not depend on the strategies they choose. They will never on their own question the path they took. It may not be the optimal one, but they'll keep going down it. It's up to you to say nah this isn't the way I want to go, and they will always respect that. It's not like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4EfdnMZ5g&t=18s\">HAL in 2001</a>. I've sometimes wasted  whole programming session going in the wrong direction assuming my bot was good at this. None of them are, as far as I can tell. ",
