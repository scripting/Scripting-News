    "text": "People are trying to figure out the answer to Substack. The answer <i>isn't</i> that people should run their own servers or buy their own domains. You don't have to buy a bus to take a bus to work, you can rent a seat, it's a lot more economical. You don't have to find a place to park the bus, or pay to maintain it, someone else is happy to do that for you. What you need is a pass that lets you ride the bus. What that means for services like what Substack does, is you need a place to store your writing, that you pay for. And an app can get at (with your permission) and take a document that you specify and mail it to the people you allow to subscribe. You pay for that too, but it's not much because it doesn't cost much. The piece that's missing is storage you can pay for that doesn't come with a dot-com business model. That's the thing we really need to esccape from, being monetized. The only respectful way to be monetized is to pay for something worth paying for, roughly what it costs, plus a reasonable margin of profit. ",
