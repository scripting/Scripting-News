    "text": "I am going to ask for a discussion about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">Wikipedia page for RSS</a>, because I think it misses the significance of \"RSS\", how it became a big thing. It had little to do with the quality of the technical work, there wasn't much of that, and the <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798834000\">quality varied</a> as has been pointed out many times. What made it happen was a vision by some exec at Netscape (whose name is never in the writeups, probably because it isn't on the Wikipedia page), a pitch, and a leap of faith by publishers: Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. And if they hadn't, there wouldn't have been anything worth fighting for. I never would have gotten involved, and blogging might not have been part of RSS, as it was. Then, a few years later, the NYT. And then everyone. It's an interesting story, imho -- and it would be good to make the story available to future would-be innovators. Don't design a perfect format and expect the world to beat a path to your door, it doesn't work that way. You have to keep coming back to the problem, try a new approach, gain some traction, and hope you're not going down a blind alley. The actual story of how it happened belongs on that page. ",
