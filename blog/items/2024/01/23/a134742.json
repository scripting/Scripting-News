But I did write a piece on what made the Mac different on the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html\">25th anniversary</a> in 2009. BTW, the comments on that piece are incredible. Click the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html\">link</a> just to read the freaking comments. ",
