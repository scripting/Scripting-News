It won't be long before he has an idea for how spreadsheets should work, or a writing tool, and getting ChatGPT to write it for him. It'll be ready to download before he can load the page. We just have to make sure the open protocols are there for him to build on. It's possible that's not something the bots will be able to do on their own. ",
