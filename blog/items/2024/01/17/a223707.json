Politics is a lot simpler than most sports, and they repeat themselves for years even decades, yet the sports reporters manage. Not all of them, there are plenty of empty-headed sports reporters. But there are also some very insightful ones. It makes all the the difference. In New York basketball we're blessed with two of the best. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Breen\">Mike Breen</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier\">Walt Frazier</a>. I'd listen even if I gave up hope on the Knicks, which believe me, I have done many many many times. Also Olbermann says that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan\">Dolan</a>, the owner of the Knicks, is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck_(pejorative)\">schmuck</a>. He got that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html#aWIOSI\">right</a>. But somehow this time he managed to hire an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Rose\">exec</a> who has some kind of a clue. ",
