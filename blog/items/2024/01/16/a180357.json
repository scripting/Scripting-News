I am a paying user, I don't want to do any more than I'm currently doing with it. I just want to be able to keep an archive of everything I do, in a format that's more useful to me.  (Update: They do have a simple API, <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction\">documented here</a>.)",
