It's a TV show, acting and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief\">suspension of disbelief</a> are what count. It has nothing to do with anything else. Sorry it has to be that way but that's how it is. I don't think they hate women btw, they would have voted for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr\">Roseanne Barr</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_McCarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a>. Maybe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock\">Chris Rock</a>, they probably would have <i>really</i> liked <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith\">Will Smith</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy\">Idiocracy</a> was incredibly <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=prescient\">prescient</a>. No joke. ",
