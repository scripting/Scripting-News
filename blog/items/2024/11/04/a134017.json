    "text": "Tomorrow if you are an American, and haven't voted yet and are thinking of sitting it out -- get off your butt and get out there and do your civic duty. We need great turnout this year, record-setting turnout, as a show of love for our country and our Constitution. Vote now, because later you might not have any power to change direction. Tomorrow, you do have power. <b>And remember that voting is not you expressing yourself, it's not free speech, it's you and I governing. </b>This is our moment of greatest power. Use it or lose it.",
