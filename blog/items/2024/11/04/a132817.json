They must know the basic rules of journalism, imho that's much easier than the know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a <a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/\">view from nowhere</a>, trying to understand what they're writing about. They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. ",
