    "text": "Ben Thompson wrote in his <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a> newsletter: \"What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective itâ€™s a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!\" I wrote in 2017, that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html\">some Repub would buy Twitter</a>, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now. When I begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612\">didn't</a> miss this.  \n",
