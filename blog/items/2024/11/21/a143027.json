    "text": "When people said they didn't know Kamala well, they weren't kidding. She didn't start broadcasting until three months before the election. That's barely one season of Young Sheldon. They were right. We should be marketing the hell out of this shit all the time. I listened to a pathetic Daily Blast podcast <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/big-setback-for-trump-as-gopers-privately-tell-him/id1728152109?i=1000677605316\">yesterday</a> where Greg Sargent and his <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-cabinet-team-of-outlaws-gaetz-hegseth-gabbard-rfk\">guest</a> kept saying \"we gotta figure this out.\" The answer is staring you in the face. Dems are only on the air for a few months every four years. Of course the other side spins you like crazy. You all are clinging to the \"gotcha\" model of journalism. There are no more gotchas. We've known that since Access Hollywood. Fetterman is the only Dem I know of who understands this. Get on the air and relax and say what you really think. And when the Repubs lie, say it like that -- they're lying. When you say nothing people think you agree with them. Big point. What happened that didn't register is that politics no longer runs through journalism, it runs <i>around</i> it. It's taking the Dems far too long to figure this out. It's an extinction-level event for this party. The time is here, now. ",
