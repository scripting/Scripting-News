First time I witnessed this phenomenon was with a few product marketing <a href=\"https://www.wildcraftmeats.com/brat-type/wunderbrat/\">wünderbrats</a> at Apple in the early 80s, smart people (not kidding) but not nearly as smart as they thought they were. A big part was the serendipity of being in a <a href=\"https://hobees.com/locations/\">Hobee’s</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside\">Buck's</a> when Steve Jobs or a <a href=\"https://www.kleinerperkins.com/our-history/\">Kleiner</a> partner was having <a href=\"https://hobees.com/breakfast-menu/\">breakfast</a> after a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape#:~:text=Initial%20public%20offering%20(IPO),-The%20original%20green&text=On%20August%209%2C%201995%2C%20Netscape,to%20US%2428%20per%20share.\">big IPO</a>.",
