    "text": "Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season\">starts all over again</a>. With love for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&t=315s\">heart of gold</a> team. Either way we win, imho. I know you're not supposed to feel that way, but that's how I feel right now. During the game, if we're losing, based on recent experience I won't like that so much. :smile: ",
