Why, after so many years are we still so controlled. When did we give up?\" I think you can do the design with words and dialogs, btw. Here's a great <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/18/facebookDialog.png\">idea</a> for keeping threads focused and civil on Facebook. You can limit comments to people who have a stake in being on good terms with the author. This keeps the hit and run <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/05/13.html#a015747\">turds</a> from dropping.",
