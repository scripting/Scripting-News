    "text": "Now that I have my \"blogroll\" as a regular feature in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">my blog</a>, I am able to keep current with more bloggers. It's actually much more than a blogroll, it's a feed reader. When a feed that I'm following updates, it moves to the top of the list. And if I want to <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/08/blogrollscreenshot.png\">see what's new</a>, I just click on the wedge next to its name to reveal the most recent five posts. From there, I can get to the full post by clicking on the permalink. If you want to get a feel for it without taking the plunge yourself, you can leave my blog open in a browser tab. You'll get exactly what I get.",
