    "text": "A free idea for Apple that might boost their stock price. I use the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134\">Voice Memo app</a> to take notes while I'm programming. Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an <i>edited</i> version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end). I understand that <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\">$AAPL</a> is depressed because the lack of an <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html\">AI story</a>. Here's a use that every stock trader will understand immediately. Huge value. I'm sure others are doing it. But Apple has the high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I've owned a bunch of Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and I'm right.) ",
