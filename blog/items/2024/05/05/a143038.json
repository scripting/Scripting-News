    "text": "Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. \"Now you can create your own formats!\" The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, \"they don't really mean it.\" This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage\">umbrage</a> at the <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah\">chutzpah</a> of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a \"standard\" and thus was born Atom. My opinion, <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000\">one way is better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the \"RSS\" bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\">trying</a> to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\">trying</a> to do that. It isn't going away. :smile:",
