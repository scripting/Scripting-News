Almost all playoff series that aren't sweeps are intense, but this one was especially so. So we're on to the <a href=\"https://fox59.com/sports/pacers/schedule-released-for-pacers-knicks-playoff-series/\">next round</a>, starting Monday, back in NYC, against the Indiana Pacers, an excellent team this year. And Doc Searls, who is also a Knicks fan, now lives in Indiana, so he is somewhat justified in believing the world revolves around him. I've always had that sense about Doc. ",
