I think the Repubs learned something after one of their own boasted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/02/kristi-noem-response-dog-killing\">she killed her own dog</a> with a gun. They learned that Republican voters think the right to bear arms does not make them hate dogs and to their surprise <i>they don't endorse shooting them.</i> Maybe shooting Jews, immigrants, people of color and libruls and libtards of all flavors would probably be okay but for crying out loud not dogs!! They're so freaking cute. ",
