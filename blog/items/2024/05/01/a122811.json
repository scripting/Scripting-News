    "text": "I have to admit I like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=tyrese+maxey\">Tyrese Maxey</a> of the Sixers, who <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40061591/amazing-maxey-late-burst-helps-76ers-stay-alive-ot-win-knicks\">spoiled a Knicks victory</a> last night that would have closed out the first round of the playoffs. It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on <a href=\"https://www.msgnetworks.com/\">local TV</a> with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier\">Walt Clyde Frazier</a>. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms\">narration</a> is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like <a href=\"https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/\">Archie Bunker</a>. I keep wanting to <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means\">say</a> \"I do not think it means what you think it means,\" but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;\">next game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan\">owner</a> of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?",
