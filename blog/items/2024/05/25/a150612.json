    "text": "And while we're tripping out on the new revolution, we're still reaping huge value from the last one. I've loved various music over my life, but with Wikipedia having pages on the history of all the Beatles songs, for example, or Steely Dan, or whoever -- and with the <a href=\"https://500songs.com/podcast/\">500 Songs podcast</a> -- I can learn the stories behind the music. The Eagles and Steely Dan had the same manager, and they liked each others' music and they did shoutouts in their songs, but I wasn't in on it. You can now find all that. The great thing about these tools is we all get to construct a very real history. A lot of the misinformation, which is the weakness of Wikipedia, it tells stories from only one perspective often enough, because that's how the power flows, but all that is erased by ChatGPT, amazingly. So if you're into history, which is our story after all (a big deal imho) you should be thrilled, because at least at first, the next level builds on the previous, and blows all other media off the map in terms of utility and accuracy. The exact things the journalism is mocking. ",
