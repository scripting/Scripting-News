    "text": "I feel like crap today, the Knicks were blown out by the Indiana team, the series is tied 2-2 but it feels much worse. The headline in the <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/12/pacers-blow-out-knicks-tie-series/\">Daily News</a> reads \"Pacers blow depleted, dead-legged Knicks out of the water in Game 4, tie series 2-2.\" Yeah. I don't know how we recover from this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. \"It's been a great season, but we're tired. We're headed to the beach, we'll see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support.\" I would nod my head and say \"Yeah that makes sense.\" Whatever. I may spend today sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for sure, and yes, I will watch.",
