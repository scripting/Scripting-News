    "text": "This year's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:New_York_Knicks_roster\">Knicks</a> are as memorable as the 1970 <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/1970.html#all_roster\">team</a>. Brunson, DiVincenzo, Hart, Anunoby and Hartenstein. They have totally distinct superpowers. Tonight's game will be played without Brunson and Anunoby, both injured. That means McBride and Atchiuwa start, probably. I kept wanting to tell friends about these guys, they're just as exciting as the starters. And don't forget there's another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_Sims\">center</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burks\">forward</a> still on the bench who have done real starting minutes this year and two years ago. They are Knicks too.",
