    "text": "August 15, 2004: My <a href=\"https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/08/15/augustCoffeeNotes.html\">audio blog post</a> from NYC, from my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml\">Podcast0 feed</a>. Had just listened to an Adam Curry podcast and one from the Gillmor Gang. Played a bit of music, described how a podcatcher would work, pretty close to the way they work today. Shortly after the feature would be in Radio UserLand. It was the only episode I did in August 2004. The next one is on September 1 and there are a total of nine shows in September, including the first <a href=\"http://secrets.scripting.com/\">Trade Secrets</a> which is a podcast Adam and I did together. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/08.html\">archive</a> for this blog in August 2004.",
