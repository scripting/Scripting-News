I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html\">at the DNC in 2004</a>, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? :smile:",
