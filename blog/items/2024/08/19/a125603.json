There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS 2.0 spec</a>, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.",
