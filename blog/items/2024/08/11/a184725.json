I don't mind doing hard work, I just don't want to hear what the NYT-centered media has to say because it's all \"bullshit\". If I have to listen to nonstop bullshit, I'd rather hear from people who tell me we can have a bright future, than the usual NYT-spawned \"bullshit\". It's just \"bullshit\". I'm tired of \"bullshit\". That's all I have to say about \"bullshit\" for now at least. Have a nice day.",
