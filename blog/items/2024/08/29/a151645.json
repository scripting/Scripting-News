    "text": "In elections we get to say who we are, ie who comes closest to who we are. It's all made of imagery. Bernie Sanders is someone you either love or don't. He reminds me of people in my own family, who I would <i>never</i> want to be president of anything. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug\">this ad</a>, the best ever imho, says wait a minute, please reconsider. A campaign is a series of messages from candidate to electorate: \"Is this who we are?\" The great ads tap our optimism, imho. The Sanders <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug\">ad</a> says we're nice happy people who have jobs and help each other.",
