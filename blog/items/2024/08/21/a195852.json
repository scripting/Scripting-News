    "text": "Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks\">most powerful political statement</a> I've ever heard. \"Who's going to tell Trump the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs.\" The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or another, we <i>have</i> changed. America in 2024 is vastly different from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my feet are planted in, we realize that there isn't a black America and a white America, there's just one America. We finally have come to accept ourselves as we have been all along. ",
