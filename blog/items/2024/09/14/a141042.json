I'd like to ask for a picture of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry\">Chuck Berry</a>, and get something nice and be able to put him in a scene with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wordle+kitty%22\">Wordle Kitty</a>. That seems pretty harmless. And the news industry could hardly object, they didn't invent Chuck Berry, or own the copyright of the picture of him in Wikipedia.",
