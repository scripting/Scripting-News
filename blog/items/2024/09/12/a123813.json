A couple of months ago, I was practically begging him to do this. He was pouring so much unfocused energy into making journalism play an appropriate role in our democracy. When Jeff started posting to his blog, it gave his friends something to point to. This writing had much more impact than a random tweet. Journalism crossed a line they should not have crossed. Now we fully expect them to try to do it again. We have to find a way for our ideas not to be scattered in the wind, so thorougly ignorable. And in doing so, I'm convinced we'd find a better way to organize the electorate online so it's more immune from unwise and unfair manipulation from the journalists. At the same time <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor\">Dan Gillmor</a>, who was also scattering his ideas about, has started a <a href=\"https://cornerstone.ghost.io/\">newsletter</a>. Dan was a real blogging <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22dan+gillmor%22\">pioneer</a> as was Jeff. We remember how this kind of thing boots up. We can set up any kind of distribution system we need. What matters is the collection of brilliance. Individuals are not so powerful unless they come from one of these. ",
