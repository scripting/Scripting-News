    "text": "Another fantastic thinker and writer who is mostly scattering his ideas -- <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dan+conover%22\">Dan Conover</a>, who when he comes out with a piece, I stop everything and sit down and carefully read it and savor it, because not only is there sure to be new info and new ideas, the writing is sooo good. He's a former local reporter in South Carolina. I met him on a road tour I did a bunch of years ago. Where does he post this stuff? Facebook. I want it to be part of the concentrated web writers union. Maybe think of it as my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/05/01/143422.html?title=iWantMyKarass\">karass</a>, my version of The Atlantic, perhaps. Or my version of the op-ed page of the NY Times. I think there is definitely enough good stuff out there, unorganized, to easily rival them for originality, depth of thought, experience and great writing. Dan is on my list of such superheroes.  ",
