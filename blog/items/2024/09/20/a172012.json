    "text": "This is a test. For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of a new server app that combines the functionality of several apps I used to run as separate servers. The goal is to be able to integrate the functionality of all the components. It's time to invest in blogging in a real way. The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html\">2017 corner-turn</a> was about getting back to the foundation I had before trying to co-exist with Twitter, Facebook, Medium. All three are now no longer high value targets for interop. So while I wasted a lot of time trying to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/09/08/152655.html\">peer</a> with them, I did finally get off the horse and I had a decent setup while developed \"Drummer\" and \"FeedLand\" and in doing so learned how to do scalable server apps with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\">SQL</a>. I've wasted so much time trying to be compatible with apps that didn't want us. I have a feeling that none of the current targets really want us either. So let's get back to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html\">Open Web</a>, which gave us much hope before. I think we can do a lot with feeds and \"OPML\". They're to open systems what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\">GPL</a> is to open source. You don't get to be half-committed to being open, you have to be all-in or you can't play. (Same idea as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+podcasting\">podcasting</a>, which of course is just an instance of \"RSS\".) You don't have to deal with a lot of confusion to find the interop. You just have to be willing to look in that direction. This started out as a test post and look what it has become. ",
