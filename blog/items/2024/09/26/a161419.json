    "text": "The <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAYZWUXpEyJ\">question</a> came up on Threads as to whether the ActivityPub support in Ghost will be a full two-way presence in the fedisphere, and apparently the <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@quillmatiq/post/DALtxZ_PiiX\">answer</a> is yes. They are working on a feed reader that also hooks into AP. That's how I would have done it. Really feeds and tweets should always have been peers. If you want to know the history, blame Google Reader for that disconnect. Also it highlights the need for a <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAYm3v5JLLe\">news-zine</a> focused on the \"social web\". When the PC first came out there was PC Mag and PC World and then PC Week. Same for the Mac. And there was InfoWorld that covered everything. Now we're basically using smoke signals between users. A few really interested users could bootstrap a blog to keep track of what's going on, and share what you learn publicly. That was the advice I gave <a href=\"site:scripting.com arrington\">Mike Arrington</a> and he started TechCrunch and that acted as the glue that hooked together the early blogosphere, feeds and ultimately twitter and its offspring. We need it again. Users and developers party together has never been more needed as now.",
