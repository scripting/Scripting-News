Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts, whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being heard <i>all the time</i> was his biggest sin. Harris should get accustomed to being accessible when she's in office. Keep the <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/\">kamalahq</a> snark channel going. This will have been Trump's contribution to American politics, no fear of being heard. ",
