    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/09.html\">September 2004</a> was the month when podcasting became a real community thing. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html\">Twenty years ago</a>. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html\">podcasting got its name</a>, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them \"audio blog posts\" or some variant thereof. You can see it in this <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=podcast\">Google Trends</a> graph. I started a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml\">special feed</a> to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298\">Apple's podcast</a> database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. <i>Still diggin!</i>",
