    "text": "Heather Cox Richardson has a great read on how discredited Hur is, it was a total partisan hatchet job, done from inside the DoJ. And none of the big journalists even asked the question -- where is this asshole coming from. Our journalists, today, who protest that we need them to keep our democracy, and then they assassinate it. When are we ever going to stand up and put a stop to this. BTW, Substack where she hosts her incredible writing, makes it impossible to find a web link to a story you recieve via email. It's very easy to get to the article in their app. I prefer the open web, and always will. I don't want Substack's app. Because I couldn't find the URL, even by searching for it, I can't give it to you. Sorry. ",
