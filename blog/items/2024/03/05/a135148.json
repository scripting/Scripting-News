Not some fancy media critic opinion or an editorial. A real report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability.\" A regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her liking, she accused me of being a MAGA. It's so totally not true, and typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to a non-journalist opinion about journalism. ",
