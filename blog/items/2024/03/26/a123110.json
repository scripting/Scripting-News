There are good arguments that she should be in a prisoner of war camp, not employed by one of America's major news networks.",

The reporters refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is where journalism goes wrong imho. Maddow <i>should</i> know the details, and if she does, she is obligated to share them, because they are significant, and go to how much trust any of us should give to any news coming to us from NBC. Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It's similar to the \"news\" she reported on Facebook, except now instead of steering us to believe lies, she's holding it back, and instead of it being about one very powerful social media company, it's about the future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn't know, as <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something\">Upton Sinclair</a> once said: “It is difficult to get a [person] to understand something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.” ",
