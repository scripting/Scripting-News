Screen shot to the right. It shows that the art was very much still being practiced then. It looks cared-for. All themes designed by Bryan Bell. I am going to set up a demo of the home page, because I want to look at it as \"live\" as I can get it, and see if there are ideas there I want to bring forward to 2024. ",
