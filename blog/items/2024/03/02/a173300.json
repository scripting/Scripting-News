    "text": "Ben Werdmuller <a href=\"https://werd.io/2024/why-i-wont-have-a-blogroll\">explains</a> why he won't have a blogroll. This is the kind of thread we used to form in the old school blogosphere. I don't have an opinion about whether he will or won't have one, but for me, the process of putting this together in 2024 has been a really good thing. I'm better in touch with what other people are doing. My blogroll does more than it did 20 years ago. Actually it's a lot like his <a href=\"https://sources.werd.io/\">Sources page</a>, but more compact. I'm glad we're having this discussion. It's <i>exactly</i> what I hoped would happen. And of course my feed list is behind my blogroll. ",
