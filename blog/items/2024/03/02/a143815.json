    "text": "When I was a grad student in Comp Sci, I was a teaching assistant for a class in <a href=\"https://ece252.ece.wisc.edu/ch07_inclass_01_assembly_language.pdf\">assembly language</a> programming for a couple of years. One of my responsibilities was to grade the work of the students. Later, I was the CEO and lead developer at a software company I founded, and there I had to review other people's source code. I was pretty fussy about writing understandable code, because it was my job in both places to understand their code, and I also knew, even when I was just a TA, how important it is that your code be human-readable, not just machine-readable. I just want to say if ChatGPT were a student of mine, its code would get an A+, with thanks from the teacher for making my life easier. ",
