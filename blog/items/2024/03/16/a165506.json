    "text": "Saying the web <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social\">misses</a> Google Reader is like saying the United States misses President Trump. Why do I think that? Think of the mess Google left behind when they dumped the web. Putting all our cards in one basket in software is a very very very very bad idea. As everyone who misses The Orange Feed Reader is evidence of. It's like someone rips you off bad and all you can think about is how much you miss them. You, sir or madam, need to get your head examined. \n",
