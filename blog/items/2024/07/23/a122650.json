    "text": "I was able to follow <a href=\"https://x.com/kamalahq\">kamalhq</a> on twitter. This <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lover-elon-musk-already-145940678.html\">report</a> says that Musk is rate-limiting followers on that account.  Of course we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html\">warned</a> what could happen if a Republican bought twitter, but I didn't honestly contemplate that a fascist would. These days our greatest fears aren't scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh. BTW, if you want to know why we're so thrilled to have Harris as the candidate, even though we didn't want Joe to give in, it's because no informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it). Today it's the hope that we won't be deported or worse.",
