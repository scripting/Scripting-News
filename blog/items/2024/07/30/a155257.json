Biden has the potential of being as great a president as Lincoln. Let that settle in for a moment. I get goosebumps when I think about it. If he hadn't taken that stand, he could have become known as the US equivalent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II#Life_in_exile\">Kaiser Wilhelm</a>.",
