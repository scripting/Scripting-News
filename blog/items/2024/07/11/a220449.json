    "text": "I think it's pretty obvious that Biden will step aside, in favor of VP Harris. Behind the scenes the Democratic Party seniors, Pelosi and Obama for example, are working with everyone, including the president, to make it go smoothly and to spend the time between now and the convention getting ready to launch a super competent campaign aimed at the jugular of the MAGAs, from Trump to Leo to the six thugs on the Supreme Court, getting us ready to clean up the mess in January. I doubt if they'll do a great job of organizing the voters, but maybe we the people can do something there. As part of the deal, the NY Times which stepped far out of bounds for a news org, should agree to get back to reporting news, and let the Democrats manage their own party, unless the NYT wants to declare itself to be part of the Democratic Party. Their inexcusable behavior over the last year, esp the past couple of weeks, and in the 2016 election, makes it impossible to view them a news org. They may not like this but believe it or not the readers have a right to speak too. The owners of the NYT should listen. ",
