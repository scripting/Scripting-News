    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/07/27.html\">On this day in 2004</a>, I did podcast interviews with <a href=\"https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/07/27/interviewWithDonMeans.html\">Don Means of Meetup</a> and <a href=\"https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/07/27/interviewWithPattyWetterling.html\">Patty Wetterling of Minnesota</a> at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. For both, I did the interview with Natasha Celine of the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040804051308/http://pacificviews.org/\">Pacific Views blog</a>. The next 2004 podcast won't be until <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/08/15.html\">August 15</a>. Banter with Adam Curry and Steve Gillmor probably about the podcasting bootstrap which at this point appears to be underway. Not sure if anyone as ever gone down this path in the last 20 years because, when I do the searches to find links to sites and people, I don't see any mention of this stuff in the current day, although now there will be (here in my blog archive). Here's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml\">the feed</a> of ancient podcast review. You can find the reverse chronologic list of the whole series on <a href=\"https://morningcoffeenotes.com/\">morningcoffeenotes.com</a>.",
