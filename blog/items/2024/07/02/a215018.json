    "text": "My favorite soft drink these days is <a href=\"https://preview.us.coca-cola.com/products/coca-cola-flavors/cherry-zero-sugar\">Coke Cherry Zero</a>. It's got a really nice taste. Went to the store today, they only had one 12-pack, but they also had a 12-pack of <a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/coca-cola/products/coca-cola-spiced\">Coke Spiced Zero</a>. I decided to give it a try. I had a can at lunch and it's weird but okay I guess, but the belches are strongly flavored and that's <i>realllly</i> weird. It took me a while to figure out where this <a href=\"https://www.prevention.com/health/a32925734/why-do-my-burps-smell/\">belch-breath</a> was coming from. It tastes like I took some very strong medicine. The weirdest soft drink I've ever had. But it kind of grows on you. I'll try another one and let you know how it goes.  ",
