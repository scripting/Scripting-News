    "text": "And btw, of course they're fascists. They were fascists before they <a href=\"https://www.project2025.org/\">uncloaked</a>. Trying to take the government by force is one of the most fascist things you can do. How could anyone with a high school education not see that? If that isn't fascism, what is? Also the recent Supreme Court decisions are fairly fascist. The president is not accountable for anything he does. We know that in Trump's first term he was constantly hitting guardrails. Like when he called the Secy of State of Georgia on a line that could be recorded (and was) to ask him to throw the election. How differently might that have gone if the request was made in a way that didn't leave such a clear trail? If Trump had been a little more competent at seizing power, it would have worked. In the interim, he's attracted a lot of lawyers and financiers, possibly some military people (though not visibly), who know what they're doing and have had plenty of time to prepare. Trump was a fascist long before he was president. We lived with that for four years. If elected, the next four years are going to prove even more deadly. I haven't forgotten the million Americans who died in Trump's last term, have you?",
