    "text": "An eye-opening <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/leader-jeffries-talks-biden-politics/\">segment</a> on Brian Lehrer's <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.simplecast.com%2FC8a1jmw4\">show</a> today. The first half is an interview with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries\">Hakeem Jeffries</a>, you can skip that part, pretty standard stuff. It gets interesting at 17:50 when they take calls from listeners. A lot of different points of view from people of all ages, they're incredibly passionate, well thought-out, coherent. This is way better than the punditry you hear on news. The real crime here is that the insiders of the Democratic Party are taking control, after they were manipulated by the press. A total insider's route-around of the democratic process, it's just as bad imho as what the Repubs are planning around Election Day. The press did the same thing to NY governor Andrew Cuomo, who was elected by the people, and forced out without any legal process, and certainly not a vote. That experience argues in favor of when you're in doubt, do the thing the voters said to do. Anything else is very very questionable. Why are you taking control? Where are you authorized to do that? I think perhaps some of the Dems forget how huge an issue this was in the 2016 process. ",
