    "text": "<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/07/6-6/\">Matt says</a> some interesting new stuff is coming from Automattic now that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/07/dorsey/\">WordPress 6.6</a> is out. Something for writers? Perhaps something that moves WordPress into a space adjacent to twitter-like systems? They just added support for <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@davew\">Threads</a> to WordPress, so now you can <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/social/\">crosspost</a> from a blog to a thread. Haven't tried it yet. They also have a new <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\">identity system</a> built around Gravatar, announced in early June. It'll be interesting to see what they come out with. I wonder if there is a developer ecosystem building on this, and if they have an evangelism program. I have my own vision of how these things should work. ",
