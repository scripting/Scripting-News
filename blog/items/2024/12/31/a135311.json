    "text": "Sad to say the current \"WordLand\" testers are not using it enough to help break in the software. It's a good product, and for people who do a lot of writing in WordPress, I think it would be very useful, maybe even transformative. But I can't open it up until I'm fairly sure it works reasonably well for people who write decent bug reports. Not only does that put a lot of stress on me, it doesn't work, in the end no one hears about the product, or if they do people will say they tried it and it didn't work. I'll keep thinking about wait to entice people to be among the first users of the product, but so far my efforts to get testers involved have not worked. I could be a guest on WordPress podcasts, but I'm afraid if I do that, a lot of people will try it and quickly find out it doesn't work. That's why I want to do the testing <i>first.</i> So it has a chance to shine. But if you don't do a lot of writing in WordPress, I understand it can be hard to make the time. ",
