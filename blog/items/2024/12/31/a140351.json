    "text": "As I'm going through this, I regret that I didn't do WordLand long ago. WordPress is a solid foundation, and having written lots of blogging software over the decades, this project felt a bit like a homecoming, or time travel even. What I learned is that as WordPress evolved, it added strong features for designers and programmers, but not enough for writers. And for me, that's where the juice is. I am a writer, and as I view it, all the design and coding works to serve writers. That's where I hope to make a contribution to imho righting this ship. ",
