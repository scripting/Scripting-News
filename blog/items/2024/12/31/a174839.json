    "text": "After <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter\">his death</a> at 100 on Sunday, the news has been full of talk about Jimmy Carter. It's not polite to say it's exhausting and boring, and seems pointless. Then I happened to hear Jimmy Carter himself, on the latest <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/30/g-s1-40405/former-president-jimmy-carter-the-fresh-air-interviews-part-1\">episode</a> of the Fresh Air podcast, and that was fantastic and totally worthwhile. It had been a long time since I listened to him, and I've grown a lot since then. Listen to the person, much more interesting than people talking about the person.",
