I've wanted to have a nice non-XML way of viewing the feeds in an OPML subscription list. I took the time today to put one together. I had all the pieces, it was just a matter of putting them all in one place. You can use it if you want, if you want to show someone what feeds are in an OPML subscription list. <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/29/screenshotopmllistviewer.png\">Screen shot</a>.",
