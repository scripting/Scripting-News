    "text": "I get my greatest ideas walking, riding my bike, on a ski lift, or sitting in a hot tub esp when it's really cold out and there's a full moon as there was last night. Sometimes the ideas prove workable and other times they're like the great brainstorms one had with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_boom\">cocaine</a> in the 80s, not that I would know, but have heard. Anyway, I was daydreaming about what I'd do with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy\">Bingeworthy</a> if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that Netflix thinks I'd like, because their idea of what I'd like is bullshit. I find that I'll like almost anything that's rated in the 80s by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I'll give almost any NYT <i>critics choice</i> a go. So what I really want in the middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well. Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway, then <i>boom</i> it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345\">in the outliner</a> could actually do this. Now I'm going to need to be able to call ChatGPT from a Node app.  ",
