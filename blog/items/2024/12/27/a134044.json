    "text": "Last night's email had a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1mXNfI1cbU\">YouTube video</a> in it. I had forgotten that they get lost somewhere in the email delivery supply chain, so the fire that I put in the email was <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/27/emailscreen.png\">not transmitted</a>. It's even worse than it appears. Here's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1mXNfI1cbU\">link to the video</a> of the fire, with any luck that will get through in tonight's email. Happy holidays everyone! ",
