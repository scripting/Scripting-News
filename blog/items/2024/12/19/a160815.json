    "text": "I watched <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber\">Ari Melber</a> last night and noted he isn't yet on Bluesky or hasn't updated his show graphics to include it? He usually tries to be leading edge in this, and at this point he looks a bit behind the times, imho, ymmv etc. After Melber, I stayed through the opening segment of Joy Reid and was charged up by her intro. She's clicking on all cylinders. They must be thinking about gutting or reconfiguring MSNBC at this time. It's up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/01/msnbc-comcast-cable-news-for-sale-elon-musk-trump\">for sale</a>, I wonder if a billionaire will see the wisdom of owning that piece of real estate as Musk saw the value in Twitter, far beyond what the stock market valued it at. (BTW, I should add that I benefited from his largesse, I was a very <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/15/0295.html\">small shareholder</a> in Twitter at the time. I did not want to sell, but my vote didn't matter. Heh.)",
