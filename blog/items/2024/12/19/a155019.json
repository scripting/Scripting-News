    "text": "I've been thinking about <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty\">Blogger Of The Year</a> for a few months, and had a choice (not yet final), but then <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Krugman\">Paul Krugman</a> left the NYT, set up shop <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/\">on Substack</a>, and has been totally kicking ass every day for the last week. Presumably these are all things the NYT wouldn't let him run? Or if he submitted them, would they edit them into mushy nonsense. I've been there, I quit Wired when they edited my pieces, with my name on them, where I said things I thought were inane, things that I most definitely did not say. There's never been a better illustration of the importance of blogging and the value that's removed by publishing in the NYT. If a <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2008/10/13/princetons-paul-krugman-wins-nobel-economics-0\">Nobel Laureate</a> like Krugman can't get his ideas out that way, with the huge advantage in circulation they have (as Wired did over my humble blog), then there must be a reason to have blogs after all. I don't think he will be my BOTY for 2024, but maybe next year, if he keeps up the intelligent irreverence. ",
