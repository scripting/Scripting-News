    "text": "Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is \"textcasting\". It was what I needed to build \"WordLand\", it defines its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of. Defining a new network where if you want to play you'll need to start thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can't be on the open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into copying and pasting into \"tiny little text boxes\", that's how you know you're in a silo. If you can use any writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty simple. Right now -- <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None. ",
