    "text": "When Bluesky was experiencing its huge post-election surge, it was exciting because lots of us users were experiencing the surge in followers and engagement. It was exhilirating.

The character limit on Bluesky being considerably less than the others makes it harder to rekindle interest imho. And btw the euphoria being gone is neither good or bad, it just is.",
