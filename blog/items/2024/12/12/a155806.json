But if they ever actually stop showing scripting.com, which will always be plain old HTTP, I'll probably ship an Electron product that browses the web, and doesn't care if it's HTTP or whatever new fad Google is promoting. I'm going to <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hold-the-fort\">hold the fort</a> for the original web. I can't change scripting.com to HTTPS, it would break all the images and probably a lot of other stuff.  ",
