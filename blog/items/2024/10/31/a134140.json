    "text": "I did the first demo of my new editor to a couple of developers I'm working with on our ActivityPub project, something I'm ever-more-excited about. Happy to say the demo was a success. They appeared to love the product, and for the right reasons. It makes WordPress into a fantastic writer's platform. This is what I love to do more than anything. People think I'm most interested in protocols and formats, but that's just part of it, and not the main part. I love making writing tools. I got interested in that in the late 70s working on editors for programming languages, then ran a company that made the same kind of editor, outliners, for writers, and then with Frontier went back to programmers. Now I'm trying something new. I want to create a whole category of editors. Editors where none existed before but should be there. The web. Instead what we have in 2024 is a lot of \"tiny little text boxes\" that hoard your writing making it pointless for developers to compete for writing tools that writers love. So writing on the web remains something that's not for writers. That's freaking stupid! Anyway right in the middle of all this is the perfect product, really a platform -- WordPress. It needs 100 great editors. I'm going to provide the first, and the toolkit to create more. Then Murphy-willing I'm going to create another editor, to show that it can be done. Then I'm going to kick back and smell the roses, a lifetime's work done, so now I can play. It's looking like the plan might just work.",
