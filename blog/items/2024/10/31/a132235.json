    "text": "Progress on the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/10/30.html#a170135\">YouTube TV</a> front. Thanks to all the responses, I've gotten F*cks News out of the startup position, but it still appears in the upper left corner of the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/31/noMoreFucksNews.png\">2-by-2 news multiview display</a>, and thus is the default, and when I launch it I hear them talking which is not pleasant. Further I always have to see what their freaking chyron says, and the commercials from the <a href=\"https://www.10news.com/news/fact-or-fiction/fact-or-fiction-mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-selling-pillows-for-price-linked-to-nazis-and-white-supremacists\">Hitler-fanboi</a> pillow salesman. Basically I want to be able to see what they're doing <i>when I want to,</i> but never have it forced on me. Help. ",
