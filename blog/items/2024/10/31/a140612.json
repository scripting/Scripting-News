    "text": "What <a href=\"https://qz.com/elon-musk-donald-trump-economy-stock-market-tariffs-1851684972\">Musk has been saying</a> is cover for what the oligarchs did to the Soviet Union as it was breaking apart. Only the US has vastly more wealth. And unlike Trump, Musk understands how money works, presumably Putin does too. They want the entire flow of cash that's generated by the US economy to go through them. So \"richest man in the world\" doesn't begin to cover Musk's ambition. He wants \"all the money in the world.\" Forget about any benefit from government, that's over. The health care system would fall apart. The situation with abortion is just the beginning. When Musk says it'll come back better after a few years, that's a lie. Something like that never comes back. We've encountered this before, when the Repubs were threatening default. ",
