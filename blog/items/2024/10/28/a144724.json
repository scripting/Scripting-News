    "text": "I started to read Ben Thompson's email newsletter <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/trump-on-rogan-the-voters-decide-the-podcast-election/\">Stratechery this morning</a>, it was about Trump on Joe Rogan's podcast, which I didn't want to listen to, because I am overdosing on Trump, again. I was surprised to see it begins with the story of podcasting, which has my name in it, which was gratifying. A lot of people will read that. I'm including a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/28/stratechery.png\">screen shot</a> of the beginning because his newsletter is not something you can read without a subscription.",
