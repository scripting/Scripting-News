    "text": "I like that Michelle Obama spoke to men in her speech, but it could have been done in a way that enters the male brain easier. I know there shouldn't have to be an easy way in, because child-bearing isn't easy, but we need more men's votes to win this election. Pragmatically, bending over backwards, with love and acceptance, not blame and threats, makes it more likely they'll listen. All of us who need health care need to be heard and believed, and most important -- helped. Anyway, to the men reading this who are planning on voting for Trump, think about the women you care about, and how you would feel if they needed help to survive and because you voted for Trump, that help didn't arrive in time. Would you forgive yourself for voting not to restore equal care for women if it caused the death of a friend or family member you care about? It <i>really</i> is that serious. ",
