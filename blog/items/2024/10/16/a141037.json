    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber\">Gruber</a> gave me an idea when he put his <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/16/daringFireballAndJankeesLogo.png\">NYY logo</a> on his <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/\">blog</a>. I thought that was both interesting and weird. I don't get how anyone I know can be a fan of the that team. An American League team in a National League city. Kind of like rooting for Staten Island. Anyway, the Yankees may win the <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2024_ALCS.shtml\">ALCS</a>, but what does it mean? It's not going to make New York love them. But then Gruber is in Philadelphia so why isn't he thinking about the Phillies, who btw, the Mets beat soundly in the division series, earlier this month. In any case, I have made the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/16/mets1969TeamPicture.png\">team picture</a> of the 1969 world champion Mets as the banner image on Scripting News for now and into the forseeable future.
