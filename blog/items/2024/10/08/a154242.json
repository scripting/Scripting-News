    "text": "<a href=\"https://guykawasaki.com/\">Guy Kawasaki</a> and I have been going back and forth privately about what we want from our personal ChatGPT. Here's one thing for the list. When I go to Google and search for NBB, it should take me to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html\">this page</a> on my blog. It shouldn't even require me to click on Feelin Lucky. That's the problem with Google. It's had a million years to get to know me, and it still thinks I might mean <a href=\"https://nbbank.com/\">National Bank of Blacksburg</a>. Google is clueless compared to what I've become accustomed to with ChatGPT. They and everyone else are completely missing the boat here. Folks, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">this</a> is my blog, read it and use it when I ask a question. Also they don't have to even read my blog, \"NBB\" is defined in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/glossary.opml\">glossary</a>, which I make public and is used in rendering all my pages.
