When I go to Google and search for NBB, it should take me to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html\">this page</a> on my blog. It shouldn't even require me to click on Feelin Lucky. Google has had 26 years to get to know me, and it still thinks I might mean <a href=\"https://nbbank.com/\">National Bank of Blacksburg</a>. Folks, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">this</a> is my blog, read it and use it as context when I ask a question. And they don't have to even read my blog, \"NBB\" is defined in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/glossary.opml\">glossary</a>, which I make public and is used in rendering all my pages.

He has written about it, in the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/05/the-art-of-evangelism\">Harvard Business Review</a> in 2015. But his story is, excuse me, bullshit. I should record a podcast about what an evangelist is, as I was very well-schooled in this by Guy. Let me try here. ",

How is the tilt determined? Intuitively. If some random schmuck approaches him out of the blue at a developer conference, and explains their problem, where most BigCo people ignore them, the evangelist listens carefully. Helps without a second thought. And his door is open, if the developer wants to follow up. He helps route his needs through the organization. No developer is on their own if Guy is there. ",

The level playing field approach, which most tech companies follow, results in dead developers and platforms whose capabilities go unexplored. Users get bored, and move on to where the excitement is.
