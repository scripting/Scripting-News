When we were starting to plan the first BloggerCon, he took me on a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030604105516/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stories/storyReader$291\">tour</a> of the campus looking at places we could use. It was incredibly generous of him to do this. ",

Apparently it wasn't part of the archive that Automattic is hosting. That's too bad because there were a lot of \"firsts\" at the top level of the site, but it may have gotten lost when the site was converted from \"Manila\" to WordPress quite a few years ago. But they were able to find a snapshot of the page <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030604105516/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/stories/storyReader$291\">on archive.org</a> (I had looked but came up empty) and there is this amazing picture of Palfrey that I had been looking for and never found, and now it is found once again.
