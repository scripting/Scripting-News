    "text": "I keep writing on my hybrid <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113322998712983125\">WordPress/Mastodon blog</a> at my kitchen table. This morning I wrote about why I don't believe in the Ya Gotta Believe, a baseball slogan coined by a 1973 Mets pitcher Tug McGraw. It's on-topic because the Mets are in a challenging series with the Dodgers for the National League championship. No matter how it turns out, this is a historic year for the Mets, and no matter how it turns out I won't love the Mets any less if they lose. I think true believers believe in that -- love -- without any expectations, win or lose, or maybe <i>even more</i> if they lose. BTW, I know the rendering of the post isn't complete on Mastodon, and there are errors. I'm working with the people at Automattic at getting this right. I'm glad to see that Mastodon has the flexibility to do that. Anyway, I believe in the things I believe in, not because I \"gotta.\" I don't like the slogan because it doesn't reflect how I feel about the team. My philosophy is respectful (in a way) of the teams the Mets beat, because I understand that their fans don't love them any less because they lost. If anything I think the better slogan for the Mets would be this: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wait+till+next+year!\">Wait till next year!</a> :smile:",
