The series is now 3-2, and returns to Los Angeles tomorrow. So we don't have to tear down <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field\">Citi Field</a> after all. If the Dodgers win it'll be in their own stadium. The Mets were magnificent! Absolutely inspiring. A three-run home run by Alonso started things off. Everyone got on base. Doubles and triples. It wasn't without the concern that our wonderful and lovable Mets would do the usual Mets thing and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they held out. The final score was 12-6. We're still in it. Lets go Mets!",
