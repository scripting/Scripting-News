    "text": "I've mostly kept Trump off the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">home page</a> of this blog since he left office in 2021, but things are changing, and this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the resistance <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&smid=url-share\">is exhausted</a>. Bullshit. We're very well rested. The NYT is a den of assholes. They should explain themselves, or it's time to set up a receptacle for leaks from within so we can get the truth about who's selling us out to Trump and Putin inside the NYT so we know who to blame. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist, next year or the year after, Murphy-willing. ",
