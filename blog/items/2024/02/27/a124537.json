She has a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kara+swisher+burn+book&hvadid=673834124081&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1023511&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=4553868743109009067&hvtargid=kwd-2231804831244&hydadcr=22122_13323353&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_1th6nk73pi_b\">book</a> coming out. I think she's popular with other journalists. Her theme appears to be that it's the personalities that matter, not what the companies do. I don't think she has a whole lot of insight into the products and technology. For some reason tech, which mystifies a lot of history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her.   ",
