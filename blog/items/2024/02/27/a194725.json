    "text": "In the 80s there was a tech press that reviewed software, and explained OSes and hardware, so you really had a good idea what was going on. They just don't do that anymore. Haven't for many years. But along comes ChatGPT and I can get a <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/e8b8e861-4345-45c4-a5bb-8e5b7432b240\">comparitive review</a> of hosting services that compete with Digital Ocean, just by asking for it. I wanted to get an idea of how easy it would be to create an open source app so it could be easily deployed, on any of them and what the pros and cons were. I asked for a comparison between Digital Ocean (where I host my servers now) and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and I threw in <a href=\"https://glitch.com/\">Glitch</a>, just to anchor the whole thing simplicity-wise. Even InfoWorld wouldn't have done such an in-depth review. This is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity\">productivity</a> revolution, at least.",
