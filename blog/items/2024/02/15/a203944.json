    "text": "I thought ChatGPT could <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/openais-newest-model-can-generate-videos-and-they-look-decent/\">make a movie</a> for me, so I sketched one out. \"I'd like a video showing a middle-aged man skiing down an intermediate slope, looking excellent and confident. It's sunny and there are bumps on the hill, and a few other skiers on the side of the slope with expressions of astonishment that such an old person can be such a snazzy skier.\" Instead of making the video for me, it wrote a <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/578996d7-3e42-4fa8-8a9a-f827059234ed\">creative plan</a> for me. That wasn't what I had in mind! :smile:",
