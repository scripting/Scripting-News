    "text": "Thinking out loud. It would be interesting if every feed for a wordpress.com site included the <code>site_ID</code> of the site it came from, and if every item had the <code>ID</code> of the item it came from. A WordPress-aware reader might be able to do something with this. Or if it knew that the user owned the site it came from, it could open it in a simple editor. I was thinking through a use-case and came across this idea. Isn't it time for there to be a WordPress namespace? After all it's not only a big part of the web, it's also a big part of the feed world. ",
