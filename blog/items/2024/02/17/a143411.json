I kept a blogroll on my home page because those were the sites I wanted to check regularly to see what's new. So I was thinking about my own use of my blog, not just helping out sites I support or giving ideas to people who read my blog. Also they didn't provide an illustration of what a blogroll looks like. Here's a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000815061940/http://scripting.com/\">snapshot</a> from August 2000, and sure enough, in the left margin, there's the blogroll. Here's a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/17/blogrollScreen.png\">screen shot</a>.",
