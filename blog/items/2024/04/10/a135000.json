    "text": "For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I don't trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working life dealing with bugs in software. It's very easy for me to imagine what could go wrong. I don't understand how people can trust a computer with their lives this way. It's also disconcerting that the car coming at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone's getting a free demo of FSD, it's somewhat likely the OP is a computer. ",
