    "text": "I just finished <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley_(TV_series)\">Ripley</a> on Netflix, an 8-part miniseries remake of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talented_Mr._Ripley_(film)\">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a>, which I remember, probably incorrectly, as a light-hearted story. There was very little to laugh about in this new version, but omg it is such a beautifully presented story. Even if you hated the plot you'd have to watch it just to see the art. And if you're Italian or love Italy, you have to watch it. Anyway now that I know all the twists and how it ends, I'm going to have to watch it again, but I might wait to recover from the experience. It is, at times, hard to watch. But oh so goooood. ",
