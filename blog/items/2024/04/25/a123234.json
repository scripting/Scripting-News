    "text": "ChatGPT has memory across chats. This just <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptmessage.png\">popped up</a> on the screen. I'd like to tell it that until further notice I use Node.js and do not use Express, and do use jQuery for my browser-based JavaScript, and I use the debugger all the time, so you can assume that. If this works, I now have a programming partner with memory. And maybe I can somehow get it to read all my blog posts going back 30 years? I have good archives of most of it. Also, of course I <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptcomments.png\">fed this post</a> to ChatGPT of course. So ChatGPT is not resting on its laurels. That's good. I'd really like a <i>Personal ChatGPT, </i>and this is on the way to that goal. ",
