For example, you'd keep the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html?title=markdownIsJustEnoughHtml\">Markdown</a> source for the page. When it was saved the system would re-render the Markdown, turning it into HTML, but you'd still have the Markdown around for editing. And of course there are other kinds of editors that make sense, knowing that the output is going to the web, but you don't have to <i>write</i> in the technical language of the web. You might want something more suited to wordsmiths -- ie <i>writers, </i>if you are a writer. I have that working here, and have been building on it.",
