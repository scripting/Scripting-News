    "text": "Quick <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY\">video demo</a> of <a href=\"https://meta.ai/\">meta.ai</a>. This is a demo of just one feature, its ability to recalc drawings as you edit the prompt that defines the picture. As you can tell from the demo I love it because it's new, creative, super fun to use and to watch the result. And lovely to see this much progress so quickly. You really should watch it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eVHcVYPFY\">on YouTube</a> so you can see how what I type relates to the image in real-time. It's like subtitles inverted, with a very knowledgeable, creative and high bandwidth computer network behind it. Living in the future.  ",
