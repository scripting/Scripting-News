    "text": "A big idea for the blogging world. I'd like to combine AI and search to make a really great search engine for bloggers. We would contribute what we know (we already do) and in return, along with everyone else, get to benefit from the collection. And when we browse, <i>it knows which blog we write.</i> So it has a very good idea of what we mean when we ask a question and what we already know. This is totally missing in ChatGPT and is something Google and other search engines have never been willing to do (or even understood, I guess). But this is a huge idea. I'd like to give it <a href=\"https://feedland.social/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=blogroll\">my blogroll</a> too, so it knows which sources I consider credible. I love that it creates an incentive to post to your blog, and it makes \"working together\" automatic. ",
