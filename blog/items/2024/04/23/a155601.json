    "text": "I was chatting with a friend who went to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science\">Bronx Science</a>, as I did, and we were talking about Isaac Asimov, and I said I thought he went to Science too. So I fired up ChatGPT and asked if Asimov went to Science, and <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/81199c5a-ca0a-4a2c-b610-e0799722a03f\">it said yes</a>. Then I asked where he went to high school and it said Bronx Science. But by then I was pretty sure he didn't, so I went to Google and meta.ai, and neither knew where he went to high school. So I asked on Twitter, Mastodon, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/112321321415008740\">Blue Sky</a> and Threads. Not sure why I even care! Oh well. :smile:",
