I would like to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dern8c/kevin_durant_explains_why_free_agents_wont_join/\">thank Kevin Durant</a> for saying the Knicks weren't cool. It's somewhat like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">Streisand Effect</a> where the thing KD was trying to hide was that <i>he</i> was no longer cool. Classic <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/projection\">projection</a>. Obviously he was not the hot shit he thought he was in 2019. :smile:",
