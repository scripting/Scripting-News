If you want to read the month in outline form, <a href=\"https://drummer.land/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2024/03.opml\">click this link</a> and it will open read-only in \"Drummer\". That's a pretty good approximation of how I edit it, except I use the desktop version of Drummer that writes files to the local Mac filesystem as well as to the cloud. ",
