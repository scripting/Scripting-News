    "text": "Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent <a href=\"http://home.rsscloud.co/\">rssCloud</a>? That's the kind of bullshit Google does. We don't do that in the open formats and protocols world. What really pains me is they claim to follow <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/\">my</a> Rules for Standards-makers. Imho they do not. Two rules apply. <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000\">Rule #1</a> says the only reason we do this is interop. It's called Rule #1 for a reason. And the <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000\">one way</a> rule a little further down the page. I've seen this happen twice where people say they abide by the <a href=\"https://this.how/standards/\">RFSM</a> but then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the name you've chosen. We've been down this path. The only way it ends is in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/134901.html?title=standardsKitty\">tears</a>. ",
