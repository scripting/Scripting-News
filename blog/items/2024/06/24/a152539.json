Big surprise they say pretty much exactly what they say on the news about the candidates, all of it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance#:~:text=False%20balance%2C%20known%20colloquially%20as,viewpoints%20than%20the%20evidence%20supports.\">bothsidesisms</a> and no mention of the fascism coming our way if we go one direction. It's all everyone's fault, so why bother voting, is mostly what they say. SMH in disbelief.",
