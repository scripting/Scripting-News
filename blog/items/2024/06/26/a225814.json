Twitter kicked butt when it came out in 2006 and the butt it kicked was the <i>feed</i>iverse. Why? Because it was too damned hard and unnecessarily complicated to subscribe to a feed. In Twitter there was a button on each feed page that said Subscribe. Click the button and you're subscribed. That's it. May sound like a small matter, but it's not. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. I've been dying to say that. 12 minutes. ",
