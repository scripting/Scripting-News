    "text": "According to reviewers <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hit-man/\">Hit Man</a> is a movie for adults, supposedly with a plot, writing, acting, from Netflix. Rated 83 on Metacritic (a must-see). I was excited! Watched it. It's like a TV sitcom. Ugh. <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/112581268426914314\">Zzzzz</a>. The main character has a nice-Brad Pitt like smile. Wears weird constumes. Finds a beautiful girlfriend. Best thing about it is that it takes place in New Orleans, so I could try to figure out where they were. That's about it. Much better implementation of a similar idea -- <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/emily-the-criminal/\">Emily the Criminal</a>. ",
