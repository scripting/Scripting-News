    "text": "It's been almost nine years since I did the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html\">podcast about podcasting</a>. Today I was asked how I feel about podcasting now. Here's what I said. It's still working -- people expect to have choice in where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that's true they will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over tomorrow, I'd be happy with the outcome. It's been over 20 years since we rolled it out, and it's still delivering huge value to lots of people, and isn't controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are no gatekeepers. If only we had been able to keep blogging free of that kind of control, but I have hope there too.",
