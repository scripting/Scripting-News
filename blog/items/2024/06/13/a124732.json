Talking with her the other day we decided this would be the opening scene of The NakedJen Movie. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xqiu0ekahw\">meaning</a> of the image is well-known to people who travel with the Dead, as Jen did. I've never been to a Dead concert with her, but I understand it's like going to a Comdex or MacWorld in the 80s or <a href=\"http://www.bricklin.com/albums/pcforum99/\">Esther's</a> or <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/digerati/alsop/\">Stewart's</a> conferences for me in the 90s. Sure you go for the music, but <i>mainly</i> you go to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html\">schmooze</a> in the hallways. I love talking with her on the phone the most. We have thought about doing a podcast, and even tried recording one, but our one-to-one conversations are much more interesting, and funny.
