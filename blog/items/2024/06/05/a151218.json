    "text": "Jon Stewart from this Monday is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmxzQJt80XI\">good to watch</a> as a reminder of what the press could be doing beyond what Jay Rosen recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice. (Update: <a href=\"https://x.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1798365545106141236\">Jay is on it</a>.)",
