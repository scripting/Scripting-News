I've always felt the money would be better spent in teaching anyone who wants to learn the basic skills and practices of journalism, so that lots of approaches are possible. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html\">Sources go direct</a>, ie blogging. I have long advocated that a semester of journalism should be encouraged or required for a university degree. What's the point of educating a mind if that mind doesn't know how to share the knowledge with others? My blogger colors are showing here. I still believe the people are our best hope. And I think journalism failed and propping it up <i>will</i> help keep reporters employed a little longer, but I don't think it will create a foundation that can be built on. We will still have an urgent need for news we can trust. ",
