    "text": "Yesterday the \"former president\" as he's referred to on TV, or <i>Mr President</i> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcsn_6Wln60\">NBC</a>, shared a post that said <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4209650-trump-shares-post-bashing-liberal-jews-who-voted-to-destroy-america/\">Jewish liberals</a> are destroying America. Let's mark this line clearly. Talk like that is full of alarm for Jewish people, esp those raised by people who survived the last holocaust. If this doesn't stop you in your tracks, then you probably won't notice when they start calling us vermin, restricting our movement, take our property, move us to ghettos and then systematically incinerate us the way you would rid yourself of an infestation. You know the old story about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog\">frog boiling in water</a>. We all are on that path. This was always where Make America Great Again was going, an America with all the Jews dead. That this isn't Story One on every front page and newscast says everything you need to know about how journalism is failing us.  ",
