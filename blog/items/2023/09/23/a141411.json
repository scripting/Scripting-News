    "text": "And btw it's nonsense about how masto, bluesky etc are not twitter-like. The only reason they have a shot is that people are looking for places to divert the energy they used to put into Twitter. You have to always be thinking about how you can make your product more comfortable to people who like(d) Twitter. One of the reasons Pebble and Bluesky are gaining traction is they are written by people who are very familiar with Twitter at a user level. But you <i>don't</i> have to stop where Twitter stopped. They had a lot of weird and imho wrong ideas about the value of limits. What's important is how the flow is presented. Musk's Twitter (the one he calls X) broke through the character limit without anyone noticing. I had been saying this is how it would work for (sadly) well over a decade. There are other things like this. Esp integration with other systems, esp blogs, it can be a lot easier than ActivityPub makes it. ",
