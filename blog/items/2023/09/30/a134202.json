I want to use one editor to write. My editor. The one that's wired into the base of my spine. Where I just think of something and somehow it gets from my brain to the screen. I don't ever have to think about how it works. Every time I have to switch gears because I forgot which editor I'm using, or where I have to go to read and edit something, I lose ideas, and punt on getting the writing right. I want text to flow from my editor to the places I write. I have to use your editor to write on your site, forget it. Also we have too much social media and not enough great reading sites. The reading experience of the web generally sucks.  ",
