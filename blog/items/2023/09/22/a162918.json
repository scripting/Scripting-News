How far removed from my existence. I was watching a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p66R294bDZc&t=429s\">clip</a> of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/08/01/1191242224/actor-paul-reubens-who-created-pee-wee-herman-dies-at-70\">Pee Wee Herman</a> and realize he was just as dead as Lucille Ball, Raymond Burr, Judy Garland, Jim Nabors, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe. For that matter he's just as dead as Ben Franklin.",
