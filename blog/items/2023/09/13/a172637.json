    "text": "The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/09/12.html#a174528\">idea</a> about people not learning to use computers really <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/111053438518110786\">resonated</a> with some. Almost no disagreement. I'd add that we now are going to get another shot at conceiving a computer that's a lot easier to use, with the power of AI. Remember the example where I was able to specify what was basically an <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/db76574b-e58c-4372-aa6a-4b7c1b872c39\">SQL query</a> in plain though precise English? That can also be applied to the user interface of a computer. Get me the phone number of the contractor I used to install the solar panels a few years ago. I'm sure the data is here on my computer, it might not be organized that way, but in a few months I'll have my own DaveBot who's read everything I've written everywhere and can answer all my questions (and yes, probably the CIA gets to ask questions too, let's hope Trump doesn't get elected, I'm not unaware of the dangers). And I won't have to remember how to build some app I wrote ten years ago. I won't even have to take notes. It's the paradise I never believed in is about to come to me. ",
