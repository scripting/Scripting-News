The movie is an ad for products you can buy <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/Barbie/Barbie/page/0716B6AC-A900-48E2-975E-E13245703AAF\">on Amazon</a>. The ultimate of exploitation. It got an <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/barbie/\">80 on Metacritic</a>. What is wrong with everyone! It was probably the worst movie ever made.",
