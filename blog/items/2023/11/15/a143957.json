    "text": "\"Textcasting\" and ActivityPub are not mutually exclusive. It would be great if an ActivityPub instance would also support the features outlined in the Textcasting <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/28/marshmallowManFromGhostbusters.png\">doc</a>. It's equally possible that a non-ActivityPub app could support Textcasting. It's like saying you can send an MP3 over email and over SMS. Textcasting is the MP3. As the Textcasting doc says I'm interested in supporting writers. Really if we work on it, we <i>can</i> have a great writing and reading environment. ",
