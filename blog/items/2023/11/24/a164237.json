    "text": "Christmas season is officially with us here in the United States, as today is our most commercially consumptive holiday, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)\">Black Friday</a>. Maybe the most American holiday of all. But it's also a time to be jolly and kind, nice not naughty, doing our part to consume at ever-increasing rates to keep the US economy humming. And it's a time for love, one hopes.

I did my part today, buying a nice curved monitor for my Mac mini, and a new smaller TV for the den. Socks and a couple of nice shirts.",
