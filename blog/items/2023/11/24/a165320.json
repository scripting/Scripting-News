    "text": "I'm working on a new version of the Scripting News home page, the first since 2017. There will be more tabs, that run down the left margin instead of the top. It'll have the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/homepage.html\">content</a> of Scripting News in the first tab, as it works now. And the <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/returnlinkbloghtml?url=http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml\">linkblog</a> will be the next tab. Then the tabs from <a href=\"http://news.scripting.com/\">news.scripting.com</a> followed by the About page <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/scripting/aboutpage.opml\">outline</a>. And lots of room for growth, for new ideas for writers and readers. As always I use my own site to experiment with new web ideas. ",
