    "text": "I asked DALL-E to help create an icon for <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter\">Feed Hunter</a>. I can't imagine an art director at an agency not using AI to play around with ideas for logos, symbols, ads, whatever. What I arrived at was a <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/09/feedHunterIcon.png\">tennis racket</a> trying to hit a cheeseburger. I didn't end up using it, but the exploration was useful. I think this process still has quite a ways to go, I find it difficult to control the bot, I give it explicit instructions sometimes that it apparently doesn't understand. But it's still a miracle of technology. And a miracle for this human, because I've found an artist that is infinitely patient with me, and works for $20 a month.",
