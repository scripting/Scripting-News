    "text": "I'm helping my friends at Automattic make <a href=\"https://doc.searls.com/\">Doc's blog</a> easier to read, esp on tablets which is where I end up reading most of his writing. I also never liked the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/02/docblogpic.png\">picture</a> someone put on Doc's blog. I guess if you squint it kind of looks like Doc, but that isn't how I see him. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/292425043\">This picture</a>, which I took at a nice breakfast place in Berkeley on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/11/08.html\">Nov 8, 2006</a>, is much more what I think of when I think of Doc. So is it fair to use a picture that's 17 years old? Sure! Most of the stuff on his blog was written then or before.  ",
