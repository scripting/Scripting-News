At first I was pretty negative, after the implosion of Twitter, here was another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey\">Jack Dorsey</a> network. I wasn't in the mood. But eventually I tried it, and I liked it very much. The mood is civil and often artistic. There are some very creative people there. And I think the API, while it's <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/892d671e-1dc9-4ffc-9101-cadbca842adc\">inscrutable</a> to me, is understandable to developers who put their minds to it, and I expect Colin is one who will figure it out. And I don't think there's any hope of ActivityPub, it's far too underspecified, and interop is likely to be product-based, not based on the protocol, where the Bluesky protocol appears to be overly-well-thought-out, or maybe the docs could have more examples. I didn't have the time to dive into it when I looked.",
