Sometimes it's <a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/diet-coke\">Diet Coke</a>, and other times, <a href=\"https://www.drpepper.com/s/products/diet-dr-pepper\">Diet Dr Pepper</a>. But for the last year or so the drink of choice around these parts is <a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/fresca-sparking-soda\">Fresca</a>. But you know what's funny. No matter what my favored drink is, it's always the one you can't get at the local <a href=\"https://stores.hannaford.com/ny/west-hurley/8444\">supermarket</a>. Always sold out. Very weird.",
