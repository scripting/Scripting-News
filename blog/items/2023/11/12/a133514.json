Yesterday I asked <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/11/11/013609.html\">ChatGPT to draw</a> me a image of an ancient band performing in the desert with cacti as the audience. Then this morning I had the idea of moving the concert into the pond behind my house, except this time <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/12/concertInThePond.png\">the audience are frogs</a>. I have a private Facebook group where I tell the story of the pond, including the animals who come to visit. Some of them I invent, they don't actually exist. And they have relationships with each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and relationships. And other people's models could incorporate mine. This was an idea I had for SimCity, and the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+world+outline\">web of outlines</a>, neither of which happened. Maybe it'll happen in LLM-land.",
