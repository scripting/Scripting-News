    "text": "Some news. I've been working with <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> for most of this year on a new version of \"FeedLand\" that runs in their cloud. The advantage is it will scale like the most popular websites, as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a> does. There have been lots of internal changes in the software, but at the same time, it still runs on a $10 a month <a href=\"https://feedland.org/\">Digital Ocean server</a>, and on desktops as well. The next FeedLand works at all these levels, for a person, a workgroup and the world. Obviously, lots more to say about all this. :smile:",
