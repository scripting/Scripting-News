    "text": "I added an item to the <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Fmisc%2Fartfeed.xml\">artcasting test feed</a>, and also added code in FeedLand to <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?river=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Fmisc%2Fartfeed.xml#\">display them</a>. On an initial <a href=\"http://news.scripting.com/\">browse</a> around other feeds and collections, it seems a few are using the enclosure for images in artful ways. Some of it is spammy, of course. Should've seen that coming. Heh. But we limit the vertical space a feed item gets in the timeline, you can see the whole thing by clicking on it, and clicking again after having a look. If you want to create a genuine art feed, then I want to make it look great in FeedLand. And keep the more rude feeds manageable. If you're playing around with artcasting, let me know, I'd like to see how others are doing, and share interesting stuff with people who follow this feed.",
