For example, this is the <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner&catname=tech\">link</a> for my Tech news category. Or the Bloggers tab on Scripting News can be accessed directly in FeedLand <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner&catname=bloggers\">like this</a>. \"By category\" is just one way FeedLand can display a timeline of news.
