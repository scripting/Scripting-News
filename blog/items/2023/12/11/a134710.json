    "text": "Starting in September or so I start thinking about <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty\">Blogger of the Year</a>, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many people care, but it's a good thing for me to do -- to review what makes a blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me -- obviously. We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved. People think \"well it's just me and I don't matter\" -- which is totally true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least <i>they'll</i> know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value, which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last year I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915\">chose</a> Heather Cox Richardson, whose <a href=\"https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/\">Substack site</a> is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different times, and if I'm up and in the mood, I'll spend a few minutes with HCR and it's always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.
