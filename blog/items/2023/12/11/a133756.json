    "text": "There's an interesting recent development in the world of feeds and blogs -- blogs that are only feeds. Designed to be read in feed readers of all sizes and shapes. I have a few of these myself. My <a href=\"http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml\">linkblog</a> for example. Also, FeedLand provides an outbound <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?myfeed\">feed to every user</a>, which meets all the qualifications of a feed-only blog. ",
