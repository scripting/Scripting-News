    "text": "The last episodes of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22\">The Crown</a> were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png\">Oh The Humanity</a>.",
