    "text": "I read <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2023/12/17/on_mastodon_support_in_netnewswire\">Brent's piece</a> on Mastodon and NetNewsWire, holding my breath hoping he'd arrive at the same answer I did, and he did. \"RSS\" is perfect for Mastodon, it supports RSS, as does NNW (of course), and that's imho exactly the right way to connect the two. That's how we're doing it in \"FeedLand\". And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the <a href=\"https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social\">feed</a> for Brent's account on Bluesky, and <a href=\"https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com\">mine</a>. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It's too good an opportunity to pass up. ",
