    "text": "So, with the \"Bloggers\" category not yet ready for prime time, I've replaced it with my <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner&catname=all\">All category</a> from FeedLand, changing the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/14/newstab.png\">title to News</a>. I know it's confusing. I think there's going to be a fair amount of this kind of shuffling in the weeks and months ahead, as we try to fit news and blogs together in interesting ways. You can read the Bloggers category on <a href=\"http://news.scripting.com/\">news.scripting.com</a>. ",
