    "text": "Yesterday I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021\">addressed</a> the How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write. I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love my writing. The tech industry, to the extent that they remember me, resents me. I get that. It's sad, because I do care, I am one of them, as Diana was one of the royals (see above). Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We weren't very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440\">hear from them</a>, and that's especially lovely. ",
