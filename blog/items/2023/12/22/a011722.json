Here's why. He took an <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C8-1/ALDE_00001126/\">oath</a> to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He did the opposite, he attacked the Constitution. So how can we ask him to take the same oath again, the one that he violated the last time he took it. The Constitution is very wise, it's what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou\">Maya Angelou</a> <a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_383371\">taught</a> -- when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. That's why he can't be president again. He can't be believed when he takes the oath, and if he can't take the oath he can't be President. ",
