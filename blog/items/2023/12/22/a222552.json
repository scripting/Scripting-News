Generally I can get it done in three or four moves. If it takes five it's because I made a mistake or took a gamble on the second move that didn't work out. These days I don't even try for the second move, but this morning, on the first move I got four out of the five letters, and got the correct position of two of the four. It took a couple of seconds to see that there was really only one answer, so I decided to risk it, and there was this moment we yearn for when the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg\">letters reveal</a> one at a time, all green, a final correct move, in two. First time I've ever gotten that result. I wasn't even sure it was possible. Well there it is. Almost <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/22/9999.png\">perfect</a>. Nothing more to say than Yay Me! ",
