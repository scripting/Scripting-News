    "text": "I had a long chat yesterday with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Guy+Kawasaki%22\">Guy Kawasaki</a>. Along the way he wondered how I find something to write every day. The answer -- I don't find things to write, it doesn't work that way. I don't sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write 1000 words and it doesn't matter what it's about. If I have something to say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say, because I'm always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get there. A lot of trial and error, let's see if this way of putting it works, or that one, etc. There's a slogan for this -- <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html\">Narrate Your Work</a> -- and my work is narratable and creates its own record because I do my work right <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021\">here</a>, because much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it. And if I can get the people I need to listen to me, ie read my blog, then we can work together (a recurring theme) to make great communication systems out of the web and avoid flushing our future down the toilet, which we always seem to be doing.
