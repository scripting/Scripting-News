If you're waiting for a big company to work with you, and we all are, the answer is you'll probably wait a long time, and you probably won't get there. It's not impossible, but it is improbable. So while you're waiting, why not work with a peer on solving a problem you both have in somewhat different ways, but make what you do compatible. That's what working together is about. It's not just that the people did it, but you created something that lives on that works together. There's even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH3ruuml-R4\">song</a> that goes with this. \"If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with.\"   ",
