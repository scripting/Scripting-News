There's value in Twitter that goes beyond the balance sheet and share price. I saw the opportunity in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html\">January 2017</a>, a few days before Trump was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump\">inaugurated</a>. Twitter had just elected a president. What is the dollar value of that? In the hands of someone who knows how to squeeze money from the US government, as Musk surely does (and Trump had no idea) -- it could be worth many more billions than he paid for Twitter.",
