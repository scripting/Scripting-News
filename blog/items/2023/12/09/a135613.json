This is where the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\">14th Amendment</a> came from. Some days Olbermann really nails it, this was one of those episodes, left me wanting more. This may be <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Impeached-President-Andrew-Johnson-Lincolns/dp/1416547509\">the book</a>, I'm still looking for suggestions. I am not a history scholar, just an interested citizen. ",
