    "text": "An alert to readers who remember how great it was to have Twitter be the meeting place for news people and their stories prior to the Musk takeover. I think Facebook's new <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/\">Threads service</a> is poised to replace Twitter in this role, once they add an API that allows pubs to post links to their stories on their service. We will, in a few weeks or months, wish we had proactively formed a non-Facebook news service, a place where by convention we know we can get links to the hot stories as they become available. I think Bluesky is the perfect place to go for this now, but it would require the company behind the service to work with news orgs and independent software developers to quickly build the network. It's possible. They already have the API, we just need to do a little marketing. It's even possible without the help of Bluesky itself, if a few leaders from the news industry got involved, either individuals like Jay Rosen, Emily Bell or Jeff Jarvis, or Richard Gingras who leads news at Google (who thankfully doesn't have a horse in this race) or a big news org or two, acting proactively against turning this valuable space over to a much untrusted big tech company like Facebook. (I don't call them Meta, I think that was a con to give them cover for exactly a move like this, who would ever trust Facebook with such power after what happened in the 2016 election, but <i>Meta</i> is just confusing enough.)",
