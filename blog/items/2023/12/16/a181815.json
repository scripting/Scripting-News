A bunch of my pieces really pissed him off, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/11/howInvestigativeResearchHa.html\">like this one</a>. You didn't have to guess where you stood with him. And he listened when you told him he was all fucked up and full of it and didn't understand the first thing about what you said. He was from Alaska and I am from the east and west coasts. We were friends. I'lll miss his caustic and broad dismissals. I knew then and now that his heart was in it, and it is a good heart. <span style=\"opacity: 0.4\">:heart:</span>",
