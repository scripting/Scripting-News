    "text": "We're easing into the holiday period now, just had my last meeting in 2023. I want to thank the people at <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> who helped get us over the top with FeedLand running in their fantastic cloud. The software is <s>finished</s> running now, modulo bug fixes, docs, examples, developer tools, user evangelism, and working with other developers to make feeds live up to the enormous potential, which imho has been laying dormant for far too many years. Specifically thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christie-j-wright/\">Christie Wright</a> for taking this project under her wing. I can't believe how fast the software runs in its <a href=\"https://feedland.com/\">new home</a>. We're set up for a great 2024. :boom:",
