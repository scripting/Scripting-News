We asked them to support image enclosures (aka artcasting) in <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fphotos%2Ffeed%2F\">their feed</a>. They just did. And as a result their flow <a href=\"https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fphotos%2Ffeed%2F\">looks outstanding</a> on FeedLand, which totally supports this format. This is a bell-ringer event, this is what we're about -- building up and out from where we are in the land of feeds. We can do a lot if we work together. ",
