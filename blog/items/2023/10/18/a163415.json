    "text": "Twitter <i>is</i> a <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/x-twitter-elon-musk-israel-hamas-gaza-misinformation-meta-threads.html?via=rss\">shell of its former self</a>, I can see that in my own behavior. I used to help out voluntarily to vet posts their bots thought were questionable, but I don't do that any more. I don't feel any sense of ownership of Twitter. Looking back, it's surprising that I ever did. I also used to run polls there, but I don't do that any longer. And when something new is happening, I have no idea where to go, but I don't go to Twitter like I used to. These are facts. Not anything I ever weighed and <i>decided</i> to stop doing, I just don't do them. And yes I think it's a good thing that the fog of Twitter is clearing. There was a time when I hoped interesting ideas would pop up in the blogosphere, but then we got lost in all the bullshit of Twitter, and now that's over. So maybe there's room for the web being used, once again, as a way of connecting real people in smaller numbers. ",
