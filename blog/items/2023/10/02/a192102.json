    "text": "The other day I sent an email to Seth Godin, who I had been chatting with in the early days of ChatGPT about how we both wanted a chatbot that had ingested our blog archives, and could find trends in it, the way you can ask ChatGPT <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/39792c5b-946f-47f7-8ee3-19d54ca220ee\">questions like this</a>. They're getting to know me better, even though they say they stopped ingesting in 2021. Seth got his chatbot first, I tried it out, but didn't think it had achieved what ChatGPT had. Now first, I want to say Automattic as a company has been a good friend, esp in the last year. I've done a few projects with them recently, none of which have become public. They also saved the Harvard blog server I started in 2003. So I like them. But I don't find the chatbot they did for me, and it turns out Seth too, nearly as useful even for the limited domain of my blog, as ChatGPT is. My email to Seth asked if he found his chatbot from A8C useful? Instead of the thoughtful reply I expected, his response said <i>Thanks Dave!  </i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfE93xON8jk\">Bummer</a>. I thought perhaps he'd <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwSh0dAaqIA\">hear me better</a> if I wrote a blog post? BTW, I thought <a href=\"https://seths.blog/2023/10/but-it-matters-a-lot-to-them/\">today's post</a>, about what creative people want, hit the spot perfectly. I want people to <i>use</i> my art. Without that, I don't connect. ",
