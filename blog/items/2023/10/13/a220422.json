    "text": "Just listened to an hour of McCartney on Apple Music, and I love his stuff, but the best songs he did were collaborations with the rest of the band. No one of them had the magic, it was all of them. Take a minute and listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLRiGX3L-kw\">Lady Madonna</a>. Lennon says <a href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/every-song-by-the-beatles-john-lennon-hated/\">he didn't like</a> it, but I can hear him in it. It's got the edge that McCartney alone doesn't have. Compare it to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdDPR8GzXy8\">Maybe I'm Amazed</a>, the first song that the bot picked. It's like listening to part of one channel of a Beatles song. ",
