    "text": "<a href=\"https://music.amazon.com/\">Amazon Music</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloton\">Peloton</a> go so well together. I'm surprised one of the music companies doesn't buy Peloton which I hear is struggling. I'm always looking for music with a strong steady beat. For the beginning of the workout I go with songs that are steady but relatively slow, to warm up to -- like Eric Clapton's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYS732zyYfU&t=76s\">Cocaine</a>. It's perfect. But as I rev up I go for music with a faster strong steady beat. For that nothing like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Costello\">Elvis Costello</a>. For example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y71iDvCYXA\">Pump It Up</a>, which is <i>sooo</i> perfect for Peloton. Oh my god. I'm listening to it now, and I'm moving, even though I just started work for the day. Really gets you going. If you don't believe me try playing it <a href=\"https://genius.com/Elvis-costello-pump-it-up-lyrics\">now</a>. \"Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven sent. Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander. There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand.\" <i>Oh mama mia.</i>",
