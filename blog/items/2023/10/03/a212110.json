    "text": "Just read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblogs.com\">Wikipedia page</a> on weblogs.com. I didn't \"decide\" to shut down the site in 2004. The management of UserLand at the time transfered the domain to one of my two servers at a local Boston-area hosting service, without telling me they were doing it. It knocked the server off the air. That was what caused the outage. It took a few days to get it back online. The secret -- we converted the site to PHP and it ran much better. No one <i>decided</i> anything. ",
