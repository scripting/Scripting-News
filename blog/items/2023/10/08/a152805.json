    "text": "Interesting perspective shift. I saw there's a new <a href=\"https://shop.bcs.org/store/221/detail/workgroup?id=3-221-9781780176413\">book</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pesce\">Mark Pesce</a> about AI systems, and it gets pretty technical. I was surprised because I thought he was a pundit (which he is) but unlike most tech pundits, he also knows how to program. More than that. I remember the first time I had a real talk with a famous tech pundit in the 80s and was shocked that he knew nothing about the ones and zeros. Didn't these people at least take <a href=\"https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science\">Intro to Computer Science</a> in college? Shouldn't that be a basic prerequesite for selling one's opinions about tech? Now many years later I'm surprised to see one that does.  ",
