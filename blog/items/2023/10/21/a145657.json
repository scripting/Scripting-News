I can <a href=\"https://social.masto.land/@dave/111273568591273761\">write a post</a> on a Mastodon instance that supports Markdown and I can <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/111273568903593372\">view it</a> in a Mastodon instance that doesn't support Markdown, and it handles it properly. I wonder where the rendering is being done. An incentive to use a server that supports Markdown. The <a href=\"https://social.masto.land/home\">server</a>, which I am operating, also has a character limit of 10000, which is effectively no limit. I think perhaps the dust is starting to settle on Masto, the fog is lifting. Maybe a subset of servers, called Maxtodon perhaps, would be the service worth paying for. ",
